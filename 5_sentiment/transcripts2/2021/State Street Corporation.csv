Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating",984,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in 2020 supporting our clients, communities in the financial system, all while advancing and positioning the business for future success. 
2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile the operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop, government, central banks and financial institutions like State Street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address. When faced with these economic and social challenges, I am proud of how State Street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020. 
As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products, services and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continue to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations, increasing automation and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business. State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last 2 years, and we expect that we'll be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive cost lower, self-fund investments for the future and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the #1 market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue. We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the State Street Alpha front-to-back platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers, unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed 6 Alpha clients in 2020, where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains strong. 
While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remain laser-focused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We recently enhanced our institutional services client-facing strategy. And during '19 -- during 2021, we will leverage improvements in client coverage, segments and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model and the commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial performance, which I will now discuss further. 
Turning to Slide 3. Fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 or $1.69, excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items. At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels, supported by higher period end markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both businesses provide good step-off points for 2021. 
Turning to our full year 2020 results. We made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32 or $6.70, excluding notable items. EPS results were up 17% and 9%, excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment. Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results and a higher revenue contribution from CRD, which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%. However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII. Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history. 
To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020. As a result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges, all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-year earnings growth for our shareholders. As we look ahead for the first quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to 475 million of common stock repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the Board has also authorized the partial redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. And then I will return to update you on our medium-term targets."

Turning to Slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021. First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This complements the senior management reductions we made 2 years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year. 
Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered 2 years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 5. I will begin my review of both our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence of the $20 million third quarter true-up combined with a stronger-than-expected balance sheet growth led to a 4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses ex notables were flat year-on-year but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, including currency translation and higher variable costs. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension of buybacks, we delivered full year positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pretax margin and EPS growth rate of 9%, excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board. 
Turning to Slide 6. Period end, AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased a result of higher period end market levels and better client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line. Our Spider ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows, driven by strong U.S. and European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full year, almost 30% higher than last year. 
Now on to Slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year, including currency translation. The increase reflects higher average market levels, softer-than-expected sales in 2020 as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter, including currency translation as higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity. On the bottom left of this slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed, amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year. The amount of gross wins needed to offset these factors will vary year-to-year and be impacted by a number of factors, including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half AUC/A wins, though, as I have mentioned before, the sales cycle and installation of these more complex solution focused services take some time. In 2020, we've had some strong success in growth across our top 50 asset manager clients as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales to our mid- sized asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity. On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy, which involves expanding coverage to a total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I begin, you will notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM-based fees that global advisers receives for acting as the marketing agent for the Spider Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors. Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3%, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation. Year-on-year, management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows, I mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows. Our fourth quarter investment management pretax margin reached 32%, which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating leverage. Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to $10 million per quarter of company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly. FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top-ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes as well as stronger market-making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of ever-changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surge of approximately 30% will obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult. Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger CRD revenue and positive market-related adjustments. 
Moving to Slide 9. We show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into its 3 categories given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting standard for on-prem revenues in particular. Fourth quarter CRD revenues fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2019 but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD well strategy earlier in the year, with total stand-alone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front-to-back platform sales during 2020. In total, we signed 6 Alpha clients during the year, including 3 in 4Q, which included 1 new client and 2 clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformational or potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs. 
Turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million and approximately $5 million of episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end, were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields. Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here as we put the $17 billion of the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time. On the right side of the slide, we show our end-of-period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter, I noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits, but that our deposit levels might increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we've begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposits and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher. We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio, but we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from interest rate changes. 
On Slide 11, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 4Q '20 expenses were held flat year-on-year but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about 1 point in the fourth quarter. Relative to the third quarter and ex notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10% quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub custody balances and brokerage volumes. Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees. For the full year, total expenses were down approximately 1.5% ex notables relative to 2019, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses, self-fund investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021, which I will detail shortly. 
Moving to Slide 12. On the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020 as we supported clients with the MMF, and we thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support NII.. On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements. As Ron noted, we are excited that our Board authorized a new common share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $475 million, and which is in line with the new Fed limits. We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in 2Q. 
Turning to Slide 13. You could see a summary of our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail, so let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns. Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a 6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our coverage of our top 50 clients and we executed on our Alpha strategy, leading to an increase in servicing fees by 2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround. At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business had a very strong year with total flows up 30% year-on-year, and our cash business performing quite well. Our FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020 as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes, and we reaped the benefit of our prior investments in our #1 position with asset managers. On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cost out of the business, recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction, excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities. All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pretax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds, and GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021, so let me get into it. 
Turning to Slide 14. Let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain relatively flat, and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage point-to-point growth from equity markets in 2021 as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue. We currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue ex trading will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single digits, perhaps down 2% to 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March. Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we expect NII to be down about 6% to 8% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly. Turning to expenses. As you can see in the we expect expenses ex notables will be flat to down 1% on a nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization and currently assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha and tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during 2021 of at least 1/3 of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for 2021. 
And and with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium-term targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remain unchanged, as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect that these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors. We set these medium-term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in 2019. And then again, as COVID hit in 2020, the market went from expecting in 2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019 to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate by rate expect -- with no rate hikes expected until at least 2023. Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.9% level at the time we gave the targets to just to average just 90 basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environment since 4Q '18 has impacted our 4Q '20 pretax margin by about 5 percentage points and ROE by around 2.5 percentage points. We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in U.S. equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last 2 years were down. While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business. We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provider, while at the same time, enhancing our investment servicing capabilities and client coverage, distinguishing us from our competitors. We've also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items, which has helped us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results. 
In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium-term targets, I am confident in the direction of our business and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth, while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business because at the end of the day, that is part of what we do every day, and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points, and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that. And we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see. Now in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus. But I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where we rolled out a coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments. And now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of the franchise."

And therefore, we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities or distribution access to this. So we are -- it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answer it more or less the same way that we're constantly thinking about this. We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, fixed -- for example, fixed income ETF, ESG capabilities. We launched the low-cost range of funds. We created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds. So we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities if we think it's the best outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for -- it's a remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for growth."

Let me describe first, maybe third quarter to fourth quarter, to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of the -- what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwind",499,"Ken, it's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first, maybe third quarter to fourth quarter, to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of the -- what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously. And that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now that will come back to -- because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind. Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at -- to the tune of about $20 million. And that was a larger build than usual, but a renumerative one. And so those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q. I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces. The investment portfolio headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral, we think, from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about $10. And then we still have a couple of headwinds. We have the unwind of that swap mark-to-market, which sequentially, it's worth 10 because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another 10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave. Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization. And what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind, which was $35 million, becoming $25 million, is going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that? Partly rates have been kind of working through the -- on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds, we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus 10%. And so we'll be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it will be range bound. And obviously, it will be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into. But that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth."

I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right? We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers and our business is more geared to asset managers than the other segments. And so we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually done quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well. Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year -- last 2 years, the last year in particular, we've actually secured more growth in the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data. And either less growth or in some cases, decline in the midsize and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that could happen in a particular quarter or a year, could be a 2 percentage point growth gap. It could be a 3- or 4 percentage point growth gap. It bounces around. And so what we're finding is that we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focus on the largest of our clients. But our midsized clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them. We provide really, I think, outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding -- we need to spend both senior time on the midsized clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives. And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer, and make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for a top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players. And really executing in that area, day in, day out, product 1, product 2, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of where we're focused now."

I think the -- what -- the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. And that was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind, including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million, $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards. In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy. On deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supplied by, what, about $120 billion a month. We're a 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to risk on to risk off to barbelling. So I think right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not at this point expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond as that happens. 
In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank because we can certainly take some risk on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder do you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can edge or leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short term. And we're -- our investors are always kind of carefully thinking about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS, you've seen us build up our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment-protected subsegments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there, too, because credit is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach, I think is the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities and I think as we see some of those, we'll act, then we'll certainly report on them to all of you."

I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, you look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest-growing segment or the segment that accounted for the most growth was, in fact, our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition, we weren't adding many to that, if any. But what we were doing was growing substantially in there. And that will be a key part of our growth going forward for both traditional asset servicing products as some of these providers continue to consolidate -- some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front-to-back Alpha activities as we install either fully install alpha or even put Charles River in  a situation where we have the middle and the back office, but not the front. So that's a key part of it. As we think about the numbers, certainly, the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer and the indexer as attractive. We always look for those opportunities. That's not in the assumption that Eric is describing there. So what we really were trying to do here in response to many questions we've gotten is more or less dimension of what we need to do to grow revenue. Obviously, that number, it's based on averages. So to the extent to which in a given year or a given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously, the 1.5 lien goes down. So that's the way to think about it. You could never -- at the end of any particular quarter, say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there, are you making it or not making -- you got to go 1 click down and say what was the nature of the kind of underlying business, which you'll be able to understand from us."

There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients because there's some tolling that we do for that. In particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated. ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements. I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, that -- those -- some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful. Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it will probably be a 1% headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right? If there's an equity market tailwind or headwind that matters, this client activity matters as well. Net new business, right, in particular, I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters. And then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels."

Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in 2020 supporting our clients, communities and the financial system, all while advancing and positioning the business for future success.
2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile the operating market -- operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop, government, central banks and financial institutions like State Street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address. When faced with these economic and social challenges, I am proud of how State Street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020.
As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products, services and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continue to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations, increasing automation and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business.
State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last 2 years, and we expect that we'll be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive cost lower, self-fund investments for the future and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the #1 market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue. We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the State Street Alpha front-to-back platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers, unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed 6 Alpha clients in 2020, where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains strong.
While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remain laser-focused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We recently enhanced our institutional services client-facing strategy, and during '19 -- and during 2021, we will leverage improvements in client coverage, segments and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model and the commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial performance, which I will now discuss further.
Turning to Slide 3. Fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 or $1.69 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items. At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels, supported by higher period end markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both businesses provide good step-off points for 2021.
Turning to our full year 2020 results. We made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32 or $6.70 excluding notable items. EPS results were up 17% and 9% excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment. Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results and a higher revenue contribution from CRD, which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%. However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII. Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history.
To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020. As a result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges, all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-year earnings growth for our shareholders. As we look ahead for the first quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $475 million of common stock repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the Board has also authorized the partial redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. And then I will return to update you on our medium-term targets."

Turning to Slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021. First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This complements the senior management reductions we made 2 years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year.
Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post-COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered 2 years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021.
Turning to Slide 5. I will begin my review of both our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence of the $20 million in third quarter true-up combined with a stronger-than-expected balance sheet growth led to a 4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses ex notables were flat year-on-year but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, including currency translation and higher variable costs. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension of buybacks, we delivered full year positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pretax margin and EPS growth rate of 9% excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board.
Turning to Slide 6. Period end AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and better client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line. Our SPDR ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows, driven by strong U.S. and European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full year, almost 30% higher than last year.
Now on to Slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year, including currency translation. The increase reflects higher average market levels, softer-than-expected sales in 2020 as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter, including currency translation as higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity. On the bottom left of this slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter.
As we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year. The amount of gross wins needed to offset these factors will vary year to year and be impacted by a number of factors, including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half AUC/A wins, though, as I have mentioned before, the sales cycle and installation of these more complex solution-focused services take some time.
In 2020, we've had some strong success in growth across our top 50 asset manager clients as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales through our mid-sized asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity. On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy, which involves expanding coverage to a total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies.
Turning to Slide 8. Let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I begin, you will notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM-based fees that Global Advisors receives for acting as the marketing agent for the SPDR Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors. Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3%, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation. Year-on-year management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows, I mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows.
Our fourth quarter investment management pretax margin reached 32%, which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating leverage. Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to $10 million per quarter company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly.
FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top-ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes as well as stronger market-making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of ever-changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surge of approximately 30% will obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult. Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger CRD revenue and positive market-related adjustments.
Moving to Slide 9. We show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into its 3 categories given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting standard for on-prem revenues in particular. Fourth quarter CRD revenues fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2019 but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD wealth strategy earlier in the year, with total stand-alone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019.
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front-to-back platform sales during 2020. In total, we signed 6 Alpha clients during the year, including 3 in 4Q, which included 1 new client and 2 clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformational potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs.
Turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million, and approximately $5 million of episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields. Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here as we put the $17 billion of the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time.
On the right side of the slide, we show our end-of-period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter, I noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits, but that our deposit levels might increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we've begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposits and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher. We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio, but we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from interest rate changes.
On Slide 11, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 4Q '20 expenses were held flat year-on-year but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about 1 point in the fourth quarter. Relative to the third quarter and ex notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10% quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub custody balances and brokerage volumes.
Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees. For the full year, total expenses were down approximately 1.5% ex notables relative to 2019, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses, self-fund investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021, which I will detail shortly.
Moving to Slide 12. On the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020 as we supported clients with the MMLF, and we thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support NII. On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements.
As Ron noted, we are excited that our Board authorized a new common share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $475 million, and which is in line with the new Fed limits. We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in 2Q.
Turning to Slide 13. You could see a summary of our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail, so let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns. Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a 6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our coverage of our top 50 clients, and we executed on our Alpha strategy, leading to an increase in servicing fees by 2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround.
At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business had a very strong year with total flows up 30% year-on-year, and our cash business performing quite well. Our FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020 as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes, and we reaped the benefit of our prior investments in our #1 position with asset managers.
On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cost out of the business, recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities. All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pretax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds, and GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021, so let me get into it.
Turning to Slide 14. Let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain relatively flat, and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage point-to-point growth from equity markets in 2021 as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses.
So beginning with revenue. We currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue ex trading will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single digits, perhaps down 2% to 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March.
Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we expect NII to be down about 6% to 8% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count, and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly.
Turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex notables will be flat to down 1% on a nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization and currently assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha and tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during 2021 of at least 1/3 of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for 2021.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium-term targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 or on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remain unchanged, as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect that these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors.
We set these medium-term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in 2019 and then again, as COVID hit in 2020. The market went from expecting in 2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019 to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate hikes expect -- with no rate hikes expected until at least 2023. Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.90% level at the time we gave the targets to just -- to average just 90 basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environment since 4Q '18 has impacted our 4Q '20 pretax margin by about 5 percentage points and ROE by around 2.5 percentage points. We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in U.S. equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last 2 years were down.
While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business. We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provider, while at the same time, enhancing our investment servicing capabilities and client coverage, distinguishing us from our competitors. We've also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items, which has helped us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results.
In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium-term targets, I am confident in the direction of our business, and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth, while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals.
With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business because at the end of the day, that is part of what we do every day, and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points, and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that. And we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see.
Now in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus. But I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where we rolled out a coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments. And now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of the franchise."

We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, fixed -- for example, fixed income ETF, ESG capabilities. We launched the low-cost range of funds. We created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds.

Let me describe first maybe third quarter to fourth quarter, to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of the -- what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds",498,"Ken, it's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first maybe third quarter to fourth quarter, to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of the -- what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously. And that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now that will come back because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind.
Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at -- to the tune of about $20 million. And that was a larger build than usual, but a remunerative one. And so those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q.
I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces. The investment portfolio headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral, we think, from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about $10. And then we still have a couple of headwinds. We have the unwind of the swap mark-to-market which sequentially is worth $10 because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another $10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave.
Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization. And what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind, which was $35 million, becoming $25 million, is going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that? Partly rates have been kind of working through the -- on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds, we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus $10 million. And so we'll be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it will be range bound. And obviously, it will be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into. But that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth."

I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right? We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers, and our business is more geared to asset managers than the other segments. And so we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually had quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well.
Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year -- last 2 years, the last year in particular, we've actually secured more growth in the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data. And either less growth or in some cases, decline in the midsize and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2-percentage point growth gap. It could be a 3- or 4-percentage point growth gap. It bounces around. And so what we're finding is that we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focus on the largest of our clients. But our midsized clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them. We provide really, I think, outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding -- we need to spend both senior time on the midsized clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives.
And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer, and make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players. And really executing in that area, day in, day out, product 1, product 2, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of granularity where we're focused now."

I think the -- what -- the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. And that was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind, including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million, $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards.
In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy. On deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supplied by, what, about $120 billion a month. We're a 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to risk on to risk off to barbelling. So I think right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not at this point expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond as it happens.
In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank because we can certainly take some risk on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder do you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can edge or leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short term. And we're -- our investors are always kind of carefully thinking about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS, you've seen us build up our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment-protected subsegments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there too, because credit is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach, I think is the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities, and I think as we see some of those, we'll act, and we'll certainly report on them to all of you."

I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, you look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest-growing segment or the segment that accounted for the most growth was, in fact, our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition, we weren't adding many to that, if any. But what we were doing was growing substantially in there. And that will be a key part of our growth going forward for both traditional asset servicing products as some of these providers continue to consolidate -- some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front-to-back Alpha activities as we install -- either fully install Alpha or even put Charles River in, in a situation where we have the middle and the back office, but not the front. So that's a key part of it.
And as we think about the numbers, certainly, the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer and the indexer is attractive. We always look for those opportunities. That's not in the assumption that Eric is describing there. So what we really were trying to do here in response to many questions we've gotten is more or less dimension of what we need to do to grow revenue. Obviously, that number, it's based on averages. So to the extent to which in a given year or a given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously, the $1.5 trillion goes down. So that's the way to think about it. You could never, at the end of any particular quarter, say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there, are you making it or not making -- you got to go 1 click down and see what was the nature of the kind of underlying business, which you'll be able to understand from us."

There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients because there's some tolling that we do for that. In particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated. ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements.
I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, that -- those -- some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful.
Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it'll probably be a 1% headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right? If there's an equity market tailwind or headwind that matters, this client activity matters as well. Net new business, right, in particular, I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters. And then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels."

Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we are operating in today compared to this time last year,",1259,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we are operating in today compared to this time last year, and then highlight some of the data that evidence the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise, all the while being an essential partner for our clients. 
Relative to the first quarter of 2020, the first 3 months of 2021 could hardly be more different. Economic activity is sharply rebounding, unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in 2020. Although short-end rates remain at historically low levels, long-end U.S. bond yields are rebounding. While COVID-19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world, there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. The owners and managers of the world's capital are also looking to the future and to the next stage of growth. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow, we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions. 
As demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, State Street continues to successfully navigate the improving operating environment. Although, as I noted, short-term interest rates, which compressed further during the first quarter, remain a critical headwind for our industry. While we cannot control interest rates, we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsource solutions provider, underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our State Street Alpha front-to-back platform. And we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons. First, we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis, and our clients know that they can depend on the services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad. 
Second, throughout the crisis, we continue to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model, client service and operational resiliency, which has been apparent to and noted by our clients. 
Third, many clients are reassessing their own operating models. And as a result, we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities, allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients. 
Fourth, our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines. I am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service. 
Last, both our Alpha and non-Alpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take-up as demonstrated by some recent announcements. For example, we reported an additional 3 State Street Alpha clients during the first quarter. And separately, this morning, we announced a full front-to-back Alpha relationship with Invesco, adding front and middle office services to our existing back-office mandates. 
Through the open architecture nature of our operating platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships, unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our Alpha value proposition, which is appealing to clients. After quarter end, we announced that M&G has appointed us to provide outsourced middle office services in addition to our existing fund accounting and custody services. State Street will administer the middle office services on Aladdin, exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their front-end and middle office systems. 
These deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win front-to-back mandates as well as to win new business as a result of the interoperable nature of our operating platform. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy, we also continue to innovate across our franchise. For example, our growing demand exists for ESG solutions that will provide the necessary data, risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale. To that end, during the first quarter, we introduced enhancements to our ESG solutions and can now provide clients with the ability to address new global ESG regulatory requirements for a single platform. 
Global Advisors, a new U.S. corporate ESG ETF, launched in EMEA in late 2020 and grew to $5.4 billion of AUM by the end of the first quarter, making it the largest corporate bond ESG fund in the USAT space. 
We also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing [indiscernible] We recently announced our intention to service the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF. Subject to regulatory approval, we will work with VanEck to provide services, including ETF basket operations, custody of the ETF shares, fund accounting, order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions. 
Next, I will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 3, first quarter EPS was $1.37, or $1.47 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter total revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, total fee revenue increased 4%, driven by servicing and management fee growth, which increased 7% and 6% year-over-year, respectively, as well as an improved software and processing fee performance. Collectively, these more than offset the year-over-year headwind from FX trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year. While our FX trading revenues are down year-over-year, first quarter revenue remains well above pre-pandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent in [indiscernible] 
Even with rising total fee revenue, first quarter total expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off. Furthermore, we have successfully reduced high-cost location headcount relative to the period 1 year ago. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of 2021.
At the end of the first quarter, AUCA and AUM both increased to record levels, supported by higher period end markets. AUCA increased to $40.3 trillion. New asset servicing wins were a solid $343 billion, while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Global Advisors' AUM increased to $3.6 trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in ETFs and a solid performance in the cash business. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 14% to $225 million, and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling our Alpha strategy. Overall, we had a strong start to the year, and we remain confident that we have a clear path for our medium-term targets as we discussed in January. 
To conclude, we continue to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid improving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results. We remain focused on partly developing and growing our Alpha offering, and I'm pleased with the recent client activities. Meanwhile, we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise. 
During the first quarter, we returned $659 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends. For the second quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases, consistent with the limits set by the Fed. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."
188785,707885880,2252560,"State Street Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2021",2021-04-16,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone.

We reported EPS of $1.37, or $1.47 excluding the impact of notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on th",2400,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.37, or $1.47 excluding the impact of notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide. 
On the left of the slide, you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth, while expenses were well controlled despite higher market values and client volumes. As a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the year ago period, we also show our first quarter results, excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-over-year or up 2%, excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic. For context, total fee revenue, excluding FX trading services, was up 9% year-on-year, or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with strong mid-single-digit growth in servicing fees, management fees and securities finance. 
Expenses were roughly flat year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. So in total, this was a solid quarter, demonstrating the progress we're making in improving our operating model as we drive towards growth. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see strong business volume growth across the franchise. Period-end AUCA increased 26% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $40 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period-end market levels, client flows and net new business growth. Quarter-on-quarter, AUCA increased the result of higher period-end equity market levels, better client flows and net new business which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets. We're seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines, and we're seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now custody. 
At Global Advisors, AUM increased 34% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.6 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net ETF and cash inflows. Our ETF franchise had a strong flow performance again as the U.S. ETF industry experienced record flows. Spider net inflows amounted to over $23 billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low cost doing particularly well. 
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were also up 5% quarter-on-quarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity. This quarter, we saw good growth in asset managers, alternatives and official institutions. 
I'm pleased with how 2021 has started as the first quarter AUCA wins totaled a solid $343 billion, which is up from recent quarters. And for context, last quarter, you heard me outline that we need approximately $1.5 billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth, which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business. 
I'm also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broad-based growth across our clients, segments and regions. As an example, you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter, we announced that we have assumed the depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo in Europe. AUCA 1 but yet to-be-installed amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Positively, both our reported wins and to-be-installed numbers exclude the 2 recently announced mandates, which Ron mentioned just a moment ago, as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me discuss several other important fee revenue lines in more detail. First quarter management fees were $493 million, up 6% year-on-year, including a 2% impact from currency translation, but were flat quarter-on-quarter. Both our year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our ETF and cash businesses, partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers. 
Regarding money market fee waivers, we had about $15 million this quarter, and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in short-end rates in March. If they persist, we expect company-wide impact to be around $50 million to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in 2Q and of distribution fees, though higher balances should be worth roughly $150 million per quarter, leaving the net impact closer to $40 million per quarter. 
FX trading services had yet another strong quarter relative to the exceptional first quarter of 2020, FX trading revenue fell 22% year-on-year, but it was up 7% quarter-on-quarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs. While FX market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher client volumes as our FX business continue to benefit from many years of investment across 6 venues and now 47 markets, 3 of which we added and 2 of which we expanded in the last year alone. 
Our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth, increasing 8% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program. 
Finally, our first quarter software and processing fees were up 55% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter largely due to changes in mark-to-market adjustments. 
Moving to Slide 8, we have here CRD stand-alone revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into 3 categories to help see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for on-premise revenue. Total CRD revenues increased 4% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher software-enabled revenue and was 10% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely due to seasonally higher on-premise revenues in the fourth quarter. 
As shown on this slide, the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues increased by a strong 21% combined growth rate relative to the year ago period. 
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the first quarter highlights of State Street Alpha. We reported an additional 3 alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base, and this doesn't include this morning's first quarter and quarter end announcement. The Alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the Alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure. 
Turning to Slide 9. First quarter NII declined 30% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of a $20 million market-related benefits in the first quarter of 2020. Quarter-on-quarter, NII declined 6% as expected. Around 3% of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower long-end rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarter's downdraft in short-end rates on our sponsored member repo activity, and the rest was due to the lumpier items, including day count. These impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances, as you can see on the right of the slide. 
Total average deposits increased by $20 billion in the first quarter or an increase of 10% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy. 
We remain mindful of OCI risk to our capital. So as the U.S. Treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter, we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates. 
Turning to Slide 10, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are clearly evident. Excluding notable items, first quarter expenses increased 2% year-on-year, which is all driven by the weaker dollar, which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat year-on-year. On a line item basis, compensation employee benefits was up only 1%, excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. 
Information systems and communication expenses were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing expenses were up just 1% ex FX as our savings initiatives offset significant volume-based growth in subcustody and market data costs. Occupancy and other expenses were both down several points. 
Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation. Overall, I'm pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately $15 million of variable revenue-related costs. We continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation, reengineering and scale. 
Moving to Slide 11, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year, but fell 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 10.8%. Relative to the fourth quarter, our capital base was impacted by lower AOCI as a result of the significant run-up in long-end U.S. treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced lift-up deal we completed with Intesa Sanpaolo. 
We also saw a $6 billion increase in episodic RWA, primarily related to FX trading and overdraft activity. This RWA headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by $5 billion. So at the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio will be over 11%, all else being equal. Tier 1 leverage was down year-over-year and fell by 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%, primarily as a result of higher average assets, driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the AOCI change and the $500 million partial call for Series F preferred securities announced in January. 
As you can see on the slide, and as I mentioned previously, we continue to consider a CET1 target range of 10% to 11% as appropriate level of capital for our business. Further, we consider that a Tier 1 leverage ratio between 5.25% and 5.75% as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits. 
Last, as we look ahead and as Ron noted, for the second quarter of 2020, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases, consistent with the limit set by the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 12, we provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise. 
Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-on-year, including the significant year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year. And excluding FX trading services, total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation, with solid mid-single-digit growth across servicing fees, management fees and sec lending. And with that strong top line fee growth, expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation, demonstrating the progress we're making in improving our operating model. 
Next, I would like to update our full year economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our full year interest rate outlook assumes that short-end rates remain pressured, and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve, in line with the current forwards, which suggests modestly improving premium amortization, so the pace of improvement remains uncertain. We're also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year, or up around 10% point-to-point from the beginning of 2021 as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. 
In terms of the second quarter of 2021, our guide includes about 2 percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and 2 percentage points of headwinds for expenses. So we expect overall fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year depending on equity market levels, with servicing and management fees up 7% to 8% as we anniversary a strong 2Q 2020 in FX trading and CRD. 
Regarding NII, Given the impact of historically low short-end rates as well as the impact of long-end rates in our investment portfolio, we now expect NII to run around $460 million to $465 million per quarter from here in 2021, assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate. 
Turning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses, ex notable items, will be up around 2.5% year-over-year or relatively flat ex currency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenue-related costs. 
On taxes, we expect that the 2Q '21 tax rate will be towards the upper end of our full year range of 17% to 19%. While it is still early in the year, we are taking up our full year fee revenue guide again, and now expect full year fee revenue to be up 2.5% to 4%. We also expect that slightly higher revenue-related variable costs will add about 50 basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down 1% ex notable items. Just remember, there's a solid point of FX translation in these full year fee and full year expense guides. 
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

And then taking a step back, it really sounds like momentum in front-to-back is progressing pretty nicely. So I was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call, sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that, Eric, you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing, new business, I think collectively, that added up to like maybe a low single-digit growth over time.

Let me start on the quarter and then we'll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that, which is currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4%, and you know there's always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about a 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that, we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%. 
So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter, we had some of that, but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis. 
And then the other component is net new business. And as I've said, I think, pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters in the -- over the last 4 to 6 quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we'll be in a position to have net new business growth. For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay, but not enough and not at the levels that we'd like to be. And that's, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We've been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You've heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results, as I highlighted and asset managers, for example, an alternatives. And that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods."

We're on the capital return plan, that's largely driven by our common equity tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter, but are still solidly above, I think, or we'll return solidly above where we -- the range. So we've got confidence in what we can do there. 
On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we'd like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some -- a little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some  ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last 2-year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range, so there's some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet. 
I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we're the right way around. And right now, it's right-way risk, so to speak, because it's clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand. That's pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or 2, if necessary. And so part of what we're very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of Fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that in -- during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity."

First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through, and then we've got to take a full year look. So I'll just be a little cautious on that. 
I think, more broadly, in terms of ROE is absolutely a focus. I think you've seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE as a management -- has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we're incredibly focused on those 3 major leverage points. And I've got to tell you, I've got entire management team who's thinking about those every month and every quarter. I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we're just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you've seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and then -- and filter back into ROE and every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there's real, I think, flow-through there. 
And then I think the second one is, you hinted, is around capital return. We're very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year in line with this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the Fed limits. We've done that again in the second quarter. And we're committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there's a path in that way as well."

Glenn, it's Eric. I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don't have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I take some -- I think that's some context to help with. 
The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short-end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to 1-month and 3-month treasuries. And effectively, as 1- and 3-month treasuries fell from kind of 8, 9 basis points down to 3, 4 and 5 basis points in March, you're starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the -- -- against the management fee -- against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 or 5 basis point move at the front end does have the impact as you've seen. 
I think the good news here is we've continued to see cash inflows into our complex. Part of that comes from the easing and the monetary policy that we're seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I'll tell you that that's all been factored into our guide and part of what we're managing through."

The way -- I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we'll now have 3 months worth of that in the second quarter, so that's what drives the  additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen. 
Long-end rates. Long-end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down. And now, even at this current level, are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII. What has started to work against the long-end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down, and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII. And so you're kind of having this continued headwind from long-end rates, which will -- which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is in -- is about 3 years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there's another year of long-end rates being a headwind. What we're now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models. And that starts to create a partial offset to those long-end rate headwinds. And what we're looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long-end rates will still be a headwind, but premiumization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those 2 will be roughly neutral. 
And that's effectively why we don't see an uptick because that long-end rate headwind just continues on effectively for the -- for that 2- to 3-year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don't see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I'm trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we'll know more in the coming couple of quarters."

There's -- I think it's fair to say that there's the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here. And that's clearly on the minds of regulators, and there's clearly lots of applications in front of them. But right now, that's part of the gating factor. But we would view this as a trend that's here to stay. And I think it's a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form, not just traditional currency but administration. How do you think about in the context of an ETF? What does crypto basket creation look like? 
But then there's the other side of this, it's crypto assets, and we're very active in thinking about how do we move from custody, something that's physical or near physical to custodying a token. And what does that mean for us. So it's a very, very important part of our R&D, and it's a very, very important part of our share online now."

I think we're also very conscious of where is the white space, where are there near-term opportunities. And we think ETF, crypto ETF is an important one. Why? because it takes something that is a bit on the side, a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream. It makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions. It increases access. And so we're very active and you saw 1 announcement. We've got a strong pipeline of clients because these are, by and large, our clients who are innovating in crypto ETF. And while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage, they all need record keepers and administrators, right? 
The core of this is the credibility that we could bring. And we think that's a real area of white space where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces."

And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that. 
We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here. 
It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that. But it does need to have -- there's a certain capacity that we can run.

We would have printed 10.2%, 10.3% if they hadn't flowed through. And I mentioned those because, in fact, that's why we have buffers. That's why we have ranges. It's kind of part of what we need to operate around and always flag if they come in a little heftier which might occasionally push ratios down a bit or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that's fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion on the base of our balance sheet, that adds 0.25 point of the CET1 impact. 
And then the other one is the FX book just by nature of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last 2 weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we'll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it's reversed since"

Is there anything specific going on? Does your outlook assume a normalization in the volume-driven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate?

Brennan, I think the biggest thing that's happening right now is that as AUCA's rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it's not a point for point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUCA effectively drives a -- if it's driven by equity markets, a 3-point increase in servicing fees, right? It's that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It's not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUCA and servicing fees. So I think that's the biggest item that plays through. If we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years. And you'll see that for the rest of the year. So I'd just be very careful about that just mathematical result. 
I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There'll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that's still a very healthy growth rate. A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that's part of our business model. That's always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it's part. And when they're going up, it's part. So that's the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we're at, we've got a strong of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year."

Short rates are they matter to you all and It seems like that's what's holding back some of the more constructive dynamics we're seeing at the long end of the curve.

So was there something that happened behind the scenes that maybe we weren't aware of that could have had the outlook maybe take a little off of the outlook or make it a little bit less constructive?"

I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we've seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we're going to have 1-month and 3-month treasuries sit at 4 basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they've clearly sat here or been weighted down. So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q, so that's not a -- I think that's not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we'll have some upside, but that's real. 
And then the other one that we're, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you've seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think most of that was modeled then by folks. But it's hopefully the last gas on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we're in burnout mode. 
But I think that slight 1 month that I'm fairly confident will be 1 month, it will be a -- and it's industry-wide, it's in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it's just a reminder that we don't -- aren't sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I'll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we're confident in the stabilization now. But I'd love to see better than stabilization. We're just not quite at that point yet."

And clearly, we're in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we're in a new era again. 
I think our general view is that the pots of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury's own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we've seen that again this year. I think we do expect continued expansion because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we're trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we'd like to do that every day of the week because that's important to them. And we've got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It's not infinite capacity, but we've got some capacity. 
And then what we'll have to do is if the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they're going to -- when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We've got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at 0 or near 0. So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That's not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It's -- but it's in a year or 2 that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we'll have to just navigate through.

And given what we know today, so we think that we're there, we're confident we're there. And now the question is how long is it flattish at that level? And then when does it pick up in that? I think we'll know more in the coming quarters. 
And on the fee waivers, what we've done is forecasted what they'd be for second quarter, the net 40-ish or so offset by balances versus the net 15-or-so from first quarter. But that's predicated on short rates being where they are today, and they've been kind of flattish the last 30, 45 days, and -- but that's the assumption. We're obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up, that's supposed to go the other way. And so it's just based on that."

Part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It's not to say that they don't need customization, but we're -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we've been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities. But at the same time, we've recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they're receiving the appropriate amount of service, but at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we're delivering expected service that we're doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we've talked to you about this on a new problem. 
And at the same time, what we also want to be able to do is there's many firms at that median level, that either through their sophistication through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricing was a bit of a higher service model. So a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket, if you will, and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that they're not underserved and they're not overserved."

And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or an MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we're on to make that trade at the right levels of higher rates, you get the benefit if rates were to come down off a positive AOCI, so that's helpful.

Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we are operating in today compared to this time last year,",1269,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we are operating in today compared to this time last year, and then highlight some of the data that evidents the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise, all the while being an essential partner for our clients.
Relative to the first quarter of 2020, the first 3 months of 2021 could hardly be more different. Economic activity is sharply rebounding, unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in 2020. Although short-end rates remain at historically low levels, long-end U.S. bond yields are rebounding.
While COVID-19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world, there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. The owners and managers of the world's capital are also looking to the future and to the next stage of growth. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow, we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions.
As demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, State Street continues to successfully navigate the improving operating environment. Although, as I noted, short-term interest rates, which compressed further during the first quarter, remain a critical headwind for our industry. While we cannot control interest rates, we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsource solutions provider, underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our State Street Alpha front-to-back platform. And we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons.
First, we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis, and our clients know that they can depend on the world of the services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad.
Second, throughout the crisis, we continue to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model, client service and operational resiliency, which has been apparent to and noted by our clients.
Third, many clients are reassessing their own operating models. And as a result, we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities, allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients.
Fourth, our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines. I am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service.
Last, both our Alpha and non-Alpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take-up as demonstrated by some recent announcements. For example, we reported an additional 3 State Street Alpha clients during the first quarter. And separately, this morning, we announced a full front-to-back Alpha relationship with Invesco, adding front and middle office services to our existing back office mandates.
Through the open architecture nature of our operating platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships, unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our Alpha value proposition, which is appealing to clients. After quarter end, we announced that M&G has appointed us to provide outsourced middle office services in addition to our existing fund accounting and custody services. State Street will administer the middle office services on Aladdin, exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their front-end and middle office systems.
These deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win front-to-back mandates as well as to win new business as a result of the interoperable nature of our operating platform. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy, we also continue to innovate across our franchise. For example, our growing demand exists for ESG solutions that will provide the necessary data, risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale. To that end, during the first quarter, we introduced enhancements to our ESG solutions and can now provide clients with the ability to address new global ESG regulatory requirements for a single platform.
Global Advisors, a new U.S. corporate ESG ETF, launched in EMEA in late 2020 and grew to $5.4 billion of AUM by the end of the first quarter, making it the largest corporate bond ESG fund in the UCITS space.
We also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing [ digital ] products. We recently announced our intention to service the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF. Subject to regulatory approval, we will work with VanEck to provide services, including ETF basket operations, custody of the ETF shares, fund accounting, order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions.
Next, I will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.
Turning to Slide 3, first quarter EPS was $1.37, or $1.47 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter total revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, total fee revenue increased 4%, driven by servicing and management fee growth, which increased 7% and 6% year-over-year, respectively, as well as an improved software and processing fee performance. Collectively, these more than offset the year-over-year headwind from FX trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year. While our FX trading revenues are down year-over-year, first quarter revenue remains well above pre-pandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent [ in recent years ].
Even with rising total fee revenue, first quarter total expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off. Furthermore, we have successfully reduced high-cost location headcount relative to the period 1 year ago. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of 2021.
At the end of the first quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels, supported by higher period end markets. AUC/A increased to $40.3 trillion. New asset servicing wins were a solid $343 billion, while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Global Advisors' AUM increased to $3.6 trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in ETFs and a solid performance in the cash business. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 14% to $225 million, and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling our Alpha strategy. Overall, we had a strong start to the year, and we remain confident that we have a clear path for our medium-term targets as we discussed in January.
To conclude, we continue to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid improving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results. We remain focused on partly developing and growing our Alpha offering, and I'm pleased with the recent client activities. Meanwhile, we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise.
During the first quarter, we returned $659 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends. For the second quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases, consistent with the limits set by the Fed.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."

We reported EPS of $1.37, or $1.47 excluding the impact of notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on th",2408,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.37, or $1.47 excluding the impact of notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide.
On the left of the slide, you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth, while expenses were well controlled despite higher market values and client volumes. As a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the year ago period, we also show our first quarter results, excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-over-year or up 2%, excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic. For context, total fee revenue, excluding FX trading services, was up 9% year-on-year, or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with strong mid-single-digit growth in servicing fees, management fees and securities finance.
Expenses were roughly flat year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. So in total, this was a solid quarter, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model as we drive towards growth.
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see strong business volume growth across the franchise. Period-end AUC/A increased 26% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $40 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period-end market levels, client flows and net new business growth. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased the result of higher period end equity market levels, better client flows and net new business which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets. We're seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines, and we're seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now custody.
At Global Advisors, AUM increased 34% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.6 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net ETF and cash inflows. Our ETF franchise had a strong flow performance again as the U.S. ETF industry experienced record flows. Spider net inflows amounted to over $23 billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low cost doing particularly well.
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were also up 5% quarter-on-quarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity. This quarter, we saw good growth in asset managers, alternatives and official institutions.
I'm pleased with how 2021 has started as the first quarter AUC/A wins totaled a solid $343 billion, which is up from recent quarters. And for context, last quarter, you heard me outline that we need approximately $1.5 billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth, which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business.
I'm also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broad-based growth across our clients, segments and regions. As an example, you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter, we announced that we have assumed the depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo in Europe. AUC/A won but yet to be installed amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Positively, both our reported wins and to-be-installed numbers exclude the 2 recently announced mandates, which Ron mentioned just a moment ago, as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Let me discuss several other important fee revenue lines in more detail. First quarter management fees were $493 million, up 6% year-on-year, including a 2% impact from currency translation, but were flat quarter-on-quarter. Both our year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our ETF and cash businesses, partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers.
Regarding money market fee waivers, we had about $15 million this quarter, and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in short-end rates in March. If they persist, we expect company-wide impact to be around $50 million to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in 2Q and of distribution fees, though higher balances should be worth roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter, leaving the net impact closer to $40 million per quarter.
FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the exceptional first quarter of 2020, FX trading revenue fell 22% year-on-year, but it was up 7% quarter-on-quarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs. While FX market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher client volumes as our FX business continue to benefit from many years of investment across 6 venues and now 47 markets, 3 of which we added and 2 of which we expanded in the last year alone.
Our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth, increasing 8% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program. Finally, our first quarter software and processing fees were up 55% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter largely due to changes in mark-to-market adjustments.
Moving to Slide 8, we have here CRD stand-alone revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into 3 categories to help see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for on-premise revenue. Total CRD revenues increased 4% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher software-enabled revenue and was 10% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely due to seasonally higher on-premise revenues in the fourth quarter. As shown on this slide, the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues increased by a strong 21% combined growth rate relative to the year ago period.
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the first quarter highlights of State Street Alpha. We reported an additional 3 Alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base, and this doesn't include this morning's first quarter and quarter end announcement. The Alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the Alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure.
Turning to Slide 9. First quarter NII declined 30% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of a $20 million market-related benefits in the first quarter of 2020. Quarter-on-quarter, NII declined 6% as expected. Around 3% of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower long-end rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarter's downdraft in short-end rates on our sponsored member repo activity, and the rest was due to the lumpier items, including day count. These impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances, as you can see on the right of the slide.
Total average deposits increased by $20 billion in the first quarter or an increase of 10% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy. We remain mindful of OCI risk to our capital. So as the U.S. Treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter, we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates.
Turning to Slide 10, we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are clearly evident. Excluding notable items, first quarter expenses increased 2% year-on-year, which is all driven by the weaker dollar, which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat year-on-year. On a line item basis, compensation employee benefits was up only 1%, excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. Information systems and communication expenses were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate.
Transaction processing expenses were up just 1% ex FX as our savings initiatives offset significant volume-based growth in subcustody and market data costs. Occupancy and other expenses were both down several points. Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation.
Overall, I'm pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately $15 million of variable revenue-related costs. We continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation, reengineering and scale.
Moving to Slide 11, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year, but fell 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 10.8%. Relative to the fourth quarter, our capital base was impacted by lower AOCI as a result of the significant run-up in long-end U.S. Treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced lift-up deal we completed with Intesa Sanpaolo.
We also saw a $6 billion increase in episodic RWA, primarily related to FX trading and overdraft activity. This RWA headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by $5 billion. So at the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio will be over 11%, all else being equal. Tier 1 leverage was down year-over-year and fell by 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%, primarily as a result of higher average assets, driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the AOCI change and the $500 million partial call for Series F preferred securities announced in January.
As you can see on the slide, and as I mentioned previously, we continue to consider a CET1 target range of 10% to 11% as appropriate level of capital for our business. Further, we consider that a Tier 1 leverage ratio between 5.25% and 5.75% as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits.
Last, as we look ahead and as Ron noted, for the second quarter of 2020, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases, consistent with the limit set by the Fed.
Turning to Slide 12, we provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise.
Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-on-year, including the significant year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year. And excluding FX trading services, total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation, with solid mid-single-digit growth across servicing fees, management fees and sec lending. And with that strong top line fee growth, expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.
Next, I would like to update our full year economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our full year interest rate outlook assumes that short-end rates remain pressured, and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve, in line with the current forwards, which suggests modestly improving premium amortization, so the pace of improvement remains uncertain. We're also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year, or up around 10% point-to-point from the beginning of 2021 as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility.
In terms of the second quarter of 2021, our guide includes about 2 percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and 2 percentage points of headwinds for expenses. So we expect overall fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year depending on equity market levels, with servicing and management fees up 7% to 8% as we anniversary a strong 2Q 2020 in FX trading and CRD. Regarding NII, Given the impact of historically low short-end rates as well as the impact of long-end rates in our investment portfolio, we now expect NII to run around $460 million to $465 million per quarter from here in 2021, assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate.
Turning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses, ex notable items, will be up around 2.5% year-over-year or relatively flat ex currency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenue-related costs.
On taxes, we expect that the 2Q '21 tax rate will be towards the upper end of our full year range of 17% to 19%. While it is still early in the year, we are taking up our full year fee revenue guide again, and now expect full year fee revenue to be up 2.5% to 4%. We also expect that slightly higher revenue-related variable costs will add about 50 basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down 1% ex notable items. Just remember, there's a solid point of FX translation in these full year fee and full year expense guides.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

So ex currency translation, servicing fees were up about 4% sequentially. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how much was the market versus sort of -- and higher volumes versus more kind of organic trends in the quarter.
And then taking a step back, it really sounds like momentum in front to back is progressing pretty nicely. So I was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call, sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that, Eric, you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing, new business, I think collectively, that added up to like maybe a low single-digit growth over time. Kind of how does that feel to you guys now given some of the changes you've seen in the business?"

Let me start on the quarter and then we'll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that, which is currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4%, and you know there's always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about a 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that, we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%.
So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter, we had some of that, but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis.
And then the other component is net new business. And as I've said, I think, pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters in the -- over the last 4 to 6 quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we'll be in a position to have net new business growth.
For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay, but not enough and not at the levels that we'd like to be. And that's, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We've been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You've heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results, as I highlighted in asset managers, for example, in alternatives. And that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods."

Clearly, the -- we're pleased with the progress with Alpha 3 reported wins in the first quarter. And as we noted, one that we reported already for the second quarter, about 1/3 of our business to be installed, the $463 billion to be installed is Alpha-related. And we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that we've talked about.
What that means, though, is these are longer installations, right? We're, remember, in effect, we're becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients. So it will be nice revenue impact, but we're talking about 2022 and 2023 revenue impact, relatively, little of that, certainly of the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in 2021."

We're on the capital return plan, that's largely driven by our common equity tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter, but are still solidly above, I think, or we'll return solidly above where we -- the range. So we've got confidence in what we can do there.
On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we'd like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some -- a little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last 2-year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range. So there's some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet.
I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we're the right way around. And right now, it's right-way risk, so to speak, because it's clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand that's pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or 2, if necessary. And so part of what we're very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of Fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that in -- during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity."

First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through, and then we've got to take a full year look. So I'll just be a little cautious on that.
I think, more broadly, in terms of ROE is absolutely a focus. I think you've seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE as a management -- has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we're incredibly focused on those 3 major leverage points. And I've got to tell you, I've got entire management team who's thinking about those every month and every quarter.
I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we're just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you've seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and then -- and filter back into ROE. And every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there's real, I think, flow-through there.
And then I think the second one is, you hinted, is around capital return. We're very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year in line with this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the Fed limits. We've done that again in the second quarter. And we're committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there's a path in that way as well."

Glenn, it's Eric. I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don't have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I take some -- I think that's some context to help with.
The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short-end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to 1-month and 3-month treasuries. And effectively, as 1- and 3-month treasuries fell from kind of 8, 9 basis points down to 3, 4 and 5 basis points in March, you're starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 or 5 basis point move at the front end does have the impact as you've seen.
I think the good news here is we've continued to see cash inflows into our complex. Part of that comes from the easing and the monetary policy that we're seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I'll tell you that that's all been factored into our guide and part of what we're managing through."

The way -- I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we'll now have 3 months' worth of that in the second quarter, so that's what drives the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen.
On long-end rates, long-end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down. And now, even at this current level, are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII, but has started to work against the long-end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down, and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII.
And so you're kind of having this continued headwind from long-end rates, which will -- which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is in -- is about 3 years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there's another year of long-end rates being a headwind.
What we're now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models. And that starts to create a partial offset to those long-end rate headwinds. And what we're looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long-end rates will still be a headwind, but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those 2 will be roughly neutral.
And that's effectively why we don't see an uptick because that long-end rate headwind just continues on effectively for the -- for that 2- to 3-year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don't see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I'm trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we'll know more in the coming couple of quarters."

And then I think you were doing the -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you were doing most of the custody fund accounting for Invesco. So this, optically, would be an add-on in revenue, but your custody base wouldn't change so much.

And I think I've been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often, but not always. Accounting, middle office, Charles River takes time. And the larger the installations, the more time it takes.

And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that.
We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here.
It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that.

We would have printed 10.2% or 10.3% if they hadn't flowed through. And I mentioned those because, in fact, that's why we have buffers. That's why we have ranges. It's kind of part of what we need to operate around and always flag if they come in a little heftier, which might occasionally push ratios down a bit; or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that's fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up, and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion. On the base of our balance sheet, that adds 0.25 point of the CET1 impact.
And then the other one is the FX book just by nature of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last 2 weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we'll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it's reversed since."

It seems as though there's a decent amount of B-rate compression or the relationship of AUC and AUM to revenues seems to be with revenues lagging given the outlook here. And when you look at the full year, it almost suggests as though that will remain intact for the rest of the year.
Is there anything specific going on? Does your outlook assume a normalization in the volume-driven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate? Or is there some mix going on that's adverse? If there's any additional color you can give, that would be really helpful."

Brennan, I think the biggest thing that's happening right now is that as AUC/As rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it's not a point-for-point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUC/A effectively drives a -- if it's driven by equity markets, a 3-point increase in servicing fees, right? It's that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It's not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUC/A and servicing fees.
So I think that's the biggest item that plays through if we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years. And you'll see that for the rest of the year. So I'd just be very careful about that just mathematical result.
I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There'll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that's still a very healthy growth rate.
A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that's part of our business model. That's always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it's part. And when they're going up, it's part. So that's the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we're at, we've got a strong set of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year."

I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we've seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we're going to have 1-month and 3-month treasuries sit at 4 basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they've clearly sat here or been weighted down.
So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q. So that's not a -- I think that's not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we'll have some upside, but that's real.
And then the other one that we're, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you've seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think most of that was modeled then by folks. But it's hopefully the last gasp on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we're in burnout mode.
But I think that slight 1 month that I'm fairly confident will be 1 month, it will be a -- and it's industry-wide, it's in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it's just a reminder that we don't -- aren't sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I'll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we're confident in the stabilization now.

Can you share with us how are you guys calibrating what kind of deposit growth you're likely to see as the Fed continues with QE for the remainder of this year and into next year?"

I think that's the $64,000 question that many banks are wrestling with, especially as some of the rule changes happen for others on SLR and as we think about the leverage ratios. And clearly, we're in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we're in a new era again.
I think our general view is that the parts of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury's own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we've seen that again this year.
I think we do expect continued expansion. Because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we're trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we'd like to do that every day of the week because that's important to them. And we've got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It's not infinite capacity, but we've got some capacity.
And then what we'll have to do is if the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities, slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We've got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at 0 or near 0.
So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That's not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It's -- but it's in a year or 2 that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we'll have to just navigate through. We feel pretty comfortable where we are today and in the next quarter or 2. But we'll just have to see if there's a wave, we'll address, and I think we'll just have to navigate through."

Part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It's not to say that they don't need customization, but we're -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we've been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities.
But at the same time, we've recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they're receiving the appropriate amount of service, but at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we're delivering expected service that we're doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we've talked to you about this on a new problem.

And so it's actually a mix of a higher curve in the belly of the curve that would be good to see. And right now, 5s are in the, whatever, 85, 90 basis point range. It'd be nice to see them a good bit higher. And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or in MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we want to make that trade.

But we're not at that level where we -- everything great is going to come back down very quickly. And so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade.

Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the mul",1194,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider. 
I am particularly pleased with our results, as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history. We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth, with servicing fees at the highest level in 3 years, propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness. We continue to differentiate State Street through our unique product and operational capabilities as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality. Our pipeline continues to deliver, as evidenced by another strong -- another quarter of strong servicing and Alpha client mandates, which I will discuss shortly. 
Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation. For example, we announced the formation of State Street Digital in the second quarter, a new division focused on addressing the industry's evolving shift to digital finance, both as product offerings and as a business model. This is just one example in a long history of innovation that State Street has and is continuing to drive within our industry. We also continue to develop State Street Alpha, our front-to-back offering. This unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities, which I will also discuss shortly. 
Turning to Slide 3, I will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Second quarter EPS was $2.07 or $1.97 excluding notable items. Despite the impact of our -- of interest rates on our NII, earnings per share ex notables reached the highest level since 4Q '19 when quarterly NII was notably higher, more than 35% more than it was in 2Q '21. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, increasing 6% year-over-year, driven by solid servicing and management fee growth, which increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, as well as better securities finance results. This strong performance was partially offset by the year-over-year impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees, continued moderation of FX market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds. 
Even with record quarterly fee revenue, expenses were well controlled, while second quarter total expenses were up 1% relative to the year ago period, they were down almost 0.5 percentage point year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation, as our productivity improvements continue to yield results. We have created a culture of expense discipline over the last 2.5 years and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of 2021. 
Our strong fee revenue performance, coupled with continued cost discipline, delivered a 200 basis point improvement toward pretax margin year-over-year, which reached nearly 30% in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Further, return on equity was 12.6% or 11.9%, excluding notable items in the second quarter. AUC/A increased to a record $42.6 trillion at quarter end, supported by higher period end equity market levels and new business onboardings. New asset servicing wins increased to $1.2 trillion for the quarter, including the large Alpha mandate with Invesco announced in April. 
We reported 2 new Alpha wins in the second quarter, taking the total number of Alpha clients to 15. After the second quarter close, we also entered into an Alpha mandate with Legal & General. While Invesco is an example of how Alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships, the Legal & General win demonstrates how the Alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the world's most sophisticated investors. Our experience to date gives us confidence that Alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients, while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates. Additionally, we are signing Alpha clients that are new to State Street, demonstrating that Alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front, middle and back office services in a differentiated manner. 
We also created new relationships to help drive revenue growth across client segments and regions. For example, earlier this week, we announced a new strategic alliance with First Abu Dhabi Bank. The alliance will create a full-service enterprise offering for institutional investors in the Middle East and North Africa region. It will provide investors with extensive reach into more than 100 markets around the world. Clients will have access to State Street's full suite of front, middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions, which seamlessly integrates with First Abu Dhabi Bank's regional suite of security services products, local expertise and regional direct custody network. 
At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $230 million, and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling and propelling our Alpha strategy. Global Advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance. AUM increased to $3.9 trillion and management fees increased to $504 million, both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of $83 billion across the ETF, institutional and cash businesses as we continue the leverage -- to leverage the strength of our asset management franchise. 
In ETFs, our low-cost and sector funds as well as our ESG and commodity products continue to enjoy good market share, with low-cost ETFs expanding share in the second quarter. And in institutional, our sales force and relationship management realignment, coupled with a strong product set led to good revenue growth. 
Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we returned over $600 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, inclusive of $425 million of common share repurchases consistent with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. I am pleased with yet another strong performance under this year's annual stress test. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital base. As examples, yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase of our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion during the third quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022. 
To conclude, we had a very strong quarter. Business momentum is building, and we have demonstrated meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets. As I look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets, we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth while controlling costs by transforming the way we work in building a higher-performing organization for the future. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."
188785,718779759,2347180,"State Street Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2021",2021-07-16,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impact of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of the majo",2219,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impact of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of the majority stake in the legacy business. On the left panel of the slide, you can see strong results as we continue to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses, we delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth. As a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period, we continue to show our year-on-year results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column. We also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide. 
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see our business volume growth. Period end, AUC/A increased 27% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $42.6 trillion. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 28% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to $3.9 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net inflows. 
Turning to Slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Second quarter servicing fees increased 10% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels, positive net new business onboarded and client flows, only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prior year client activity. AUC/A wins totaled $1.2 trillion in the second quarter, substantially up from recent quarters, primarily as a result of the large Alpha client mandate announced last April that Ron just mentioned. AUC/A won but yet to be installed also amounted to $1.2 trillion at quarter end as we smoothly onboarded over $400 billion of client assets this past quarter. 
We remain focused on reigniting business growth across both client segments and regions. This quarter, we had strong growth in the EMEA region, aided by our intense coverage efforts, which now extend to approximately 350 overall of our top clients. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, and we've clearly exceeded that mark this year. I will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. At this time, we expect the current won but yet to be installed AUC/A will be converted over the coming 12- to 24-month time period, with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022 and the majority occurring in 2023. As we said in June, we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum. 
Turning to Slide 7, second quarter management fees reached a record $504 million, up 14% year-on-year, inclusive of 2 percentage point impact from currency translation and were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pretax margin approaching 35%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation as well as about $25 million of money market fee waivers this quarter. 
While we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $35 million per quarter as a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates following the June FOMC meeting, we now expect that they will be about $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the rest of the year, which is about 1/3 lower than we had previously expected. Global Advisors recorded solid flows across institutional ETF and cash for the quarter, with the total amount amounting to $83 billion. We have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, which are driving this momentum, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. 
Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remain above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Relative to a strong second quarter in 2020, FX revenue fell 12% year-on-year as declining FX market volatility compared to the COVID environment last year more than offset higher client volumes. FX revenue was down 17% quarter-on-quarter, driven by a moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility.  
Our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth, with fees increasing 18% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody and agency balances as client leverage rebounded. Finally, second quarter software and processing fees were down 12% year-on-year, largely due to the absence of prior year positive mark-to-market adjustments. Software and processing fees increased 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher CRD revenues. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'd like to provide some further updates on our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD results in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 10% year-on-year, resulting in an increase in stand-alone annualized recurring revenue to $230 million. This quarter marks the 3-year anniversary since announcing the CRD acquisition, and we're very pleased with how the business has performed. We're winning in part, thanks to State Street's brand and reputation and the benefit to clients of our integrated Alpha offering. 
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the second quarter highlights from State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 2 new Alpha mandates during the second quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through the second quarter, we now have 5 Alpha client mandates that are live. Although Alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement, given the size and scope, the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share of wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract lengths, which can be up to 10 years in length for Alpha services that span the front and middle office. 
Turning to Slide 10, second quarter NII declined 16% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment on our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo product. These impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion, driven by higher balances. Relative to the first quarter, however, NII was flat as lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of short-end rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity. On the right side of the slide, we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Total average deposits increased by $16 billion in the second quarter or an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy. 
While we continue to remain mindful of OCI risk in the current rate environment, we tactically added about $5 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago before the recent downdraft in rates. We also increased our average loan balances by approximately 5% quarter-on-quarter to over $29 billion, driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call client. We also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptake that we saw during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11, second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by the weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation, total expenses were down nearly 0.5 percentage point year-on-year as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue-related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs compared to 2Q '20 on a line item basis and excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation, compensation and employee benefit cost was flat as we reduced high-cost location headcount, which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. 
Information Systems and Communications were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing was up 10%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses for sub custody balances and market data costs. Occupancy was down 13%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits. And other expenses were down 11%, primarily driven by lower than usual professional services fees. Relative to the first quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter. So overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline as we have effectively managed total expenses ex-notables and currency, down year-on-year in the second quarter, while driving strong total fee revenue growth. 
Moving to Slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased with our performance under this year's CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at that floor. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our capital base in a number of different ways, including investment opportunities, dividends and buybacks. For example, yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share, and our Board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion from the third quarter of 2021 through year-end 2022. In addition, we're also pleased that the Federal Reserve has provided State Street with 1 additional year until January 1, 2024, to retain its current GCIB surcharge of 1%.
To the left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 11.2% as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation, and we also managed down RWAs despite balance sheet growth. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum, but declined by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 5.2%, primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the Fed's quantitative easing continues. We continue to think that a Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 5s as appropriate for our business model, and we can operate at the lower end of this range for a number of quarters while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives. 
Turning to Slide 13. In summary, our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our top line and the scale we are driving within our operating model. Total fee revenue was up almost 6% year-on-year and exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, with double-digit growth in servicing and management fees despite the year-on-year headwind from the strong FX trading services result we had in the second quarter of last year during COVID. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result of our productivity program. As a result, we are able to drive pretax margin and ROE close to our medium-term targets, notwithstanding the low rate environment. 
Next, I'd like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook. At a macro level, our rate view broadly aligns the current forward rate curve and assumes that short-end rates remain low and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve. We are also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market activity. 
In terms of the third quarter of 2021, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 7% to 8% year-over-year, with servicing and management fees each expected to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. This means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided. Regarding NII, despite the recent flattening of the yield curve, we have seen an increase in short-end market rates, and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the rest of the year, assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate. 
Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs. We expect that third quarter expenses, ex-notable items, will be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 percentage point year-over-year in 3Q. These fee and expense guides for 3Q include approximately 1 point of currency translation year-over-year. On taxes, we expect that the 3Q '21 tax rate will be in the middle of our full year range of 17% to 19%. 
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

I mean, they -- we think of the business as having 3 core elements to it, the ETF business, the institutional business and the cash business. And both are well-established franchises. The areas that we'd like to lean into are the institutional business first, and I'll come back to the ETF business. But the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world, but a limited product set. So what we've spent a lot of time thinking about is how do we take those relationships in that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities. 
On the ETF side, we have been on a long path to developing the product set there as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the U.S. You've seen a lot of payoff from that, particularly in EMEA. We'll continue to grow that. Areas of growth include ESG, which for us continues to do very nicely as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core products. It was -- it's an institutionally designed product set. It has a lot of liquidity to it. And liquidity is important to many investors. So it's emphasizing what we have there.

I think we're seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses, in addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets. And I think it's a combination of both, equity markets were up globally quarter-on-quarter 5%. So that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses. But in addition, I think what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues. Last quarter, I said we were relatively neutral net new business and servicing fees. This quarter, we're nicely positive on that front on the servicing fee side. 
In management fees, we've been booking a couple of quarters here in a row of very nice inflows. They've come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well. And then you saw we've had good performance across our SEC lending franchise. CRD had another good quarter. And so we're comfortable with a higher guide. I think I gave you primarily third quarter information, and then maybe just to try to answer the question directly, the full year fee guide, if you recall, was taken up last quarter to 2.5% to 4% year-over-year, remember that includes lapping ourselves from the COVID bump from FX a year ago. So our guide had been 2.5% to 4% for total fee growth. And I think now you can count on around 5% growth. So we're going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being, given what we know today."

And what you've seen us do is we've try to put some of the additional deposits to work. You've seen us take advantage of the increase in IOER and the Fed floor on repo rates, so that's been constructive. We do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet, because as we compress the balance sheet that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital, and so we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits. We had more of an uptick in May and June. April has kind of been roughly in line with the first quarter. And so we're starting to chip away at that, and we see a path to do that. 
I don't think that will have much of an effect on NII. Remember at these low rates, deposits, when you -- the incremental deposit is worth a little bit, but not a lot. But it will be the right way to manage the balance of NII, which I think will comfortably sit in that new range that we provided, while also freeing up space for capital return, which is an important priority for us."

It's really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates. And so we saw some larger deals this quarter. And because it's the denominator of assets is larger, will come a little lighter in terms of fee rate. On the other hand, in first quarter, we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate. 
And so you kind of have a number of combinations and what we're always doing is on a profitability basis on an incremental basis, always making sure that as we add revenues, we do it at healthy margins. We use it as a way to control our costs and be disciplined. And so I think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next, but we're actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year is well in line with our overall fee rate for the company. And that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins."

There are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time in place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what's possible and what we'd like to do, knowing that there's always -- that they always have to manage to the -- individually to the quarters, but the SCB does give us some flexibility. So let me do it in the following way. 
One of the things we start with is what is our CET1 ratio, and you saw we put in 11.2%. The first thing you can do is compare that to what's the target range, 10% to 11%. You can say, look, first step is how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range. And that provides $700 million, $800 million of capital return capacity. So that's one piece. 
Secondly, you go through earnings, earnings next quarter, the quarter after, you guys all have projections of earnings. And what we do with those earnings is say how do we give those earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return. So one part of that is the dividend. And then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks. That's an intention we often have. So you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters that we gave you, kind of a 6-quarter view. 
And then finally, the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit, not at the same intensity that a lending-oriented bank does, but our balance sheet might grow risk-weighted assets by 5%. So there's kind of a -- there's always a bit of capital retention that's necessary just to fund on a $120 billion of RWA, 5%, you always need to retain maybe $600 million typically in a year of capital to hold against that. So if you go through those pieces, it's literally down the floating down. It's the -- what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks. And then it's the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth, which I think pencils out to that up to $3 billion range."

Premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next, just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth. But what's happening is you've got the grind on the investment portfolio, which can be in the $15 million to $25 million range. And then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction. In the upcoming quarters, we're thinking it's in the $15 million range, but it will bounce around. And so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through, premium amortization going the other way. But it can bounce around plus/minus $5 million easily from one quarter to the next, and that's the kind of thing we just want to be careful of. 
What is nice is we're starting to get to a leveling off of the net yields on the portfolios, roll-offs are starting to get better matched with roll-ons. I think that's a good word to use, roll-off and roll-on of bonds. And so you saw that we printed net yield on the investment portfolio of about a 1.11%, 1.12%, we're pretty close to the bottom of that yield. And that's what gives us comfort that we're in this range for the time being, though, as you could see from my prepared remarks, we took the -- that -- the upper end of that range up a bit, just because of the improvement in front-end rates."

Let me touch on each of those because we're real pleased with the CRD performance, both in terms of this quarter's wins, the backlog, I think the momentum and obviously, how it contributes to the broader Straight Street whole. Just to take through the new bookings, $19 million for the quarter was a 5-quarter high. Some of that, I think you can easily ascribe to the Invesco win, which was front office, middle office, back office, as we continue to expand that relationship. And you'd have within the $19 million, the front office piece of that win. 
On the uninstalled backlog, the $93 million, it's a mix of installations that come over 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, in some cases, 24 months. What I will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees as you prepare and do those implementations, the classic -- in the classic software sense, those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts until you get to the go-live period, which in some cases, a short for smaller installations. In other cases, takes longer just given the size and complexity of what we're onboarding. 
And then I think, finally, you asked about the total revenues. The on-premise revenues were -- hit a high of another high, just like a year ago, coincidently of $63 million. Some of that was the classic re-upping of installations and that renew from 3-year-old contracts, 5-year-old contracts, that kind of stuff. I think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the $20 million to $25 million range. So I just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters over 5 quarters, 9 quarters, that kind of thing. And that will give you a better sense for what's typical in that on-premise line, but maybe that's enough to start with."

If you think about it, we've got an influx of deposits, they're held at the safest place in the world, the Fed and the central banks. And so we're not particularly exercised that bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range. So that's fine as long as we have over time that we can execute. And we do have those plans. That's what we do for a living. And as I mentioned, we've got actions in place. 
Some of those deposits came in a little heavier in May and June. We've got a set, for example, of ongoing client discussions of a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions, for example, around $10 billion of those that are literally happening, that have happened last week, this week. And so there are ways for us to chip away at that. 
In terms of the buyback patterning, while it's always dependent on facts and circumstances, and exactly what's going on at any point in time, we don't have an interest in backloading buybacks necessarily, like we'd rather do them relatively smoothly, again, all else being equal. And we think we have plenty of capacity, given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way, and in a way, I think that shareholders would appreciate."

On the NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the next couple of quarters, that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts.

Under the surface, there's always some amount of healthy growth in risk-weighted assets, right, because as we support our clients in the FX business or in the SEC lending business or by lending to them, we have to expand those modestly. Now on our balance sheet, we're a capital-light business. We've got a -- we have RWAs on our balance sheet that are in the $120 billion range. What -- I don't know, there's a range of what those can grow, but they're not growing at 10% a year. They may be growing 5-ish percent a year, plus/minus a couple of points. And so it's kind of that level. And when you grow RWAs, that amount, you're not really adding to the leverage balance sheet, the leverage balance sheet, which connects with Tier 1 leverage is driven primarily with deposits, and that's separable from the RWA kind of growth typically."

And the best way I can describe it is what's most pertinent to us as a institution, a bank holding company, is actually the bank LCR. The bank LCR is at 131%. So it's extremely flush, and it's got plenty of room. 
What happens at the corp is that the additional deposits get haircut just because of transferability, which is fine. And what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator, I'm happy to put you in touch with our IR team to share with you some of the scenarios, is that as we become more flush at the bank, which is a good thing, you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the LCR goes down. What's ironic is that if we were to begin to reduce deposits, what happens mathematically is that the bank LCR starts to flow down from this very elevated 131% and the corporate LCR actually floats up. And I think it's best to probably have, so when we work through the algebra with you, it's just how the rules are configured. They're fine.

We've gotten expenses down, ex-notables and adjusted for currency, down 2% and 1.5% last year and this year. What we've said is that on a nominal basis, we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 basis point range. And that's nominally and on an adjusted currency basis and notables, it would be down by about 1 point, obviously, with a range around that. 
And obviously, the biggest thing that we wrestle through this year, in particular, is that there are revenue-related costs that come through, as we've mentioned, some custody costs are often a UCA based, market data costs or a UCA or AUM base. And so those are what we're working through and why we have a range there. And we've stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today. 
I think the -- if I step back, the hallmark of our approach to cost is that you've got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit, but save a good amount of cost, right? And I think we show you typically when we do our January call, at the beginning of the year, that we're looking to take 4 or 5 percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs. We -- and that on a base of $8 billion, 4 or 5 points is that's significant amounts. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, but we're a scale business. That's what we should be doing. 
And at the same time, what we're doing is reinvesting a portion of that, not all of that, but a portion of that in the underlying business. And sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces. Sometimes, we reinvest by expanding and product feature functionality. Sometimes we invest as we onboard clients, right? We have some marginal cost that we have to have, and we're usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it. And so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest. And we'll continue to do that. 
Now how those balance out we've given you a sense of how that balances out to down expenses in '19, in 2020, it was down. And this year, we expect to be down as well, again, adjusted for notables and currency translation. How that plays out, we're going to keep working through. It's a little early to talk about next year. But I think you can tell we're pretty focused on this. But obviously, we do need to factor in revenue-related costs. And as equity market continue to tick upwards, we have to factor that in, and that's a little more of a feature this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been. And so that is something that we have to work through. But at least that's the broad approach."

And I said we were not as pleased as we'd like to be. We'd like it to be positive, and it's important for it to be positive. 
And part of what you're seeing is, I think that over the last couple of quarters, we've accelerated our wins and win rate. You see a little bit of that in AUC/As, but it's bouncy, right? You've seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases. So remember, custody can get installed quickly when it's won. And so we've had some focus on some of those kinds of wins and those have come through. And the intention here is how do you continue to sell and expand share of wallet with clients, not just with the top 60 as we've talked about, but the next 100 and the next 200.

That doesn't mean it will happen every quarter, but we're, I think, quite pleased with this quarter, and we see that it's been building.

I mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lower-cost locations, so you'd find that the mix has changed over that period. But you're raising actually the more important point, which is technology. 
And listen, service productivity -- and it's not just this service, and it's not just this firm, service productivity has been elusive for a long time now. And I think we, and I suspect others, are getting our arms around it. A lot of it is automation. A lot of it is taking -- and automation and services not the quite same thing as you envision an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms. It tends to be you're taking many, many tasks that constitute a job and automating those, such that what's remaining in the job is higher value-added and those things where you need judgment. We're getting better and better at instituting that. 
We also, Mike -- and we've talked about this in other context, we're spending a lot of time on measuring productivity. Again, manufacturers, the good ones have had this down for a long time, service companies, it's much newer. We've got a significant percentage of our company now that's covered by productivity metrics. And sometimes, it's the old Hawthorne effect, right? You just -- now that there's a measure and you're seeing, hey, there's a difference between this group and that group, and they're pretty similar in situating and doing the same thing, what can we learn from that? And that is starting to drive some of that productivity. 
On the technology side, I stand by the team that we have. It's an outstanding team. It's making a lot of progress. As you know, in technology, it's -- some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities, and that's part of the investment that we're making. A lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience. This is an ongoing issue for the industry, particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up. And as a G-SIFI, we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there. But I think we're making very good progress. It's showing up in the numbers.

That certainly is sustainable. I think the what we'd actually like to do, and you've seen in different quarters, if you go back to the last few earnings releases, is that the combination of professional services and software-enabled revenue is actually growing nicely in the double digits, not -- in some cases, closer to 15%. 
And because what's happening is two things. One is you've got take up in the market for new installations. And I think we've described in the past, the number of SaaS clients, for example, is up. But you also have, over time, conversion from on-premise to SaaS because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering, a more standardized cloud offering. It still has to connect with their -- the rest of their estate, where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis. So that's a -- that component of the professional services and software-enabled set of revenues in Charles River I think, are going to be in the mid -- in the double-digit teens typically. They'll just bounce around a little bit with professional services, but that's a real -- that's -- I think that's the future of the franchise is in those areas."

Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the mul",1194,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider.
I am particularly pleased with our results, as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history. We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth, with servicing fees at the highest level in 3 years, propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness. We continue to differentiate State Street through our unique product and operational capabilities as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality. Our pipeline continues to deliver, as evidenced by another strong -- another quarter of strong servicing and Alpha client mandates, which I will discuss shortly.
Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation. For example, we announced the formation of State Street Digital in the second quarter, a new division focused on addressing the industry's evolving shift to digital finance, both as product offerings and as a business model. This is just one example in a long history of innovation that State Street has and is continuing to drive within our industry.
We also continue to develop State Street Alpha, our front-to-back offering. This unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities, which I will also discuss shortly.
Turning to Slide 3. I will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Second quarter EPS was $2.07 or $1.97 excluding notable items. Despite the impact of our -- of interest rates on our NII, earnings per share ex notables reached the highest level since 4Q '19 when quarterly NII was notably higher, more than 35% more than it was in 2Q '21.
Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, increasing 6% year-over-year, driven by solid servicing and management fee growth, which increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, as well as better securities finance results. This strong performance was partially offset by the year-over-year impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees, continued moderation of FX market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds.
Even with record quarterly fee revenue, expenses were well controlled, while second quarter total expenses were up 1% relative to the year ago period, they were down almost 0.5 percentage point year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation, as our productivity improvements continue to yield results. We have created a culture of expense discipline over the last 2.5 years, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of 2021.
Our strong fee revenue performance, coupled with continued cost discipline, delivered a 200 basis point improvement toward pretax margin year-over-year, which reached nearly 30% in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Further, return on equity was 12.6% or 11.9%, excluding notable items in the second quarter.
AUC/A increased to a record $42.6 trillion at quarter end, supported by higher period end equity market levels and new business onboardings. New asset servicing wins increased to $1.2 trillion for the quarter, including the large Alpha mandate with Invesco announced in April.
We reported 2 new Alpha wins in the second quarter, taking the total number of Alpha clients to 15. After the second quarter close, we also entered into an Alpha mandate with Legal & General. While Invesco is an example of how Alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships, the Legal & General win demonstrates how the Alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the world's most sophisticated investors.
Our experience to date gives us confidence that Alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients, while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates. Additionally, we are signing Alpha clients that are new to State Street, demonstrating that Alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front, middle and back office services in a differentiated manner.
We also created new relationships to help drive revenue growth across client segments and regions. For example, earlier this week, we announced a new strategic alliance with First Abu Dhabi Bank. The alliance will create a full-service enterprise offering for institutional investors in the Middle East and North Africa region. It will provide investors with extensive reach into more than 100 markets around the world. Clients will have access to State Street's full suite of front, middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions, which seamlessly integrates with First Abu Dhabi Bank's regional suite of security services products, local expertise and regional direct custody network.
At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $230 million, and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling and propelling our Alpha strategy. Global Advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance. AUM increased to $3.9 trillion and management fees increased to $504 million, both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of $83 billion across the ETF, institutional and cash businesses as we continue the leverage -- to leverage the strength of our asset management franchise.
In ETFs, our low-cost and sector funds as well as our ESG and commodity products continue to enjoy good market share, with low-cost ETFs expanding share in the second quarter. And in institutional, our sales force and relationship management realignment, coupled with a strong product set led to good revenue growth.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital. We returned over $600 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, inclusive of $425 million of common share repurchases consistent with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. I am pleased with yet another strong performance under this year's annual stress test. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital base. As examples, yesterday, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase of our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion during the third quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022.
To conclude, we had a very strong quarter. Business momentum is building, and we have demonstrated meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets. As I look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets, we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth while controlling costs by transforming the way we work in building a higher-performing organization for the future.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."
188785,718779759,2347311,"State Street Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2021",2021-07-16,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impact of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of the majo",2220,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impact of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of the majority stake in the legacy business. On the left panel of the slide, you can see strong results as we continue to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses, we delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth. As a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period, we continue to show our year-on-year results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column. We also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide.
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see our business volume growth. Period end, AUC/A increased 27% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $42.6 trillion. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 28% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to $3.9 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net inflows.
Turning to Slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Second quarter servicing fees increased 10% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels, positive net new business onboarded and client flows, only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prior year client activity.
AUC/A wins totaled $1.2 trillion in the second quarter, substantially up from recent quarters, primarily as a result of the large Alpha client mandate announced last April that Ron just mentioned. AUC/A won but yet to be installed also amounted to $1.2 trillion at quarter end as we smoothly onboarded over $400 billion of client assets this past quarter.
We remain focused on reigniting business growth across both client segments and regions. This quarter, we had strong growth in the EMEA region, aided by our intense coverage efforts, which now extend to approximately 350 overall of our top clients. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, and we've clearly exceeded that mark this year. I will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. At this time, we expect the current won but yet to be installed AUC/A will be converted over the coming 12- to 24-month time period, with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022 and the majority occurring in 2023. As we said in June, we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum.
Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees reached a record $504 million, up 14% year-on-year, inclusive of 2 percentage point impact from currency translation and were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pretax margin approaching 35%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation as well as about $25 million of money market fee waivers this quarter.
While we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $35 million per quarter, as a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates following the June FOMC meeting, we now expect that they will be about $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the rest of the year, which is about 1/3 lower than we had previously expected.
Global Advisors recorded solid flows across institutional, ETF and cash for the quarter, with the total amount amounting to $83 billion. We have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, which are driving this momentum, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide.
Turning to Slide 8. Let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remain above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Relative to a strong second quarter in 2020, FX revenue fell 12% year-on-year as declining FX market volatility compared to the COVID environment last year more than offset higher client volumes. FX revenue was down 17% quarter-on-quarter, driven by a moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility.
Our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth, with fees increasing 18% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody and agency balances as client leverage rebounded. Finally, second quarter software and processing fees were down 12% year-on-year, largely due to the absence of prior year positive mark-to-market adjustments. Software and processing fees increased 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher CRD revenues.
Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to provide some further updates on our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD results in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 10% year-on-year, resulting in an increase in stand-alone annualized recurring revenue to $230 million. This quarter marks the 3-year anniversary since announcing the CRD acquisition, and we're very pleased with how the business has performed. We're winning in part, thanks to State Street's brand and reputation and the benefit to clients of our integrated Alpha offering.
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the second quarter highlights from State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 2 new Alpha mandates during the second quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through the second quarter, we now have 5 Alpha client mandates that are live. Although Alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement, given the size and scope, the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share of wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract lengths, which can be up to 10 years in length for Alpha services that span the front and middle office.
Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII declined 16% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment on our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo product. These impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion, driven by higher balances. Relative to the first quarter, however, NII was flat as lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of short-end rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity.
On the right side of the slide, we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Total average deposits increased by $16 billion in the second quarter or an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy.
While we continue to remain mindful of OCI risk in the current rate environment, we tactically added about $5 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago before the recent downdraft in rates. We also increased our average loan balances by approximately 5% quarter-on-quarter to over $29 billion, driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call client. We also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptake that we saw during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by the weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation, total expenses were down nearly 0.5 percentage point year-on-year as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue-related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs compared to 2Q '20 on a line item basis. And excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation, compensation and employee benefit cost was flat as we reduced high cost location head count, which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels.
Information systems and communications were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing was up 10%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses for sub-custody balances and market data costs. Occupancy was down 13%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits. And other expenses were down 11%, primarily driven by lower-than-usual professional services fees. Relative to the first quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter.
So overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline as we have effectively managed total expenses ex notables and currency, down year-on-year in the second quarter, while driving strong total fee revenue growth.
Moving to Slide 12. On the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased with our performance under this year's CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at that floor. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our capital base in a number of different ways, including investment opportunities, dividends and buybacks. For example, yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share, and our Board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion from the third quarter of 2021 through year-end 2022. In addition, we're also pleased that the Federal Reserve has provided State Street with 1 additional year until January 1, 2024, to retain its current G-SIB surcharge of 1%.
To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 11.2% as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation, and we also managed down RWAs despite balance sheet growth.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum, but declined by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 5.2%, primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the Fed's quantitative easing continues. We continue to think that a Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 5s as appropriate for our business model, and we can operate at the lower end of this range for a number of quarters while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives.
Turning to Slide 13. In summary, our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our top line and the scale we are driving within our operating model. Total fee revenue was up almost 6% year-on-year and exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, with double-digit growth in servicing and management fees despite the year-on-year headwind from the strong FX trading services result we had in the second quarter of last year during COVID. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result of our productivity program. As a result, we are able to drive pretax margin and ROE close to our medium-term targets, notwithstanding the low rate environment.
Next, I'd like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook. At a macro level, our rate view broadly aligns the current forward rate curve and assumes that short-end rates remain low and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve. We are also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market activity.
In terms of the third quarter of 2021, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 7% to 8% year-over-year, with servicing and management fees each expected to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. This means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided.
Regarding NII, despite the recent flattening of the yield curve, we have seen an increase in short-end market rates, and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the rest of the year, assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate.
Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs. We expect that third quarter expenses, ex notable items, will be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 percentage point year-over-year in 3Q. These fee and expense guides for 3Q include approximately 1 point of currency translation year-over-year. On taxes, we expect that the 3Q '21 tax rate will be in the middle of our full year range of 17% to 19%.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

The areas that we'd like to lean into are the institutional business first, and I'll come back to the ETF business. But the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world, but a limited product set. So what we've spent a lot of time thinking about is how do we take those relationships in that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities.
On the ETF side, we have been on a long path to developing the product set there as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the U.S. You've seen a lot of payoff from that, particularly in EMEA. We'll continue to grow that. Areas of growth include ESG, which for us continues to do very nicely as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core product set. It was -- it's an institutionally designed product set. It has a lot of liquidity to it. And liquidity is important to many investors. So it's emphasizing what we have there.
And then the cash business is -- obviously, it's a function of interest rates. But we have a very sophisticated cash business that works in different interest rate environments, and we'll continue to present that to both existing asset management and asset servicing clients as well as clients that don't have either of those relationships with us."

I think we're seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses in addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets. And I think it's a combination of both, equity markets were up globally quarter-on-quarter 5%. So that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses. But in addition, I think what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues. Last quarter, I said we were relatively neutral on net new business and servicing fees. This quarter, we're nicely positive on that front, on the servicing fee side.
In management fees, we've been booking a couple of quarters here in a row of very nice inflows. They've come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well. And then you saw we've had good performance across our sec lending franchise. CRD had another good quarter. And so we're comfortable with a higher guide.
I think I gave you primarily third quarter information, and then maybe just to try to answer the question directly, the full year fee guide, if you recall, was taken up last quarter to 2.5% to 4% year-over-year. Remember, that includes lapping ourselves from the COVID bump from FX a year ago. So our guide had been 2.5% to 4% for total fee growth. And I think now you can count on around 5% growth. So we're going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being, given what we know today."

And what you've seen us do is we've try to put some of the additional deposits to work. You've seen us take advantage of the increase in IOER and the Fed floor on repo rates, so that's been constructive.
We do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet, because as we compress the balance sheet, that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital, and so we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits. We had more of an uptick in May and June. April has kind of been roughly in line with the first quarter. And so we're starting to chip away at that, and we see a path to do that.
I don't think that will have much of an effect on NII. Remember at these low rates, deposits, when you -- the incremental deposit is worth a little bit, but not a lot. But it will be the right way to manage the balance of NII, which I think will comfortably sit in that new range that we provided, while also freeing up space for capital return, which is an important priority for us."

What you tend to get, it's not whether it's Alpha deals or classic custody in accounting deals. It's really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates. And so we saw some larger deals this quarter. And because it's the denominator of assets is larger, it will come a little lighter in terms of fee rate.
On the other hand, in the first quarter, we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate. And so you kind of have a number of combinations and what we're always doing is on a profitability basis, on an incremental basis, always making sure that as we add revenues, we do it at healthy margins. We use it as a way to control our costs and be disciplined.
And so I think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next, but we're actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year is well in line with our overall fee rate for the company. And that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins."

There are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time and place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what's possible and what we'd like to do, knowing",393,"Ken, it's Eric. There are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time and place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what's possible and what we'd like to do, knowing that there's always -- that they always have to manage to the -- individually to the quarters. But the SCB does give us some flexibility. So let me do it in the following way.
One of the things we start with is what is our CET1 ratio, and you saw we put in 11.2%. The first thing you can do is compare that to what's the target range, 10% to 11%. You can say, look, first step is how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range. And that provides $700 million, $800 million of capital return capacity. So that's one piece.
Secondly, you go through earnings, earnings next quarter, the quarter after, you guys all have projections of earnings. And what we do with those earnings is say, how do we give those earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return. So one part of that is the dividend. And then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks. That's an intention we often have. So you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 quarters that we gave you, kind of a 6-quarter view.
And then finally, the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit, not at the same intensity that a lending-oriented bank does, but our balance sheet might grow risk-weighted assets by 5%. So there's kind of a -- there's always a bit of capital retention that's necessary just to fund on a $120 billion of RWA, 5%, you always need to retain maybe $600 million typically in a year of capital to hold against that.
So if you go through those pieces, it's literally the down -- the floating down. It's the -- what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks. And then it's the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth, which I think pencils out to that up to $3 billion range."

Premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next, just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth. But what's happening is you've got the grind on the investment portfolio, which can be in the $15 million to $25 million range. And then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction. In the upcoming quarters, we're thinking it's in the $15 million range, but it will bounce around.
And so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through, premium amortization going the other way. But it can bounce around plus/minus $5 million easily from one quarter to the next, and that's the kind of thing we just want to be careful of.
What is nice is we're starting to get to a leveling off of the net yields on the portfolios, roll-offs are starting to get better matched with roll-ons. I think that's a good word to use, roll-off and roll-on of bonds. And so you saw that we printed net yield on the investment portfolio of about a 1.11%, 1.12%, we're pretty close to the bottom of that yield. And that's what gives us comfort that we're in this range for the time being, though. As you could see from my prepared remarks, we took the -- that -- the upper end of that range up a bit just because of the improvement in front-end rates."

Let me touch on each of those because we're real pleased with the CRD performance, both in terms of this quarter's wins, the backlog, I think the momentum and obviously, how it contributes to the broader State Street whole. Just to take through the new bookings, $19 million for the quarter was a 5-quarter high. Some of that, I think you can easily ascribe to the Invesco win, which was front office, middle office, back office, as we continue to expand that relationship. And you'd have within the $19 million, the front office piece of that win.
On the uninstalled backlog, the $93 million, it's a mix of installations that come over 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, in some cases, 24 months. What I will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees, as you prepare and do those implementations, the classic -- in the classic software sense, those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts until you get to the go-live period, which in some cases, a short for smaller installations. In other cases, it takes longer just given the size and complexity of what we're onboarding.
And then I think, finally, you asked about the total revenues. The on-premise revenues were -- hit a high of -- another high, just like a year ago, coincidently of $63 million. Some of that was the classic re-upping of installations and that renew from 3-year-old contracts, 5-year-old contracts, that kind of stuff. I think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the $20 million to $25 million range. So I just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters, over 5 quarters, 9 quarters, that kind of thing. And that will give you a better sense for what's typical in that on-premise line, but maybe that's enough to start with."

I'd tell you on, Tier 1 leverage, we're comfortable operating in the 5s. And this is right way risk. If you think about it, we've got an influx of deposits. They're held at the safest place in the world, the Fed and the central banks. And so we're not particularly exercised that bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range. So that's fine as long as we have plans over time that we can execute. And we do have those plans, that's what we do for a living. And as I mentioned, we've got actions in place.
Some of those deposits came in a little heavier in May and June. We've got a set, for example, of ongoing client discussions of a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions, for example, around $10 billion of those that are literally happening, that have happened last week, this week. And so there are ways for us to chip away at that.
In terms of the buyback patterning, while it's always dependent on facts and circumstances and exactly what's going on at any point in time, we don't have an interest in backloading buybacks necessarily, like we'd rather do them relatively smoothly, again, all else being equal. And we think we have plenty of capacity, given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way, and in a way I think that shareholders would appreciate."

There are a couple of factors in there that both get at a total balance sheet and then the risk-weighted asset content of the balance sheet, I think we have to distinguish those two. Let me just tackle your questions in order.
On the NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the next couple of quarters, that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts. Remember, the incremental $10 billion deposits doesn't earn us a ton these days. And so that's been factored in to that range. And the underlying reason in that range has slowed up a little bit as the front-end rates have ticked up, which was gratifying.
In terms of balance sheet growth, we need to contain the size of the balance sheet in terms of size, call it, leverage assets, right? That's what we need to contain. Under the surface, there's always some amount of healthy growth in risk-weighted assets, right, because as we support our clients in the FX business or in the sec lending business or by lending to them, we have to expand those modestly.
Now on our balance sheet, we're a capital-light business. We've got a -- we have RWAs on our balance sheet that are in the $120 billion range. What -- I don't know, there's a range of what those can grow, but they're not growing at 10% a year. They may be growing 5-ish percent a year, plus/minus a couple of points. And so it's kind of that level. And when you grow RWAs, that amount, you're not really adding to the leverage balance sheet. The leverage balance sheet, which connects with Tier 1 leverage is driven primarily with deposits, and that's separable from the RWA kind of growth typically."

So I'll remind you of in the calculation between the all-in corp LCR and the bank. And the best way I can describe it is what's most pertinent to us as an institution, a bank holding company, is actually the bank LCR. The bank LCR is at 131%. So it's extremely flush, and it's got plenty of room.
What happens at the corp is that the additional deposits get haircut just because of transferability, which is fine. And what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator, I'm happy to put you in touch with our IR team to share with you some of the scenarios, is that as we become more flush at the bank, which is a good thing, you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the LCR goes down.
What's ironic is that if we were to begin to reduce deposits, what happens mathematically is that the bank LCR starts to flow down from this very elevated 131% and the corporate LCR actually floats up. And I think it's best to probably have -- so when we work through the algebra with you, it's just how the rules are configured. They're fine.

We've gotten expenses down, ex notables and adjusted for currency, down 2% and 1.5% last year and this year. What we've said is that on a nominal basis, we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 basis point range. And that's nominally and on an adjusted currency basis and notables, it would be down by about 1 point, obviously, with a range around that.
And obviously, the biggest thing that we wrestle through this year, in particular, is that there are revenue-related costs that come through, as we've mentioned, some custody costs are often AUC/A based, market data costs are AUC/A or AUM based. And so those are what we're working through and why we have a range there. And we've stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today.
I think the -- if I step back, the hallmark of our approach to cost is that you've got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit, but save a good amount of cost, right? And I think we show you typically when we do our January call, at the beginning of the year, that we're looking to take 4 or 5 percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs. We -- and that on a base of $8 billion, 4 or 5 points is -- that's significant amounts. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, but we're a scale business. That's what we should be doing.
And at the same time, what we're doing is reinvesting a portion of that, not all of that, but a portion of that in the underlying business. And sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces. Sometimes, we reinvest by expanding in product feature functionality. Sometimes we invest as we onboard clients, right? We have some marginal cost that we have to have, and we're usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it. And so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest. And we'll continue to do that.
Now how those balance out, we've given you a sense of how that balances out to down expenses in '19, in 2020, it was down. And this year, we expect to be down as well, again, adjusted for notables and currency translation. How that plays out, we're going to keep working through. It's a little early to talk about next year. But I think you can tell we're pretty focused on this. But obviously, we do need to factor in revenue-related costs. And as equity market continue to tick upwards, we have to factor that in, and that's a little more of a feature this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been. And so that is something that we have to work through. But at least that's the broad approach."

You've seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases. So remember, custody can get installed quickly when it's won.

That's exactly the result that we're seeing, because what we're finding is not only do we expand up the -- up and down the value chain, we had the front office, the middle office in many cases, and the back office. But as you do that, it's much more natural to begin to say, if you're going to add middle office and back office to begin to consolidate the custody, for example, in the relationship or to connect with the -- some of the trading activity that we have because some of the trading activity can plug for example, directly into Charles River.
So that's the underlying benefit is the expanded share of wallet supplemented by these become even stickier relationships. These become true partnerships as opposed to a service arrangement."

I mean we -- what we've done is over the course of now a couple of years, taken a very good sales and relationship management force and made it better. We have the benefit in most of our instances because of the core passive products where if we're in a client, we tend to be, if not the largest manager, one of the largest, which by definition, gives you a seat at their table as they think about asset allocation, those kinds of things.
So it's been very systematically building out and upgrading our capability to have those conversations and provide those products and to have an increased share of their wallet. ESG has been providing some real tailwind here. We've got a long history in it. We've got a strong reputation in it. And we've been able to both have those conversations and shape a lot of asset allocation there.
In terms of products, I mean it's -- if you think about it, it's -- we tend to dominate one end of the barbell. So as you look out across the rest of the barbell, almost anything would be eligible. Our focus is on now multi-asset products and building some of those ourselves or creating them bespoke from -- for very large clients through product capabilities that we already have. But the way we're thinking about it conceptually is that we have a distinctive strength in terms of our institutional sales and client management capabilities, and we're thinking about how to do that. We think there's organic opportunities.
In terms of inorganic, I mean, those -- they're hard to engineer, right? So if something comes along that makes sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we'll certainly look at it, but there's been plenty of organic that we've been able to do that you're now seeing in the results."

In terms of your point about the leverage we're getting out of the employee base, I'd make a couple of points there, that the composition of that also has changed, too. I mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lower-cost locations, so you'd find that the mix has changed over that period. But you're raising actually the more important point, which is technology.
And listen, service productivity -- and it's not just this service, and it's not just this firm, service productivity has been elusive for a long time now. And I think we, and I suspect others, are getting our arms around it. A lot of it is automation. A lot of it is taking -- and automation and services, it's not the quite same thing as you envision an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms. It tends to be you're taking many, many tasks that constitute a job and automating those, such that what's remaining in the job is higher value-added and those things where you need judgment. We're getting better and better at instituting that.
We also, Mike, are -- and we've talked about this in other context, we're spending a lot of time on measuring productivity. Again, manufacturers, the good ones have had this down for a long time, service companies, it's much newer. We've got a significant percentage of our company now that's covered by productivity metrics. And sometimes, it's the old Hawthorne effect, right? You just -- now that there's a measure and you're seeing, hey, there's a difference between this group and that group, and they're pretty similar in situating and doing the same thing, what can we learn from that? And that is starting to drive some of that productivity.
On the technology side, I stand by the team that we have. It's an outstanding team. It's making a lot of progress. As you know, in technology, it's -- some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities, and that's part of the investment that we're making. A lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience. This is an ongoing issue for the industry, particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up. And as a G-SIFI, we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there.
But I think we're making very good progress. It's showing up in the numbers. Again, it's the result, not just the things that we did last quarter, but the things that we've done now for many quarters and approaching years and they're starting to pay off, and you'll see more pay off in the future."

That certainly is sustainable. I think the what we'd actually like to do, and you've seen in different quarters, if you go back to the last few earnings releases, is that the combination of professional services and software-enabled revenue is actually growing nicely in the double digits, not -- in some cases, closer to 15%.
And because what's happening is two things. One is you've got take up in the market for new installations. And I think we've described in the past, the number of SaaS clients, for example, is up. But you also have, over time, conversion from on-premise to SaaS because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering, a more standardized cloud offering. It still has to connect with their -- the rest of their estate, where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis.
So that's a -- that component of the professional services and software-enabled set of revenues in Charles River, I think, are going to be in the mid to -- in the double-digit teens typically. They'll just bounce around a little bit with professional services, but that's a real -- that's -- I think that's the future of the franchise is in those areas."

Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise.

Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients and generating the performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution, we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results even as we invest in our business for the future.
We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-term financial targets.
We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company's history, while AUC/A 1, but not yet installed stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end.
At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year with year-to-date SPDR flows on track for a record year and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors financial performance continues to strengthen, with pretax margin expanding to 36% in Q3.
I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our investment servicing business and our overall strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling as it will enhance State Street's financial profile, and importantly, it will create long-term value for our shareholders.
From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership and deepen geographic coverage, with State Street becoming the #1 provider of asset servicing globally by assets under custody. Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street's already strong expertise and better position us for growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pretax margin target.
Turning to Slide 3. I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year. we delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong improvement in State Street's third quarter pretax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-over-year to over 29%. This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results and higher NII supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained.
Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-year, respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation of FX market volatility.
Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the same period. Though expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements continued to yield results.
AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with legal in general, which was announced in July. As a result, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago.
Including the legal and general mandate, we reported 3 new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, making the total number of -- taking the total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end.
At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy.
At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end, and management fees increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate. For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through 3 quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the U.S. in terms of asset growth with the SPDR Blackstone senior loan ETF. By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion in flows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter for the launch of the SPDR Lumi sales opportunistic bond ETF.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital. We completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of next year. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets, and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion and value creation for our shareholders over time.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."
188785,1682227310,2407051,"State Street Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2021",2021-10-18,"Earnings Calls","State Street Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone.

We reported GAAP EPS of $1.96 or $2, excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item, controlled expenses. We delivered significant pretax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth. In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter where we were able to demonstrate the progress we are making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets.
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see our business volume growth. Period-end, AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and flows and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about a percentage point of currency translation from the U.S. dollar appreciation.
AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we've garnered year-to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year.
At quarter end, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front-to-back office offering from a single provider. I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. And as we've discussed previously, we would expect current one, but yet to be installed AUC/A to be converted over the coming 12- to 24-month time period with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through 2022 and and about half in 2023. We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based geographic and multisegment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pretax margin of about 36%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional asset -- client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers. Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates, we now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward rates.
Lastly, if you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional ETF franchises, and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide.
Turning to Slide 8. Let me discuss the other important revenue -- fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remained above prepandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year, reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads.
Moving to securities finance. Third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and spreads as well as business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances.
Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to next.
Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD results in the quarter with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all 3 categories of CRD revenues, on-premise, professional services and software enabled. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business momentum that we're seeing in CRD supported by the Alpha value proposition. 
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 3 new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception, through third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client mandates that are live. As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition, we've also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for Private Markets, which will extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives.
Turning to Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in the investment portfolio and more deposits as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter '20 true-up partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the second quarter, NII came in 4% higher primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment portfolio as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields. I would also note that we saw a larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some tactical rotation on the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about 1/3 of the sequential quarter improvement and something we wouldn't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the active management of nonoperational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to good client demand.
Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year as productivity savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds and $10 million to $20 million of higher-than-expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third quarter of last year on a line item basis, excluding notables, Compensation employee benefits was down 1%, driven by higher salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefit costs as claims begin to normalize. Information Systems and Communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs.
Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses associated with subcustody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%, primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative to the second quarter, expenses excluding notable items, were down primarily driven by the currency translation of the strong dollar and lower headcount.
Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline while driving high single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pretax margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 12. On the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services business, we completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and return a total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid.
So left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some excess deposits and higher retained earnings. Post closing of the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges.
Turning to Slide 13. In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all businesses with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat excluding the impact of notable items as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue-related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-on-year and we're able to drive pretax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets even in this low rate environment.
Next, I'd like to update our outlook. With just 1 quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the full year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward rate curve. We're also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. 
In terms of the full year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations. We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance.
Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short end market rates and some movement in the longer end of the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to trend favorably, though, as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q.
Turning to expenses. We remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs while onboarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and a healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business as well as covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full year expenses ex notables to be up 1% to 1.25% year-over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full year expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind, and this would put us in a position to drive solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII.
On taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private market expansion, in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth.

Ron, you've been very vocal about sort of the secular changes in the asset management industry that are sort of supporting your growth strategy on the servicing fee side, and a lot of that just emphasize the scale. So I guess with that in mind, do you think SSGA has enough scale to succeed in the marketplace today? And if there are sort of strategic alternatives that you're considering, do you need to remain a majority shareholder of any asset management kind of entity or if minority or a GB structure would make more sense, the capital rules just too onerous and the obstacles to get too high to ultimately get anything done here?"

So it sounds like a lot of it is just timing with the next kind of 12 to 24 months. Hopefully, we'll see the benefit of the revenue on the yet to be installed business. Can you help us frame and sort of size the revenue pool attached the $2.7 trillion on yet to be installed? And then within that, maybe hit on the pricing dynamics as well. I think in your comments that the -- you continue to see kind of normal pricing headwinds in the business. I think it's been kind of in the 2% to 3% range long term. Is that sort of the headwind we're still talking about? Or has that changed?"

I think we continue to see the normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they're well controlled. We feel like they're understandable, they're logical. And that headwind is back down to about 2%, which is the historical norm. And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that, of course. And the duration of some of these deals will, I think, help reinforce that over time.
We are very pleased, I think, as you could expect, with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for that matter. And they're certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company. We don't -- I think we don't feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that. But they are in that range that you see -- that you broadly see on average, and that gives us confidence that as this business gets installed, it's going to have a meaningful impact to revenues. We've been clear. We need about $1.5 billion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates that we have creates the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So that's why we put that benchmark out there.
And what I would say is, while I think we've had until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we need to continue the momentum we've been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel comfortable with the pipeline, and we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year."

And obviously, it's early with Brown Brothers Investment Services. We're now -- we've now gotten our regulatory filings in. We're obviously working through the closing process and with our continuing to target a year-end close.
In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it's a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it's similar asset management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get similar betas and well, similar betas and adjustments overall. I think what's different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank sweep program, we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates. And so that could, in a way, enhance our asset sensitivity, though you have to be careful by the -- you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint -- leverage ratio constraints that we have, which also led us adjust the amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business.
So I'd say, overall, it's probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and NII or to manage leverage. And I think that's a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue.
In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it'd be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we've achieved before. I think -- but it's hard to compare to past deals to, I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need to bring this business on, and I've said in the past, we've not always finished what we started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering. And I think that's why it's been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there's -- we'll see. I think it's early. I think we'll be -- we'll certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and we'll certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as I'm hopeful we can -- we certainly want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it's a little early to lean too far."

And then for my second question, Ron, actually, Eric, when you provided the color on the fourth quarter expense expectation you made reference to some needs to invest and whatnot. I know it's probably early. You're probably just starting to work on the budget for 2022. But cost inflation is very much on the minds of investors. We hear about it broadly. One of your competitors at a recent conference raised the point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in 2022. Should we begin to prepare for a bit of a lift? Is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality and then think about that into next year? Is there just some general guiding principles you could provide to help people level set on '22?"

So we are definitely seeing that. But we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business. We're engineering them in. So we do see an ability to offset some, if not all that. And we're just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don't want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that -- I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line. So it's something we're watching out for. And there are particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent, but not at an overwhelming -- we're not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet. Eric, you probably want to add something."

And while it means there's more work to do. There's always more work to do. That's just how it plays out.
I think from a -- if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process, which is just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December, is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that with a positive operating leverage. And you've heard me say before, we don't like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so I think you've got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make a progress each year. You've seen us notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year. We're making progress this year towards those targets. We're proud of that, and we need to feel like we need to continue that."

I'm just wondering, is this a message we should take that the investment spend was a bit under -- you underinvested over the past 1.5 years and now we're going to ramp back up to ""normal""? Or is this more of a temporary, we've got some things specific opportunities that we need to invest in. We can't tell you how many quarters it's going to take, but it's more of a specific opportunity and the positive operating leverage we've been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period? I guess that's part of the reason why there's so many questions on expenses. And if we could frame it like that, would there be any more color you could share with us."

That's been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down BAU expenses, while also continuing to invest in the business particularly in the technology area.
In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we've already started to invest and there's opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the 3 areas that we highlighted were: one, just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private markets. And then third is the whole digital space where you're seeing a lot of activity there, and that's a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business. So that's what we're talking about there.

We're looking for some support and so forth. So I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we're seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low double digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though, is with loans comes RWA. And so what we're always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases, we add. In other cases, we sell fund by optimizing other positions, and that will be part of how we think about it going forward. But we do think of lending as an opportunity for us to drive NII in the coming quarters and years."

I think we clearly have, like others have had some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back, call it, 2 years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and is all the increased excess. And I'd say that's not true. What we've had over the last 2 years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. And so a good bit of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is so some, as you've seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don't necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients.
If you go from -- with that context to the, I think, the next part of your question, which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed's balance sheet or rising rates. Does that reverse the course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it will be a while. It will be a 2- to 3-year process for that to happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet, right? They're just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It's not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet. And so as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we're probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they're core, right, partly driven by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would be a positive -- would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the other banks as well."

So this isn't about slugging it out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees, that's to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what these institutions are doing for themselves. The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It's not just that investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the U.S. and Europe, you're seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies.

And as you note, it's certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and related activities, it's a capital-light business. So when you add it all together, we like the business, but we recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification, and it's not up to us to diversify for you. We have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that we're good owners, and we can continue to grow the business, and we are looking at this all the time."

And that's what both create sales and sales opportunity because we've said over time, something like 2/3, 3/4 of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients when they're spending their needs, being there when they add funds or when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do. Now sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we've got. And so we have very active programs when that happens. And that's part of the industry. We've got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter Score work that we do, that we've expanded over the last 2 years to now take on a very large portion of our clients. So that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our clients. And then it's our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how do you provide with our Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we're staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they're as satisfied and as can be.
So those are some of the elements, and I'd say it's deep in our culture and something we work on. That said, you've got to keep -- if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we've done in the last few quarters. We've been able to drive core growth, which we're very pleased with. We've got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients, and you've seen us do that successfully. And then on the other side, we -- I think we feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be -- that's always an area of intense effort and I'd say this year has been successful as well."

I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they could provide us. We do that certainly on a stand-alone basis because you've got to look at every asset on the balance sheet, whether it's lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or FX business. And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there's always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they did do more securities finance for enhanced custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns. So I'd say there's certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition, we are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so I think while you've seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next 1 to 2 quarters, I think you'll see -- you'll continue to see some discipline. You've seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance. And you can imagine we'll do that going into the beginning of next year.
But what I would say is I think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there'll be some ebbs and flows. And I think I've given you a little bit of an indication where we see some of those."

It's that 4-part structure. I think the way I'd update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we've seen a very strong equity market tailwinds this year. I don't think we're going to see that every year, but we'd like to see flat to up equity market. So you can imagine that part of a tailwind was very positive this year, which we're pleased with. And the way we monetize that is we didn't take our expenses up with equity market uptick.
The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple of points. I think a year or 2 ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both -- especially in the U.S. as mutual funds were on the wane, and we saw less inflows in Europe. I think we felt less confident in client activity and flows of the tailwind. I think that's actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics. Net new business, as you referenced, I think we've got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to get implemented next year and the year after. So that takes time, but we're pleased with the backlog.
And then pricing, I think, as I said, I think, on the first question this morning has been well controlled, and we just work on that intensely every day. So I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the -- of that framework."

So on the leverage r",327,"Sure. And let me open up the aperture a little bit. Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1, right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio measure. So on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so the decision on deposits and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we're sitting at. I think the way to think about deposits is when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near 0, you're not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around 2 or 3 rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis points of Fed funds you start to be the right way around or you'd prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so it's somewhere in that area, call it, 2, 3 rate hikes from now, where we begin to seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being -- instead of holding them off.
And so I think the question that we will -- the decision criteria that we'll get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year. And at that point, we'll make some conscious decisions and trade off additional NII, which we'd like to bring in because it helps with our margin and our EPS. And we'll just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you've seen us manage the balance sheet side. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it's not like we -- well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet. I think we'll continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best as we can."

So mostly U.K., but some -- there's an American element to that also. In that case, it was, for the most part, a new client to us, we did not have -- we had a nominal existing relationship to it. And it's an alpha-driven mandate. So lots of activities will be coming our way over time. If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a U.S.-based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we've -- we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office.
So I would say that what we've seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it's been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it's been -- there's been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning. So it's enabled us to drive new client growth and what's incumbent upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it's a new client, there they've got the traditional servicing business with somebody else. So what we are doing strategically is we'll have the discussion on Alpha, we'll win the Alpha and then say, now we want to move the servicing business over.
In terms of the core wins, the -- I would say that there's been a little bit of a cycle here and Eric will correct me if I'm getting this wrong. But after -- if you go back a couple -- 3 years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the U.S., and we've seen actually over the past couple of years, a lot of activity in EMEA. And it's not so much that it's been less U.S. It's just been more activity in EMEA. So that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that, that had been done in the U.S. hadn't quite been done until more recently in EMEA. So it's -- what we like is it's nicely mixed. And more recently, we're starting to see some activity in Asia Pacific, and we're really excited about Brown Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we'll be able to leverage to support even more growth there."

So it's kind of 2/3, 1/3, but what I think I'm particularly pleased with is we're able to hold expenses flat, notwithstanding that. And that's not been our history here as we've managed.
On the management fee side, it was just the way that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there, us taking up our margin in the asset management business.

But if you think about what swept away, I think we said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You're not talking about a real capacity constraint. And we did -- we have done and we've actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with, right? We often do business with those counterparties on the subcustody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so there's kind of a -- there's a bidirectional set of relationships that we have.

And as Eric has noted, we've invested behind our revenue growth. So the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it's been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU spending? And second, where and how is the growth coming in? In terms of what we're investing in, it really isn't changing much other than from a balance perspective. I would say that much of the investment that you've seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole resilience area, the whole -- I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there's a -- we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it's not going to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. It really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So we explain why, but that would be Alpha private market and State Street Digital kind of primarily. What I would add to that, continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors. I mean, the investments we've made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we -- the investments we made in European ETFs and a low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we're gathering disproportionate share in those space. So that's how we think about it. I mean you shouldn't expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don't know anything about or that are new to us, but it's about things that we've already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth."

Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for",971,"Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients and generating the performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution, we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results even as we invest in our business for the future.
We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-term financial targets.
We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company's history, while AUC/A won but not yet installed stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end.
At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year with year-to-date SPDR flows on track for a record year and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors' financial performance continues to strengthen, with pretax margin expanding to 36% in Q3.
I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our investment servicing business and our overall strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling as it will enhance State Street's financial profile, and importantly, it will create long-term value for our shareholders.
From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership and deepen geographic coverage, with State Street becoming the #1 provider of asset servicing globally by assets under custody. Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street's already strong expertise and better position us for growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pretax margin target.
Turning to Slide 3. I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year. We delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong improvement in State Street's third quarter pretax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-over-year to over 29%. This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results and higher NII supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained.
Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-year, respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation of FX market volatility.
Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the same period though expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements continued to yield results.
AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with Legal & General, which was announced in July. As a result, AUC/A won but not yet installed increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago.
Including the legal and general mandate, we reported 3 new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, making the total number of -- taking the total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end.
At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy.
At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end, and management fees increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate. For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through 3 quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the U.S. in terms of asset growth with the SPDR Blackstone senior loan ETF. By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion in flows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter for the launch of the SPDR Loomis Sayles Opportunistic Bond ETF.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital. We completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of next year. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets, and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion and value creation for our shareholders over time.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail."

We reported GAAP EPS of $1.96 or $2, excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item. 
Controlled expenses, we delivered significant pretax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth. In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter where we were able to demonstrate the progress we are making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets.
Turning to Slide 5, you'll see our business volume growth. Period-end, AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. This year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels.
Turning to Slide 6. You can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and flows and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about a percentage point of currency translation from the U.S. dollar appreciation.
AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we've garnered year-to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year.
At quarter end, AUC/A won but not yet installed amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front-to-back office offering from a single provider. I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. And as we've discussed previously, we would expect current won but yet to be installed AUC/A to be converted over the coming 12- to 24-month time period with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through 2022 and about half in 2023. 
We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based geographic and multisegment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in 2022.
Turning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pretax margin of about 36%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional asset -- client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers. Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short end rates, we now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward rates.
Lastly, if you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide.
Turning to Slide 8. Let me discuss the other important revenue -- fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remained above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year, reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads.
Moving to securities finance. Third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and spreads as well as business wins in Enhanced Custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances.
Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to next.
Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong stand-alone CRD results in the quarter with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all 3 categories of CRD revenues, on-premise, professional services and software enabled. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business momentum that we're seeing in CRD supported by the Alpha value proposition. 
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 3 new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception, through the third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client mandates that are live. As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition, we've also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for Private Markets, which will extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives.
Turning to Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in the investment portfolio and more deposits as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter '20 true-up partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the second quarter, NII came in 4% higher, primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment portfolio as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields. I would also note that we saw a larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some tactical rotation on the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about 1/3 of the sequential quarter improvement and something we wouldn't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the active management of nonoperational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to good client demand.
Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year as productivity savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds and $10 million to $20 million of higher-than-expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third quarter of last year on a line item basis, excluding notables, compensation and employee benefits was down 1%, driven by higher salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefit costs as claims begin to normalize. Information Systems and Communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs.
Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses associated with subcustody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%, primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative to the second quarter, expenses excluding notable items, were down primarily driven by the currency translation of the strong dollar and lower headcount.
Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline while driving high single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pretax margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 12. On the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services business, we completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and returned a total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid.
On the left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some excess deposits and higher retained earnings. Post closing of the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges.
Turning to Slide 13. In summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all businesses with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat excluding the impact of notable items as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue-related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-on-year and we're able to drive pretax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets even in this low rate environment.
Next, I'd like to update our outlook. With just 1 quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the full year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward rate curve. We're also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. 
In terms of the full year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations. We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance.
Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short end market rates and some movement in the longer end of the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to trend favorably, though, as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q.
Turning to expenses. We remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs while onboarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and a healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business as well as covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full year expenses ex notables to be up 1% to 1.25% year-over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full year expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind, and this would put us in a position to drive solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII.
On taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron."

To conclude our prepared remarks, we had a strong third quarter and continue to demonstrate measurable progress towards achieving our medium-term financial targets, including our recently increased pretax margin target. As we look ahead, we need to both appropriately recognize staff for a strong year and proactively invest in our business as we see growth accelerate. These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private markets expansion, in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth. As we stand here today and make these business investments for the next stage of growth, we have confidence that we will be able to do so while also delivering positive operating leverage and expanding our pretax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses.
With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions."

So I guess with that in mind, do you think SSGA has enough scale to succeed in the marketplace today? And if there are sort of strategic alternatives that you're considering, do you need to remain a majority shareholder of any asset management kind of entity or if minority or a GB structure would make more sense?

Can you help us frame and sort of size the revenue pool attached the $2.7 trillion on yet to be installed? And then within that, maybe hit on the pricing dynamics as well.

I think we continue to see the normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they're well controlled. We feel like they're understandable, they're logical.

And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that, of course. And the duration of some of these deals will, I think, help reinforce that over time.
We are very pleased, I think, as you could expect, with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for that matter. And they're certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company. We don't -- I think we don't feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that. But they are in that range that you see -- that you broadly see on average, and that gives us confidence that as this business gets installed, it's going to have a meaningful impact to revenues. We've been clear. We need about $1.5 billion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates that we have creates the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So that's why we put that benchmark out there.
And what I would say is, while I think we've had until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we need to continue the momentum we've been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel comfortable with the pipeline, and we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year."

And obviously, it's early with Brown Brothers Investment Services. We're now -- we've now gotten our regulatory filings in. We're obviously working through the closing process and with our continuing target, a year-end close.
In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it's a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it's similar asset management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get similar betas and well, similar betas and adjustments overall. I think what's different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank's sweep program, we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates. And so that could, in a way, enhance our asset sensitivity, though you have to be careful by the -- you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint -- leverage ratio constraints that we have, which also let us adjust the amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business.
So I'd say, overall, it's probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and NII or to manage leverage. And I think that's a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue.
In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it'd be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we've achieved before. I think -- but it's hard to compare to past deals too, I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need to bring this business on, and I've said in the past, we've not always finished what we've started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering. 
And I think that's why it's been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there's -- we'll see. I think it's early. I think we'll be -- we'll certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and we'll certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as CFO, I'm hopeful we can -- we certainly want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it's a little early to lean too far."

One of your competitors at a recent conference raised the point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in 2022. Should we begin to prepare for a bit of a lift? Is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality and then think about that in the next year?

And we're just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don't want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that -- I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line.

That's just how it plays out.
I think from a -- if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process, which is just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December, is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that with a positive operating leverage? And you've heard me say before, we don't like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so I think you've got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make a progress each year.

I'm just wondering, is this a message we should take that the investment spend was a bit under -- you underinvested over the past 1.5 years and now we're going to ramp back up to ""normal""? Or is this more of a temporary, we've got some things, specific opportunities that we need to invest in. We can't tell you how many quarters it's going to take, but it's more of a specific opportunity and the positive operating leverage we've been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period?

In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we've already started to invest and there's opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the 3 areas that we highlighted were: one, just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private markets. And then third is the whole digital space where you're seeing a lot of activity there, and that's a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business.

So I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we're seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low double digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though, is with loans comes RWA. And so what we're always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases, we add, in other cases, we sell fund by optimizing other positions, and that will be part of how we think about it going forward.

I think we clearly have, like others have had, some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back, call it, 2 years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and it's all the increased excess. And I'd say that's not true. What we've had over the last 2 years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. 
And so a good bit of the increase that we've seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is still some, as you've seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don't necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients.
If you go from -- with that context to the, I think, the next part of your question, which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed's balance sheet or rising rates, does that reverse the course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it will be a while. It will be a 2- to 3-year process for that to happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet, right? They're just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It's not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet. And so as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we're probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they're core, right, partly driven by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would be a positive -- would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the other banks as well."

The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It's not just that investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the U.S. and Europe, you're seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies. And investors want to know what's in their portfolio, including their private portfolio. So we think this is all going to be -- and Mercatus helps us do that, and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model."

We do, as I said, continue to expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields. We do expect some ongoing reduction in premium amortization, not just at that same level. And then we've also been pleased with some of what we've been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio. And that's why we took our range up.

We need to keep at it because if you step back, remember, a portion of every year's wins gets implemented in that particular year. It's something like a 1/3.

There's a long history here in serving our clients, serving them well and being incredibly focused on what they need. And that's what both creates sales and sales opportunity because we've said over time, something like 2/3, 3/4 of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients when they're spending, their needs, being there when they add funds or when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do. 
Now sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we've got. And so we have very active programs when that happens. And that's part of the industry. We've got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter Score work that we do, that we've expanded over the last 2 years to now take on a very large portion of our clients. So that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our clients. And then it's our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how we do coverage with our Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we're staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they're as satisfied and as can be.
So those are some of the elements, and I'd say it's deep in our culture and something we work on. That said, you've got to keep -- if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we've done in the last few quarters. We've been able to drive core growth, which we're very pleased with. We've got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients, and you've seen us do that successfully.

I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they could provide us. We do that certainly on a stand-alone basis because you've got to look at every asset on the balance sheet, whether it's lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or FX business. And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there's always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they to do more securities finance for Enhanced Custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns. 
So I'd say there's certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition, we are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so I think while you've seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next 1 to 2 quarters, I think you'll see -- you'll continue to see some discipline. You've seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance. And you can imagine we'll do that going into the beginning of next year.
But what I would say is I think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there'll be some ebbs and flows.

It's that 4-part structure. I think the way I'd update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we've seen a very strong equity market tailwinds this year. I don't think we're going to see that every year, but we'd like to see flat to up equity market. So you can imagine that part of the tailwind was very positive this year, which we're pleased with. And the way we monetize that is we didn't take our expenses up with equity market uptick.
The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple of points. I think a year or 2 ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both -- especially in the U.S. as mutual funds were on the wane, and we saw less inflows in Europe, I think we felt less confident in client activity and flows of the tailwind. I think that's actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics. Net new business, as you referenced, I think we've got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to get implemented next year and the year after. So that takes time, but we're pleased with the backlog.
And then pricing, I think, as I said, I think, on the first question this morning has been well controlled, and we just work on that intensely every day. So I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the -- of that framework."

Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1, right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio measure. So on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so the decision on deposits and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we're sitting at. 
I think the way to think about deposits is when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near 0, you're not incented to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around 2 or 3 rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis points of Fed funds, you start to be the right way around where you'd prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so it's somewhere in that area, call it, 2, 3 rate hikes from now, where we begin to -- seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being -- instead of holding them off.
And so I think the question that we will -- the decision criteria that we'll get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year. And at that point, we'll make some conscious decisions and trade off additional NII, which we'd like to bring in because it helps with our margin and our EPS. And we'll just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you've seen us manage the balance sheet side. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it's not like we -- well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet. I think we'll continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best as we can."

And it's an alpha-driven mandate. So lots of activities will be coming our way over time. 
If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a U.S.-based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we've -- we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office.
So I would say that what we've seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it's been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it's been -- there's been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning. So it's enabled us to drive new client growth and what's incumbent upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it's a new client, there -- they've got a traditional servicing business with somebody else. So what we are doing strategically is we'll have the discussion on Alpha, we'll win the Alpha and then say, now we want to move the servicing business over.
In terms of the core wins, the -- I would say that there's been a little bit of a cycle here and Eric will correct me if I'm getting this wrong. But after -- if you go back a couple -- 3 years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the U.S., and we've seen actually over the past couple of years, a lot of activity in EMEA. And it's not so much that it's been less U.S. It's just been more activity in EMEA. So that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that, that had been done in the U.S., hadn't quite been done until more recently in EMEA. So it's -- what we like is it's nicely mixed. And more recently, we're starting to see some activity in Asia Pacific, and we're really excited about Brown Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we'll be able to leverage to support even more growth there."

On servicing fees, a large proportion of the up 7% was driven by the equity markets tailwind, a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business. And then in the other direction, you have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds, and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity. So it's kind of 2/3, 1/3, but what I think I'm particularly pleased with is we're able to hold expenses flat, notwithstanding that. And that's not been our history here as we've managed.
On the management fee side, it was just the way that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there, us taking up our margin in the asset management business. And so while we're creating the environment for either an equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management, it's the -- we're also managing the other side of the P&L, and that's been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing."

The sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties. It's not enormous for any 1 bank provider. I think the top 10 bank providers are important. But if you think about what's swept away, I think we said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You're not talking about a real capacity constraint. 
And we did -- we have done and we've actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with, right? We often do business with those counterparties on the subcustody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so there's kind of a -- there's a bidirectional set of relationships that we have. So we don't see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more, sweep a little less. 
What I would say is the core of the sweep's in U.S. dollar. And I don't need to be patriotic to say that the U.S. dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency. And so that's -- so they're certainly valuable to U.S. and global banks. And so I think we've got a good program set up, and we see it continuing with some upside optionality for us."

And as Eric has noted, we've invested behind our revenue growth. So the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it's been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU spending? And second, where and how is the growth coming in? 
In terms of what we're investing in, it really isn't changing much other than from a balance perspective. I would say that much of the investment that you've seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole resilience area, the whole -- I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there's a -- we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it's not going to be a kind of peanut butter thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. 
It really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So we explain why, but that would be Alpha private market and State Street Digital kind of primarily. What I would add to that, continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors. I mean, the investments we've made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we -- the investments we made in European ETFs and low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we're gathering disproportionate share in those space. So that's how we think about it. 
I mean, you shouldn't expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don't know anything about or that are new to us, but it's about things that we've already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth."
