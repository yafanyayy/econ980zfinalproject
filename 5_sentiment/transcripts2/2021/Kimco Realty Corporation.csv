I will begin by giving a quick overview of our accomplishments in 2020 and our strategic focus for 2021 and beyond. Ross will follow with updates on transactions, and Glenn will close with our key metrics and guidance for 2021. For all of us, 2020 was a year that will not soon be forgotten. COVID, the political landscape, social unrests and the responses to these events all converged in a way that will forever change our way of life. 2020 was also a year that demonstrated in volatile times, the best companies are the ones that are able to withstand economic challenges, mitigate risk and take advantage of opportunities. In the shopping center sector, this requires a strong balance sheet, a resilient, well-located portfolio and a superior management team. I 
am happy to report that while we are not immune to the volatility of 2020, Kimco's open air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets performed well, and we have stayed strong, confident and positive about the opportunity in the coming year. Our portfolio withstood all that the pandemic threw at us. As our 2020 vision strategy to reposition our portfolio was validated. Our grocery-anchored essential services and mixed-use assets concentrated in the strongest markets in the U.S. proved resilient. In 2020, we saw continued improvement in both the percentage of ABR coming from essential retailers and grocery-anchored centers. Growing the portfolio from 77% of ABR from grocery-anchored properties to 85% plus remains a strategic focus across the organization. 
We are encouraged by the progress and the increasing level of opportunities in the pipeline we are currently evaluating. As part of these efforts, we are pleased to share today the upcoming opening of Amazon Fresh at our marketplace at Factoria in Bellevue, Washington. During the fourth quarter, we executed 92 new leases, totaling 406,000 square feet, which exceeded the amount achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. The the true test of a portfolio's quality and durability is leasing and the ability to drive rent. To that point, new leasing spreads remained positive, rising 6.8% during the fourth quarter. We anticipate that our range between economic and physical occupancy will continue to widen as a precursor to future cash flow growth. With the help of our nationwide network of relationships, tenants, brokers and our in-house team we are experiencing robust demand from our essential retailers who continue to take advantage of the COVID surge that allows them to boost cash reserves, invest in the existing stores and expand their store portfolio to better serve their customers. We are also laser-focused on keeping our existing tenants and continue to do everything we can to help them overcome the pandemic and to be positioned to process our tenant assistance program, or TAP, helps small businesses navigate the new round of PPP funding. After successfully helping our small shop tenants navigate the first round of PPP funding, we believe we have aligned with best-in-class partners to continue to aid our small business tenants and accessing capital at their most critical time of need. Our strong balance sheet, well positioned portfolio and tenant initiatives are all the result of our best-in-class team and approach. Specifically, our leasing team was proactive in its efforts to work with current and prospective tenants and our Finance, Planning, Technology, Investor Relations And legal teams effectively navigated numerous obstacles and kept us focused without skipping a beat. So where do we go from here? First, our highest priority is leasing, leasing, leasing. The good news is we have visible growth in the portfolio and meaningful free cash flow to fund our leasing strategy. This has provided us the confidence to provide an outlook for 2021. We anticipate the first half of the year to remain challenging, especially for those categories dramatically impacted by the pandemic induced shutdowns. It is worth highlighting that our team pushed this portfolio to all-time high occupancies pre-pandemic, and we are determined to get back to that level and exceed it. While anticipating the speed at which we will recover NOI is challenging, we do expect rents to hold up, especially in our well-located boxes that are in high demand from categories that include grocery, off-price, home goods, home improvement, furniture, health, wellness, medical and beauty. Interesting to note, we are starting thho experience a rebound in both restaurant demand and value fitness retailers. Finally, on our long-term strategic focus, we continue to believe that streamlining the portfolio over the past 5 years will result in meaningful long-term value creation for our shareholders. We are focused on the highest and best use of our real estate and believe the 80/20 rule applies to our assets and gives us tremendous flexibility and adaptability to create value in the future through our entitlement initiative. Specifically, 80% of our real estate consists of parking lots that are not generating any revenue and 20% is single-story building. With our focus on clustering our assets in dense areas with significant barriers to entry, our assets are in ideal position for growth as the surrounding areas of own vertical. Our entitlement team is sharing our ESG accomplishments with all local municipalities as part of our efforts to show that we will be good stewards of their neighborhood and that we want to work together to make sure our assets continue to evolve alongside the community. We believe it is important that our approach to real estate evolve with changing circumstances because that is exactly what our tenants are doing. The best-in-class tenants are looking at their real estate differently. And in many cases, their real estate team is now integrated into the entire supply chain, distribution, fulfillment, e-commerce and store decisions are all integrated on how to best service the customer. 
The store, which is optimized for distribution and fulfillment continues to shine as the most economic way to get goods and services into customers' hands. Best Buy CEO, Corie Barry, at the CES conference was very clear when she said, physical stores are expected to play a massive role in the company's fulfillment effort. Target also stated that more than 95% of sales are fulfilled by its stores. I continue to share the words from our largest tenant. The role of the physical store is poised to become broader than ever with the locations serving as fulfillment epicenters that quickly and easily get customers whatever they need. Put another way, convergence of retail and industrials accelerate, and we are positioning the Kimco portfolio to take advantage of this new utilization by partnering with our retailers to ensure that Kimco assets are all optimized to gain market share and to make the stores of Kimco even more valuable. In closing, Kimco's open air grocery-anchored portfolio provides consumers a safe and easily accessible destination for goods and services. Our diverse tenant mix and targeted geographic presence in the strongest growth markets, supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and our entrepreneurial approach, positions us to unlock value for all stakeholders in the years to come. With that, I turn the call over to Ross."
320371,696492312,2205718,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Conor, and good morning. As Conor discussed,  2020 was a challenging year, but there are signs of life in the transactions market with deal flow starting to pick back up. The overall transaction volumes from March through year-end were down clo",526,"Thank you, Conor, and good morning. As Conor discussed,  2020 was a challenging year, but there are signs of life in the transactions market with deal flow starting to pick back up. The overall transaction volumes from March through year-end were down close to 85%, but there were several late 2020 deals that showcase the general theme we have seen occurring. The majority of transactions have been with essential based retail anchors, notably grocery. For the most part, size is good, but too big can result in the inability to finance the large or nonessential based tenancy, thus requiring a much bigger equity check for those deals. For the smaller grocery assets, the financing community has remained resilient. But again, rent rolling cash flow uncertainty for the chunkier assets have made those a bit more challenging. Multiple grocery anchor deals have transacted at subminus 6% cap rates in Denver, South Florida, California, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and throughout the major primary and secondary markets in the U.S. while we are bullish on that asset type, which represents the core product within our portfolio, there is no shortage of capital chasing those deals. 
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, the limited supply of attractively priced, high-quality assets versus our current cost of capital, has led us to tailor our investment program. As it relates to our structured investments program, we made 2 small investments on a pair of very high-quality shopping centers during the quarter. A $25 million mezzanine financing on a strong South Florida shopping center and a $10 million preferred equity investment on a densely located center in Queens New York, both of which will generate an accretive return versus our cost of capital with a chance to possibly acquire in the future. Additionally, as we have done many times, recently, we were able to leverage our strong tenant relationships, particularly with those that are real estate rich to uncover another unique investment that represents significant dislocation and value. To that point, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we acquired 2 Rite Aid distribution centers in California for approximately $85 million. These distribution centers service all   540   plus stores for the pharmacy chain in the state of California. Rite Aid is re-leasing these back on a long-term basis with annual rent bumps and 0 landlord obligation. This investment will provide an attractive return with an IRR well excess in of our cost of capital and enhanced NAV for the company. We continue to evaluate new opportunities selectively and believe our tenant relationships, flexible structuring and conviction in our product type, puts us in an enviable position to capture upside in a period of dislocation. This is an important long-term complement to our business with the 1 constant being our approach of owning high-quality assets at a positive spread to our current cost of capital while mitigating potential downside risk. Furthermore, we believe this approach will create a future pipeline of opportunistic acquisitions with the right of first refusal or right of first offer when our cost of capital returns. With that, I will pass it along to Glenn for the financial summary."
320371,696492312,2205718,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. With our   fourth   quarter operating results, we delivered further improvement compared to the sequential third quarter with higher rent collections and improvement in credit loss. For the fourth quarter of 2020, NAREIT FF",820,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. With our   fourth   quarter operating results, we delivered further improvement compared to the sequential third quarter with higher rent collections and improvement in credit loss. For the fourth quarter of 2020, NAREIT FFO was $133 million or   $0.31   per diluted share as compared to $151.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019. The reduction was mainly due to rent abatements and increased credit loss of $21.2 million and lower net recovery income of $5.7 million. This reduction was offset by lower preferred dividends of $3.1 million and a $7.2 million charge for the redemption of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Now although not included in NAREIT FFO, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did record a   $150.1   million unrealized gain on the mark-to-market of our marketable securities, which was primarily driven by the change in value of our [Audio Gap] million valued in excess of $650 million today. For the full year 2020, NAREIT FFO was $503.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share as compared to $608.4 million or $1.44 per diluted share for the prior year. The change was primarily due to increases in rent abatements, credit loss and straight-line reserves aggregating $105.8 million, and the NOI impact of disposition activity during 2019 and 2020, totaling $24.7 million. In addition, during 2020, we incurred a $7.5 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt. These reductions were offset by lower financing costs of $15.7 million and an $18.5 million charge for the redemption of $575 million of preferred stock during 2019. Although we continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic, our operating portfolio has shown signs of improvement, as Conor discussed earlier. All our shopping centers remain open and over 97% of our tenants are open and operating. Collections have continued to improve. We collected 92% of fourth quarter base rents, and this compares to third quarter collections of 90%. Deferrals granted during the fourth quarter were just under 2%, down from 5% during the third quarter. At year-end 2020, 8.2% of our annual base rents were from tenants on a cash basis of accounting and 50% of that has been collected. As of year-end, our total uncollectible reserve was $80.1 million or 46% of our total pro rata share of outstanding accounts receivable. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the   fourth   quarter with consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA of 7.1x, and on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of JV debt and preferred stock outstanding  to level of 7.9x. This represents further progress from the 7.6x and 8.5x levels reported last quarter, with the improvement attributable to lower credit loss. On a pro forma basis, if our albertsons investment was converted to cash, these metrics would improve by a full turn to 6.1x and 7x, respectively, levels than better we began last year. We ended 2020 with a strong liquidity position, comprised of over $290 million in cash and $2 billion available on our untapped revolving credit facility. We have only $140 million of consolidated mortgage debt maturing during 2021, and our next bond does not mature until November 2022. Our consolidated weighted average net maturity profile stood at 10.9 years, 1 of the longest in the REIT industry. In addition, our unsecured bond credit spreads have improved significantly. By way of example, our 10-year green bond issued in July 2020 at 210 basis points over the 10-year treasury is currently trading in the area of 90 basis points over treasury. This spread is the lowest among all our peers. 
Regarding our common dividend, we paid a fourth quarter 2020 common dividend of   $0.16   per share. As such, we expect our Board of Directors to declare the common dividend during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a more normalized level that at least equals our expected 2021 taxable income. 
Now for guidance. While the pandemic and its effects on certain of our tenants continues, we are comfortable establishing NAREIT FFO per share guidance for 2021. Our initial NAREIT FFO per share guidance range is $1.18 to $1.24. This is also a wider range than we have provided historically, taking into account the potential variability of credit loss levels due to the ongoing pandemic. Other assumptions include flat to modestly higher corporate financing costs and G&A expenses as well as minimal net neutral acquisition and disposition activity. This 2021 guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense, no monetization of our albertsons investment and no additional common equity issued. Lastly, keep in mind that our 2021 first quarter results will be relative to a precoded first quarter in 2020. Notwithstanding the expected optics of the first quarter results, our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range of $1.18 to $1.24 reflects growth over 2020 at both the low and high-end of the range. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

So we are still -- we've baked into this guidance, still another $80 million to $100 million for this year. So that's a component of what's in there. The other thing that I want to bring out also is we do have less interest capitalization because of the projects that have come online.

So people are starting to prepare. Investors are starting to prepare for what that will look like and how do they set up their business accordingly. And again, on the nonessential side, we say not essential, but when you think of the performance, especially with the investment-grade retailers and how well they've done from a public standpoint through this pandemic from a stock share price, they're really on sound footing and see this opportunity to their expand market share. And again, enter into higher quality portfolios, knowing that, that window will only be open for a limited time. So we're cautiously optimistic about the future here."

I can't tell you how many conversations I've had about what restaurants people are going to go to or what fitness club they're going to go back to or what trips they're going to take.

Look, you've seen in our supplemental that we've added the entitlements that we've achieved over the past 5 years. And we believe there's a lot of value to be created on our asset base just on the entitlement initiative. And then what we look through is the decision tree of how to activate those entitlements. And what we've done over the past 5 years is we've sold some entitlements. We've ground leased some entitlements, and we've joint ventured some entitlements to unlock that value. And depending on our cost of capital, depending on the supply and demand in that trade area, we really look at the spread to our ROI, what the exit cap would be and trying to have a 200 basis point spread there between what we believe we can deliver the project at and what we could sell the project at. And so Pentagon, obviously, is the 1 where we feel like there's a pretty unique set of circumstances there. If you haven't seen the Amazon rendering of the Helix and what they're doing right across the street from our Pentagon Center, it's going to be pretty dramatic. And with the success of the Whitmer and some of the cap rates that have traded in that trade area, we feel very comfortable with adding that to the pipeline in a joint venture. It's with CPP. We have a very solid multifamily experts that helped us with the first tower that's also helping on the second tower. And we feel like that's the right project to add to the pipeline. But going forward, we're going to be very selective. We do like the initiative of ground leasing a lot of our entitlements. We feel like that's the way to not have a significant amount of capital tied up into these larger scale projects. But we love the smaller scale projects that are double-digit type returns. Where you're adding an out parcel or a pad with a drive-thru or expanding an existing tenant. Those are ones that typically run in the range of $75 million to $100 million a year and have that double-digit type return. So you'll see that being consistent. But we will be mindful of how much we add to the pipeline going forward and be very selective on that."

I think when we have open dialogue with our retailers, they are looking at their real estate differently, and they're seeing their store base as a distribution fulfillment point that can solve for the last mile. The last mile is something that's been tried to be cracked now for a number of years. And with BOPUS, with curbside pickup, you have to have that amenity available to your customer to offer a suite of services. But what's being unlocked, I think, is the store is being optimized to service that last mile in more ways than 1. And you're seeing the changes being made primarily from the best-in-class retailers as they set the blueprint for others to follow. But it is very clear when you look at who are the most successful retailers are but the store is being utilized as that last mile fulfillment point. And I wouldn't be surprised if you start to see more incentives for customers to drive to the store because the margin is higher there, and they can take advantage of that by incentivizing them with coupons that really can get people to take control over when they want the good, how they want the good and it does drive up margin for the retailer.

So when you look at the Rite Aid transaction, I would just point to sort of the history of our plus business. And the fact that we have taken advantage of sale-leaseback opportunities many times in the past. Most recently, obviously, the Albertsons investment, where a smaller component of that transaction that maybe doesn't get the same level of of showcases, the bigger investment is that we were able to acquire several of their grocery stores within shopping centers that we controlled, where we didn't have the grocer. Dating a little bit further back, we had a very successful transaction with Winn-Dixie. Where we acquired 5 of their freestanding locations and 1 shop center that they owned. And subsequently, we sold off 4 of those at pretty significant profit and held on to the shopping center in the Florida Keys, which is a redevelopment asset as well as a freestanding 1 in Miami, which is now slated for future redevelopment and potentially Density. So when we look at the specifics of the Rite Aid transaction, we're in constant communication with our retailers, particularly those that are real estate rich, helping them provide, I would say, solutions for some of their liquidity needs or desires. And when this opportunity presented itself, while I can't get too much into the economics of it because we're bound by confidentiality, I can tell you that directionally, the cap rate that we were able to negotiate is significantly higher than the core grocery products that we're seeing transact in this market. When we look at the cap rate here, it's substantially higher than the other distribution centers that we're seeing trading in the state of California. And lastly, I would just say that we are holding it in our TRS, which provides us sort of the maximum flexibility in terms of our hold period in our exit strategy. So I'm not suggesting that this is sort of a wide-ranging opportunity, but selectively, we do like to take advantage when those opportunities present themselves."

The anchor side of it never really been flowed. it Was Pretty consistent through the pandemic as most of our essential retailers saw a lot of market share up for grab and improving their portfolio by locating in high-quality assets that weren't typically available to them before. I do think that the big change that we've experienced is on the small shop side. And that's what's really, I think, is going to continue to improve the spread between physical and economic occupancy as we go through the year. I think historically, we were noted Glenn, probably around 275 basis points wise between those 2. I wouldn't be surprised if we eclipse that. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit   300   million just because I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, a lot of market share up for grab. And when you look at how retailers are thinking about this, the deals they're signing today are really more like 6 to 12 months out before they open. And so they feel like now is the time to grab market share so that when the reopening occurs, they're in the best position possible to soak up that market share.

So there's about $8 million to $10 million less of capitalized interest in 2021, baked into the guidance versus 2020. G&A also was relatively stable.

Do you feel like, basically, let's call it, half of those folks will pay and be good? The other half to 3% will go tapioca? Or do you feel -- like where do you feel -- because ultimately, that's the real question that we're all getting at is you're sitting here, we know there's going to be residuals, but it would also seem like right now, you have a pretty good handle on which tenants are going to make it and which tenants you got your guys ready to you know to lock the store."

I mean if you look at what happened with AMC that was pretty remarkable to see the stock run-up and have them take advantage of it. And so I think that you have to go tenant by tenant, which we can do off-line. But a lot of it comes down to the categories that were most impacted that are still closed. Or they still have significant capacity constraints. And how quickly can they get reopened? How quickly can they come back to full capacity, those are all questions that are really hard to answer because it all depends on things that are outside of our control. And so when you look at how we've approached it, our mentality is, if a retailer has kept their lights on, through this pandemic to this point, it's our responsibility to try and help them make it through this last phase of it. And hopefully, this is the last phase of it. And so that's the way we're approaching it. And we're trying to make sure we work with those tenants that have put their best foot forward to throw everything at staying afloat. And it's luckily that Kimco is a big partner with a lot of these retailers that can help them and navigate the PPP funding round, can structure leases to give them the breathing room to hopefully make it through. But it is a tenant by tenant approach that we have done that really takes into account the category that they're in, the capacity constraints that they're facing, potentially the product that they're waiting to get if it's blockbuster movies. So all these things are really components that make up the assumptions that come to our guidance range that we feel comfortable disclosing and feel like it's our job to exceed it."

We probably work with them on extending out that deferment start date, and that could be in process now and just not yet papered. So that's not uncommon in some of these situations. While in others, we're working out what would make a reasonable agreement between both parties where we get some additional flexibility within their existing lease to reposition, redevelop parts of the center, and we're still negotiating that.

Some people look at bookending a trade area and while others look to saturate it with multiple stores. Ross has a double down strategy where they will -- in their higher productive markets, they'll look to put stores almost across the street from 1 another. So it really just depends on where they are in terms of their fleet strategy and how it complements how they view trade areas and grabbing market share.

So I wouldn't necessarily break it down in terms of a trend in terms of location, geographics or property type. It is sort of a specific circumstance of that individual owner or investor."

When we see the grocery opportunity, it's, first and foremost, being led by the demand we're seeing from all the different grocery categories that Dave outlined. It's interesting. There's a big cap rate difference when you have a grocery anchor versus when you don't. And we have a lot of products that lends itself to just leasing up boxes to grocery stores, which, in my opinion, is the best risk-adjusted return we can find today. And so that's where our focus is. And we have these deep relationships with these retailers that are looking to expand. And so we have, I think, a deep pipeline of opportunity there that we want to take advantage of. And that may lend itself to acquisitions as well in the future. Where we can buy assets that don't necessarily have a grocery component, but we have the connections, and we have the wherewithal to sort of line up that grocer before we even close on that asset. So it does compress the cap rate. It does start to generate some additional traffic flow, some cross-shopping that usually leads to higher rents in the surrounding spaces, and that's the secret sauce. You want to sort of get that lift without paying for it. So we are encouraged by what we're seeing so far. We have a lot of work to do, but we feel like the strategy and the focus is there across the organization. 
On your second question between lifestyle and grocery anchored, like Lifestyle is sort of the dynamics that got hit hardest from the pandemic, right? If you think about lifestyle, it's usually heavily loaded with restaurants and entertainment, and most of those leases are percentage rent driven. And so you sort of live and breathe with the success of your retailers. And so in the best of days, you're killing it and the worse today is, you're taking it on the chin just like they are. So it's 1 of those product types that I think is very volatile. It's not very essential and defensive. But there's opportunity there if you can underwrite it correctly. I'm not sure we're going to be playing in the pool of lifestyle centers, but we'd like to underwrite everything just to get a sense of where we think we can add value. And maybe lifestyle portions of lifestyle centers lend themselves to a repositioning to a grocery-anchored center or maybe some of them can be unlocked for future densification through entitlement work. So that's where our platform really comes and has value as we feel like we can look at the real estate and not necessarily just judge it on the way it sits today, but try and what envision should be there with the blanks late. And then have our team go and unlock that highest and best use in that value for our shareholders. And so that's the way we look at real estate."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I will begin by giving a quick overview of our accomplishments in 2020 and our strategic focus for 2021 and beyond, Ross will follow with updates on transactions, and Glenn will close with our key metrics and guidance for 2021. 
For all of us, 2020 was a year that will not soon be forgotten. COVID, the political landscape, social unrests and the responses to these events all converged in a way that will forever change our way of life. 2020 was also a year that demonstrated in volatile times, the best companies are the ones that are able to withstand economic challenges, mitigate risk and take advantage of opportunities. In the shopping center sector, this requires a strong balance sheet, a resilient, well-located portfolio and a superior management team. I am happy to report that while we are not immune to the volatility of 2020, Kimco's open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets performed well, and we have stayed strong, confident and positive about the opportunity in the coming year. 
Our portfolio withstood all that the pandemic threw at us as our 2020 vision strategy to reposition our portfolio was validated. Our grocery-anchored essential services and mixed-use assets concentrated in the strongest markets in the U.S. proved resilient. In 2020, we saw continued improvement in both the percentage of ABR coming from essential retailers and grocery-anchored centers. Growing the portfolio from 77% of ABR from grocery-anchored properties to 85% plus remains a strategic focus across the organization. We are encouraged by the progress and the increasing level of opportunities in the pipeline we are currently evaluating. As part of these efforts, we are pleased to share today the upcoming opening of Amazon Fresh at our marketplace at Factoria in Bellevue, Washington. 
During the fourth quarter, we executed 92 new leases, totaling 406,000 square feet, which exceeded the amount achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. The true test of a portfolio's quality and durability is leasing and the ability to drive rent. To that point, new leasing spreads remained positive, rising 6.8% during the fourth quarter. We anticipate that our range between economic and physical occupancy will continue to widen as a precursor to future cash flow growth. With the help of our nationwide network of relationships, tenants, brokers and our in-house team, we are experiencing robust demand from our essential retailers who continue to take advantage of the COVID surge that allows them to boost cash reserves, invest in the existing stores and expand their store portfolio to better serve their customers. We are also laser-focused on keeping our existing tenants and continue to do everything we can to help them overcome the pandemic and to be positioned to profit. 
Our tenant assistance program, or TAP, helps small businesses navigate the new round of PPP funding. After successfully helping our small shop tenants navigate the first round of PPP funding, we believe we have aligned with best-in-class partners to continue to aid our small business tenants accessing capital at their most critical time of need. Our strong balance sheet, well-positioned portfolio and tenant initiatives are all the result of our best-in-class team and approach. Specifically, our leasing team was proactive in its efforts to work with current and prospective tenants and our Finance, Planning, Technology, Investor Relations and legal teams effectively navigated numerous obstacles and kept us focused without skipping a beat. 
So where do we go from here? First, our highest priority is leasing, leasing, leasing. The good news is we have visible growth in the portfolio and meaningful free cash flow to fund our leasing strategy. This has provided us the confidence to provide an outlook for 2021. We anticipate the first half of the year to remain challenging, especially for those categories dramatically impacted by the pandemic-induced shutdowns. It is worth highlighting that our team pushed this portfolio to all-time high occupancies pre-pandemic, and we are determined to get back to that level and exceed it. While anticipating the speed at which we will recover NOI is challenging, we do expect rents to hold up, especially in our well-located boxes that are in high demand from categories that include grocery, off-price, home goods, home improvement, furniture, health, wellness, medical and beauty. Interesting to note, we are starting to experience a rebound in both restaurant demand and value fitness retailers.
Finally, on our long-term strategic focus, we continue to believe that streamlining the portfolio over the past 5 years will result in meaningful long-term value creation for our shareholders. We are focused on the highest and best use of our real estate and believe the 80/20 rule applies to our assets and gives us tremendous flexibility and adaptability to create value in the future through our entitlement initiative. Specifically, 80% of our real estate consists of parking lots that are not generating any revenue and 20% is single-story building. With our focus on clustering our assets in dense areas with significant barriers to entry, our assets are in ideal position for growth as the surrounding areas have gone vertical. Our entitlement team is sharing our ESG accomplishments with all local municipalities as part of our efforts to show that we will be good stewards of their neighborhoods and that we want to work together to make sure our assets continue to evolve alongside the community. We believe it is important that our approach to real estate evolve with changing circumstances because that is exactly what our tenants are doing. 
The best-in-class tenants are looking at their real estate differently. And in many cases, their real estate team is now integrated in the entire supply chain, distribution, fulfillment, e-commerce and store decisions are all integrated on how to best service the customer. The store, which is optimized for distribution and fulfillment, continues to shine as the most economic way to get goods and services into customers' hands. Best Buy CEO, Corie Barry at the CES conference was very clear when she said, physical stores are expected to play a massive role in the company's fulfillment effort. Target also stated that more than 95% of sales are fulfilled by its stores. I continue to share the words from our largest tenants. The role of the physical store is poised to become broader than ever with the locations serving as fulfillment epicenters that quickly and easily get customers whatever they need. Put another way, the convergence of retail and industrials accelerate, and we are positioning the Kimco portfolio to take advantage of this new utilization by partnering with our retailers to ensure that Kimco assets are all optimized to gain market share and to make the stores of Kimco even more valuable.
In closing, Kimco's open-air, grocery-anchored portfolio provides consumers a safe and easily accessible destination for goods and services. Our diverse tenant mix and targeted geographic presence in the strongest growth markets, supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and our entrepreneurial approach, positions us to unlock value for all stakeholders in the years to come. 
With that, I turn the call over to Ross."

As Conor discussed,  2020 was a challenging year, but there are signs of life in the transactions market with deal flow starting to pick back up. The overall transaction volumes from March through year-end were down close to 85%, but there were several late 2020 deals that showcase the general theme we have seen occurring. The majority of transactions have been with essential-based retail anchors, notably grocery. For the most part, size is good, but too big can result in the inability to finance the large or nonessential-based tenancy, thus requiring a much bigger equity check for those deals. For the smaller grocery assets, the financing community has remained resilient. But again, rent rolling cash flow uncertainty for the chunkier assets have made those a bit more challenging. Multiple grocery-anchored deals have transacted at sub 6% cap rates in Denver, South Florida, California, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and throughout the major primary and secondary markets in the U.S. While we are bullish on that asset type, which represents the core product within our portfolio, there is no shortage of capital chasing those deals. 
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, the limited supply of attractively priced, high-quality assets versus our current cost of capital has led us to tailor our investment program. As it relates to our structured investments program, we made 2 small investments on a pair of very high quality shopping centers during the quarter. A $25 million mezzanine financing on a strong South Florida shopping center and a $10 million preferred equity investment on a densely located center in Queens, New York, both of which will generate an accretive return versus our cost of capital with a chance to possibly acquire in the future. 
Additionally, as we have done many times, recently, we were able to leverage our strong tenant relationships, particularly with those that are real estate rich, to uncover another unique investment that represents significant dislocation in value. To that point, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction in which we acquired 2 Rite Aid distribution centers in California for approximately $85 million. These distribution centers service all 540-plus stores for the pharmacy chain in the state of California. Rite Aid is re-leasing these back on a long-term basis with annual rent bumps and 0 landlord obligation. This investment will provide an attractive return with an IRR well excess in of our cost of capital and enhanced NAV for the company. 
We continue to evaluate new opportunities selectively and believe our tenant relationships, flexible structuring and conviction in our product type puts us in an enviable position to capture upside in a period of dislocation. This is an important long-term complement to our business with the one constant being our approach of owning high-quality assets at a positive spread to our current cost of capital while mitigating potential downside risk. Furthermore, we believe this approach will create a future pipeline of opportunistic acquisitions with the right of first refusal or right of first offer when our cost of capital returns. 
With that, I will pass it along to Glenn for the financial summary."
320371,696492312,2207256,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. With our fourth quarter operating results, we delivered further improvement compared to the sequential third quarter with higher rent collections and improvement in credit loss. For the fourth quarter 2020, NAREIT FFO was $",828,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. With our fourth quarter operating results, we delivered further improvement compared to the sequential third quarter with higher rent collections and improvement in credit loss. For the fourth quarter 2020, NAREIT FFO was $133 million or $0.31 per diluted share as compared to $151.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019. The reduction was mainly due to rent abatements and increased credit loss of $21.2 million and lower net recovery income of $5.7 million. This reduction was offset by lower preferred dividends of $3.1 million and a $7.2 million charge for the redemption of preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Now although not included in NAREIT FFO, during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did record a $150.1 million unrealized gain on the mark-to-market of our marketable securities, which was primarily driven by the change in value of our $39.8 million shares of Albertsons stock. Our stake in Albertsons is valued in excess of $650 million today. For the full year 2020, NAREIT FFO was $503.7 million or $1.17 per diluted share as compared to $608.4 million or $1.44 per diluted share for the prior year. The change was primarily due to increases in rent abatements, credit loss and straight-line reserves aggregating $105.8 million, and the NOI impact of disposition activity during 2019 and 2020 totaling $24.7 million. 
In addition, during 2020, we incurred a $7.5 million charge for the early extinguishment of debt. These reductions were offset by lower financing costs of $15.7 million and an $18.5 million charge for the redemption of $575 million of preferred stock during 2019. Although we continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic, our operating portfolio has shown signs of improvement, as Conor discussed earlier. All our shopping centers remain open and over 97% of our tenants are open and operating. Collections have continued to improve. We collected 92% of fourth quarter base rents and this compares to third quarter collections of 90%. Deferrals granted during the fourth quarter were just under 2%, down from 5% during the third quarter. At year-end 2020, 8.2% of our annual base rents were from tenants on a cash basis of accounting and 50% of that has been collected. As of year-end, our total uncollectible reserve was $80.1 million or 46% of our total pro rata share of outstanding accounts receivable. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA of 7.1x, and on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of JV debt and preferred stock outstanding, to level of 7.9x. This represents further progress from the 7.6x and 8.5x levels reported last quarter, with the improvement attributable to lower credit loss. On a pro forma basis, if our Albertsons investment was converted to cash, these metrics would improve by a full turn to 6.1x and 7x, respectively, levels better than we began last year. 
We ended 2020 with a strong liquidity position comprised of over $290 million in cash and $2 billion available on our untapped revolving credit facility. We have only $140 million of consolidated mortgage debt maturing during 2021, and our next bond does not mature until November 2022. Our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile stood at 10.9 years, one of the longest in the REIT industry. In addition, our unsecured bond credit spreads have improved significantly. By way of example, our 10-year green bond issued in July 2020 at 210 basis points over the 10-year treasury is currently trading in the area of 90 basis points over treasury. This spread is the lowest among all our peers. 
Regarding our common dividend, we paid a fourth quarter 2020 common dividend of $0.15 per share. As such, we expect our Board of Directors to declare the common dividend during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a more normalized level that at least equals our expected 2021 taxable income. 
Now for guidance. While the pandemic and its effects on certain of our tenants continues, we are comfortable establishing NAREIT FFO per share guidance for 2021. Our initial NAREIT FFO per share guidance range is $1.18 to $1.24. This is also a wider range than we have historically provided, taking into account the potential variability of credit loss levels due to the ongoing pandemic. Other assumptions include flat to modestly higher corporate financing costs and G&A expenses as well as minimal net neutral acquisition and disposition activity. This 2021 guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense, no monetization of our Albertsons investment and no additional common equity issued. 
Lastly, keep in mind that our 2021 first quarter results will be relative to a pre-COVID first quarter in 2020. Notwithstanding the expected optics of the first quarter results, our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range of $1.18 to $1.24 reflects growth over 2020 at both the low and high end of the range. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

So we are still -- we've baked into this guidance still another $80 million to $100 million for this year. So that's a component of what's in there. The other thing that I want to bring out also is we do have less interest capitalization because of the projects that have come online.

And when you look at the velocity in Q4 2020, I thought that was a really encouraging sign from a lease-up standpoint and what we're currently seeing as we move through Q1 is that the momentum is continuing to build. So I think the one good thing is that the vaccine has provided some endpoint, the idea that at some point and hopefully, the not-too-distant future, we'll see this pandemic somewhat behind us. So people are starting to prepare. Investors are starting to prepare for what that will look like and how do they set up their business accordingly.

Look, we have seen in our supplemental that we've added the entitlements that we've achieved over the past 5 years. And we believe there's a lot of value to be created on our asset base just on the entitlement initiative. And then what we look through is the decision tree of how to activate those entitlements. And what we've done over the past 5 years is we've sold some entitlements, we've ground leased some entitlements, and we've joint ventured some entitlements to unlock that value. And depending on our cost of capital, depending on the supply and demand in that trade area, we really look at the spread to our ROI, what the exit cap would be and trying to have a 200 basis point spread there between what we believe we can deliver the project at and what we could sell the project at. And so Pentagon, obviously, is the one where we feel like there's a pretty unique set of circumstances there. If you haven't seen the Amazon rendering of the Helix and what they're doing right across the street from our Pentagon Center, it's going to be pretty dramatic. 
And with the success of the Whittler and some of the cap rates that have traded in that trade area, we feel very comfortable with adding that to the pipeline. In a joint venture, it's with CPP, we have a very solid multifamily experts that helped us with the first tower that's also helping on the second tower. And we feel like that's the right project to add to the pipeline. But going forward, we're going to be very selective. We do like the initiative of ground leasing a lot of our entitlements. We feel like that's the way to not have a significant amount of capital tied up into these larger-scale projects. But we love the smaller-scale projects that are double-digit-type returns, where you're adding an out parcel or a pad with a drive-thru or expanding an existing tenant. Those are ones that typically run in the range of $75 million to $100 million a year and have that double-digit-type return. So you'll see that being consistent.

What's the driver besides COVID? Is it that fulfillment is easier at the local store level?

I think when we have open dialogue with our retailers, they are looking at their real estate differently, and they're seeing their store base as a distribution fulfillment point that can solve for the last mile. The last mile is something that's been tried to be cracked now for a number of years. And with BOPIS, with curbside pickup, you have to have that amenity available to your customer to offer a suite of services. But what's being unlocked, I think, is the stores being optimized to service that last mile in more ways than one. And you're seeing the changes being made primarily from the best-in-class retailers as they set the blueprint for others to follow. But it is very clear when you look at who the most successful retailers are but the store is being utilized as that last mile fulfillment point. And I wouldn't be surprised if you start to see more incentives for customers to drive to the store because the margin is higher there, and they can take advantage of that by incentivizing them with coupons or other offers that really can get people to take control over when they want the good, how they want the good, and it does drive up margin for the retailer. So they're looking at it very differently."

So when you look at the Rite Aid transaction, I would just point to sort of the history of our PLUS business. And the fact that we have taken advantage of sale-leaseback opportunities many times in the past, most recently, obviously, the Albertsons investment, where a smaller component of that transaction that maybe doesn't get the same level of showcases. The bigger investment is that we were able to acquire several of their grocery stores within shopping centers that we controlled, where we didn't have the grocer. Dating a little bit further back, we had a very successful transaction with Winn-Dixie, where we acquired 5 of their freestanding locations and one shopping center that they owned. And subsequently, we sold off 4 of those at pretty significant profit and held on to the shopping center in the Florida Keys, which is a redevelopment asset, as well as a freestanding one in Miami, which is now slated for future redevelopment and potentially density. 
So when we look at the specifics of the Rite Aid transaction, we're in constant communication with our retailers, particularly those that are real estate rich, helping them provide, I would say, solutions for some of their liquidity needs or desires. And when this opportunity presented itself, while I can't get too much into the economics of it because we're bound by confidentiality, I can tell you that directionally, the cap rate that we were able to negotiate is significantly higher than the core grocery products that we're seeing transact in this market. When we look at the cap rate here, it's substantially higher than the other distribution centers that we're seeing trading in the state of California. And lastly, I would just say that we are holding it in our TRS, which provides us sort of the maximum flexibility in terms of our hold period and our exit strategy. So I'm not suggesting that this is sort of a wide-ranging opportunity, but selectively, we do like to take advantage when those opportunities present themselves."

What we're seeing is the demand continuing, as Dave had mentioned earlier. The anchor side of it never really ebbed and flowed. It was pretty consistent through the pandemic as most of our essential retailers saw a lot of market share up for grab and improving their portfolio by locating in high-quality assets that weren't typically available to them before. I do think that the big change that we've experienced is on the small shop side. And that's what's really, I think, going to continue to improve the spread between physical and economic occupancy as we go through the year. I think historically, we were, what is it, Glenn, probably around 275 basis points wide between those 2. I wouldn't be surprised if we eclipse that. I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 300 just because I think there's a lot of pent-up demand, a lot of market share up for grab. And when you look at how retailers are thinking about this, the deals they're signing today are really more like 6 to 12 months out before they open. And so they feel like now is the time to grab market share so that when the reopening occurs, they're in the best position possible to soak up that market share. So we feel like with the transformed portfolio, we're in really good shape to have that spread widen out to potentially its all-time high."

That was pretty remarkable to see the stock run-up and have them take advantage of it. And so I think that you have to go tenant by tenant, which we can do off-line. But a lot of it comes down to the categories that were most impacted that are still closed, right, or they still have significant capacity constraints. And how quickly can they get reopened? How quickly can they come back to full capacity? Those are all questions that are really hard to answer because it all depends on things that are outside of our control. And so when you look at how we've approached it, our mentality is, if a retailer has kept their lights on through this pandemic to this point, it's our responsibility to try and help them make it through this last phase of it. And hopefully, this is the last phase of it. And so that's the way we're approaching it. 
And we're trying to make sure we work with those tenants that have put their best foot forward to throw everything at staying afloat. And it's luckily that Kimco is a big partner with a lot of these retailers that can help them and navigate the PPP funding round, can structure leases to give them the breathing room to hopefully make it through. But it is a tenant-by-tenant approach that we have done that really takes into account the category that they're in, the capacity constraints that they're facing, potentially the product that they're waiting to get if it's blockbuster movies.

So it does vary as Conor mentioned, but it's not to say that in terms of uncollectible the tenants themselves are dark or they vacated. We could be working out a deal where we cut a deferment early on in the pandemic and had their collection start date in January, but say they're on the West Coast and they had to go through a second closing, which impacted their business more so than originally expected. We probably work with them on extending out that deferment start date, and that could be in process now and just not yet papered. So that's not uncommon in some of these situations. While in others, we're working out what would make a reasonable agreement between both parties where we get some additional flexibility within their existing lease to reposition, redevelop parts of the center, and we're still negotiating that. So I wouldn't by any means take that 6% and assume that they're dark or they vacated. It's not that. It is just an ongoing dialogue with the tenants there."

Sometimes, there is a retailer that has significant demand in one of their existing locations and so they're looking for a pressure valve to release some of that demand on one store.

Some people look at bookending a trade area while others look to saturate it with multiple stores. Ross has a double-down strategy where they will -- in their higher productive markets, they'll look to put stores almost across the street from one another. So it really just depends on where they are in terms of their fleet strategy and how it complements how they view trade areas and grabbing market share. 
And with the pandemic, what it's really done is accelerate I think a lot of the discussion that have been ongoing, whether it's curbside, BOPIS, distribution, last mile.

When we see the grocery opportunity, it's, first and foremost, being led by the demand we're seeing from all the different grocery categories that Dave outlined. It's interesting. There's a big cap rate difference when you have a grocery anchor versus when you don't. And we have a lot of products that lends itself to just leasing up boxes to grocery stores, which, in my opinion, is the best risk-adjusted return we can find today. And so that's where our focus is. And we have these deep relationships with these retailers that are looking to expand. And so we have, I think, a deep pipeline of opportunity there that we want to take advantage of. And that may lend itself to acquisitions as well in the future, where we can buy assets that don't necessarily have a grocery component, but we have the connections and we have the wherewithal to sort of line up that grocer before we even close on that asset. So it does compress the cap rate. It does start to generate some additional traffic flow, some cross-shopping that usually leads to higher rents in the surrounding spaces, and that's the secret sauce. You want to sort of get that lift without paying for it. So we are encouraged by what we're seeing so far. We have a lot of work to do, but we feel like the strategy and the focus is there across the organization. 
On your second question between lifestyle and grocery-anchored, like lifestyle is sort of the dynamic that got hit hardest from the pandemic, right? If you think about lifestyle, it's usually heavily loaded with restaurants and entertainment, and most of those leases are percentage rent driven. And so you sort of live and breathe with the success of your retailers. And so in the best of days, you're killing it and the worse of days, you're taking it on the chin just like they are. So it's one of those product types that I think is very volatile. It's not very essential and defensive. But there's opportunity there if you can underwrite it correctly. I'm not sure we're going to be playing in the pool of lifestyle centers, but we'd like to underwrite everything just to get a sense of where we think we can add value. And maybe lifestyle -- portions of lifestyle centers lend themselves to a repositioning to a grocery-anchored center or maybe some of them can be unlocked for future densification through entitlement work. So that's where our platform really comes and has value as we feel like we can look at the real estate and not necessarily just judge it on the way it sits today, but try and envision should be there with the blank slate and then have our team go and unlock that highest and best use and that value for our shareholders. And so that's the way we look at real estate."

So we've certainly been approached, and we know that there's underlying value in a lot of those leases.

It really is case by case, but I think it just does give retailers more opportunities to create touch points with their end customer.

Today, I will focus my remarks on our leasing results, the supply and demand dynamics surrounding those results and the exciting strategic direction we are taking the organization. Ross will cover the transaction market, and Glenn will cover the quarterly numbers and our updated guidance. 
2021 is off to a refreshing and good start with robust demand for space in our last mile open air, grocery-anchored portfolio, coming from both well capitalized omnichannel tenants seeking more market share as well as some smaller businesses that have regrouped and are prepared to reinvest in their business models. The largest leasing demand categories include: Restaurants, personal care, fitness and dollar stores. 
We also see healthy activity and have consummated multiple leases with grocery stores, off-price and pet supply retailers. Our leasing volume continued to build from the record-setting trend last quarter. Our new lease count was 121, totaling 586,000 square feet. This exceeds both last quarter and the prior year quarters of particular note, the 586,000 square feet of volume surpassed our 5-year first quarter average for new lease GLA of 506,000 square feet, and new lease spreads finished at a positive 8.2% pro rata. 
We closed the quarter with 237 renewals and options, totaling 2.2 million square feet with GLA exceeding the quarter sequentially and the prior year quarter. Renewals and option spreads finished at 6.4% pro rata. These spreads continue to reflect the recovery underway and the pricing power inherent in the quality of our portfolio. Conversely, our ability to outwith tod the impact of the pandemic reflects the defensive nature and strength of our recurring cash flows. 
From a supply and demand perspective, the reality is that due to the speed of the recovery, pandemic induced vacancies were short-lived. With limited new supply, market rents never adjusted down in any meaningful way. So when the demand snap back, we generated positive spreads. While our occupancy dipped slightly from year-end to 93.5%, and it strengthened as we move through the quarter. It is our intent to continue expanding occupancy, and we are encouraged by multiple demand factors playing to the strengths of our last mile locations. 
Our job is clear focus on the blocking and tackling of leasing, work with best-in-class retailers, enhance the merchandising mix and let the numbers speak to themselves as we strengthen the resiliency of our cash flows. Our first, second and third priorities are leasing, leasing, leasing. And we continue to believe we are in the early innings of this reopening and recovery. In addition to leasing, we are prioritizing our smaller redevelopments, that average double-digit returns to create an additional organic growth driver. 
Long term, we believe our entitlement program will continue to create shareholder value as we unlock the highest and best use of our real estate. The pandemic has both validated and strengthened our conviction in our strategic vision to concentrate our open air, grocery-anchored and mixed-use portfolio in the top MSAs across the country. Tenants no longer look at the last mile stores, simply a retail destination, rather, its value to retailers is now viewed holistically, providing distribution, fulfillment and retail. In valuing the location, retailers assess their ability to integrate e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar to give the customer what they demand, convenience, value and a fulfilling experience continues to point to the last mile shopping center as mission-critical for both consumers and retailers. 
Our platform is well positioned for growth. And with that growth will come further debt reductions and other benefits of scale. We are enthused about the opportunities ahead yet recognize the challenges involved. We remain committed to prioritizing ESG initiatives and supporting our tenants and local communities as we continue to navigate the pandemic and beyond. 
I'd also like to touch on the exciting recent news regarding our highly strategic merger with Weingarten, a transaction that we expect to unlock considerable value in some of the highest growth markets in the country. By coming together, we will be the nation's preeminent open air, grocery-anchored shopping center and mixed-use real estate platform. With our focus on these last mile locations and increased scale in our targeted high-growth Sunbelt markets, this transaction will significantly strengthen and enhance our portfolio quality to further gain market share and to make Kimco even more valuable to all of our tenants. 
In closing, Kimco's open air and grocery-anchored portfolio, diversed tenant mix, targeted geographic presence in the strongest growth markets in the country and improving balance sheet, provide us with a long runway for growth as we move ahead. Needless to say, the entire organization is generally energized by our efforts to build shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ross."

What a difference a quarter makes with continued recovery from the pandemic vaccination rollout and reduced capacity restrictions across the country, we have seen optimism building from retailers, consumers and real es",443,"Thank you, Connor, and good morning. What a difference a quarter makes with continued recovery from the pandemic vaccination rollout and reduced capacity restrictions across the country, we have seen optimism building from retailers, consumers and real estate investors at the highest level since the pandemic began almost 14 months ago. Specific to the transaction, industry volume, while still off nearly 40% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, has seen a meaningful uptick from the back half of 2020. 
The conviction and the stability of property rent rolls and by extension cash flows, has grown beyond only the essential retailers and now includes other categories that were much less clear previously. There is no doubt the grocery-anchored shopping center is still the most in-demand category of retail and continues to command the most aggressive pricing and lowest cap rates. 
Furthermore, Open Air is valued at an even higher premium. Recent transactions with more specialty and lifestyle components in addition to traditional power centers, have given transparency to the value and stability that our approach provides. Multiple grocery anchor deals have transacted at sub 6% cap rates in Dallas, South Florida, California, Philadelphia and Seattle, to name a few. There are also no signs of investor demand waning for that product type. We anticipate bidding to become even more aggressive as the spread of cap rate to interest rate remains wide for our asset class, particularly when compared to industrial, multifamily, self-storage and others. 
More recently, aggressive bidding, extending beyond the bread and butter neighborhood product is starting to emerge. Two recent deals that have a grocery store, but also a significant restaurant and entertainment component saw bidding wars with multiple rounds of offers and pricing well beyond initial expectations. These properties located in Dallas and Denver have the mix of grocery traffic, restaurants and entertainment, last mile infill locations and future densification opportunities that investors are excited about. 
On the financing side, an equally important observation is the reemergence of the traditional lender in the space. While the down the fairway grocery-anchored assets have been financeable throughout the pandemic, lenders were requiring significant holdbacks and structure around deals with perceived risk. As positive trends continue to emerge, that is having direct impact on the transaction market with more deals getting across the finish line at superior pricing and terms. 
With renewed optimism and conviction comes a vibrant transactions market, in which we will remain a disciplined player, and we expect to see deal velocity continue to accelerate, which is a great sign for the continued recovery of our industry. Now on to Glenn for the financial results for the quarter."
320371,707130318,2262443,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. The positive results we drove in the fourth quarter last year continued into the first quarter of 2021.

The positive results we drove in the fourth quarter last year continued into the first quarter of 2021. With the backdrop of an improving economy and strong leasing velocity, our solid performance was highlighted by improved rent collections and lower credit loss relative to the fourth quarter last year. 
Our balance sheet metrics also was strengthened. We continue to benefit from all the capital markets activity we undertook the past 24 months to enhance our financial structure. Now for some details on first quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $144.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the first quarter 2021 as compared to $160.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter of the prior year. The reduction was mainly driven by lower pro rata NOI of $13.6 million due to COVID related rent abatements and credit loss as well as the impact of lower occupancy on net recovery income, below-market rent recaptures and straight-line rent. These NOI reductions were offset by a $5.5 million onetime benefit from lease terminations. 
Also impacting NAREIT FFO was $5.4 million of higher G&A and interest expense due to lower capitalization from development and redevelopment projects that have been placed in service. Our operating portfolio is continuing to perform effectively. All our shopping centers are open and over 98% of our tenants are operating. With the strong leasing velocity, as Conor discussed, our lease versus economic spread has increased to 230 basis points, representing a total of $27 million of pro rata ABR, which is an excellent indicator of future cash flow growth. As expected, same-site NOI decreased 5.7% for the first quarter as it comp against a largely precoded first quarter in 2020. It also marks significant progress from the prior sequential quarter, which was down 10.5%. The improvement was mainly attributable to lower credit loss. 
We collected 94% of pro rata base rents billed during the first quarter of 2021, up from 92% for the fourth quarter last year. Our cash basis tenants represent 8.9% of ABR, and we collected 70% from these tenants during the first quarter. In addition, our deferred rent payments have been strong as we collected 84% of deferred rents billed for the first quarter, with $34.1 million of deferred rent remaining to be built. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our metrics continue to improve, and our liquidity position is in excellent shape. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 6. 7x. And on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of JV debt and preferred stock outstanding, the level was 7.4x. This represents further progress from the year-end 2020 levels of 7.1x for consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA and 7.9x on a looking basis. 
In addition, Moody's has affirmed our BAA1 unsecured debt rating with a stable outlook. From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the first quarter with over $250 million of cash and the full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, our Albertsons marketable security investment is valued at over $750 million. Our debt maturities remain minimal as we have only $125 million of consolidated mortgages returning this year, which will be repaid in the second quarter. As a result, we will be unencumbering an additional 23 properties. Our weighted average debt maturity profile stands at 10.7 years, one of the longest in the entire REIT industry. 
Based on the first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year, that includes same-site NOI turning positive in the second quarter, along with further improvement in credit loss during the second half of the year, we are raising our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.22 to $1.26 from $1.18 to $1.24 previously. As a reminder, our increased guidance range is on a stand-alone basis and does not incorporate any impact from the pending merger with Weingarten. In addition, the guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense and no monetization of our Albertsons investment. And with that, we are ready to take your questions."

But when you listen to some of the grocers, public companies that are making -- observing how their customers reacting and responding as new normal starts to take hold, they are still seeing a net-net gain to market share and shopping at home. And I think people have adapted to not only going in store, but obviously, utilization of omnichannel vehicles for accessing those groceries. So when you throw that all together, we still see the demand drivers being very strong.

I mean, there's no doubt that there is significant demand in Sunbelt, other parts of the country that have been open more so than others throughout this pandemic. But when you look at the essential based retailers throughout the country, they have been operating and doing well throughout. So we are still seeing a significant amount of demand in the Northeast, whether it be the New York suburbs, Boston, Philadelphia, et cetera. And when you think about the migration of demographics, obviously, there's a lot of headlines about the Sun Belt in Florida and the Carolinas and Texas. But you're also seeing it here in the New York metro area here where we're based, is that a lot of people that are leaving the cities here are moving to the suburbs in Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut, et cetera.

And I think you have to take into consideration all the different constituents that go into making up the shopping center, it's obviously the end shopper, the customer, the retailers and ourselves as landlord. For us as a landlord, we've always looked at ourselves as the conduit to bring all these retailers to the customer and vice versa and try to find ways in which we can service everyone collectively. So when you think of curbside, what we did in 2020, the intent there was to build a program and infrastructure that was agnostic to the retailer so that everyone can take advantage of it to                 avoid having a separate approach for each individual retailer. That we saw as being very successful. That said, every retailer has their own defined strategy in which they're trying to solve for their own unique problems. And there do become challenges when you try to consolidate them all into 1 central vision. And that's our job is to continue working with each of these retail partners to find the best way forward. And as we look to continue to innovate within our common areas and the way we work with our retailers, our goal is to try to find those uniform strategies that do work for all or at least stall for that 80%. And and then with the customer, obviously, the closest we are to the home, as you mentioned, it does provide that opportunity for them to return or to revisit and to cut down the travel time and the shipping costs. Obviously, we see that as a clear advantage for retailers that buy online, pick up in store, more and more retailers are taking advantage of that today. But this is going to be an evolving process. I think the pandemic did accelerate some of those trends, i.e., with curbside that helped pull it forward a couple of years, something that we've been talking about for a while. But it's our job to continue to stay on top of that and to innovate where we can to provide those services."

But generally speaking, I think the reopening trade is starting to accelerate as the vaccine distribution does pick up. So from an industry standpoint, we are seeing reopenings across the board."

But there is also Linda continued -- the playbook from retailers typically in downturns is again, try and take advantage of the increased vacancy, look to upgrade their fleet and look to get into the best winners possible. And so we do constant portfolio reviews with our retailers to make sure that if there is a relocation opportunity at the Kimco center is the best-in-class opportunity for them in that corridor. So to look at that as well. But I would say the lion's share is coming from net new stores, which really is exciting because it's a nice spot to be having limited supply and a lot of different demand drivers."

Today, I will focus my remarks on our leasing results, the supply and demand dynamics surrounding those results and the exciting strategic direction we are taking the organization. Ross will cover the transaction market, and Glenn will cover the quarterly numbers and our updated guidance. 
2021 is off to a refreshing and good start with robust demand for space in our last mile open-air, grocery-anchored portfolio coming from both well capitalized omnichannel tenants seeking more market share as well as some smaller businesses that have regrouped and are prepared to reinvest in their business models. The largest leasing demand categories include: Restaurants, personal care, fitness and dollar stores.
We also see healthy activity and have consummated multiple leases with grocery stores, off-price and pet supply retailers. Our leasing volume continued to build from the record-setting trend last quarter. Our new lease count was 121, totaling 586,000 square feet. This exceeds both last quarter and the prior year quarters. Of particular note, the 586,000 square feet of volume surpassed our 5-year first quarter average for new lease GLA of 506,000 square feet, and new lease spreads finished at a positive 8.2% pro rata. 
We closed the quarter with 237 renewals and options totaling 2.2 million square feet, with GLA exceeding the quarter sequentially and the prior year quarter. Renewals and option spreads finished at 6.4% pro rata. These spreads continue to reflect the recovery underway and the pricing power inherent in the quality of our portfolio. Conversely, our ability to have withstood the impacts of the pandemic reflects the defensive nature and strength of our recurring cash flows.
From a supply and demand perspective, the reality is that due to the speed of the recovery, pandemic-induced vacancies were short-lived. With limited new supply, market rents never adjusted down in any meaningful way. So when the demand snap back, we generated positive spreads. While our occupancy dipped slightly from year-end to 93.5%, it strengthened as we move through the quarter. It is our intent to continue expanding occupancy, and we are encouraged by multiple demand factors playing to the strengths of our last mile locations.
Our job is clear, focus on the blocking and tackling of leasing, work with best-in-class retailers, enhance the merchandising mix and let the numbers speak for themselves as we strengthen the resiliency of our cash flows. Our first, second and third priorities are leasing, leasing, leasing. And we continue to believe we are in the early innings of this reopening and recovery. In addition to leasing, we are prioritizing our smaller redevelopments that average double-digit returns to create an additional organic growth driver.
Long term, we believe our entitlement program will continue to create shareholder value as we unlock the highest and best use of our real estate. The pandemic has both validated and strengthened our conviction in our strategic vision to concentrate our open-air, grocery-anchored and mixed-use portfolio in the top MSAs across the country. Tenants no longer look at the last mile stores, simply a retail destination, rather, its value to retailers is now viewed holistically, providing distribution, fulfillment and retail. In valuing the location, retailers assess their ability to integrate e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar to give the customer what they demand. Convenience, value and a fulfilling experience continues to point to the last mile shopping center as mission-critical for both consumers and retailers.
Our platform is well positioned for growth, and with that growth will come further debt reductions and other benefits of scale. We are enthused about the opportunities ahead yet recognize the challenges involved. We remain committed to prioritizing ESG initiatives and supporting our tenants and local communities as we continue to navigate the pandemic and beyond.
I'd also like to touch on the exciting recent news regarding our highly strategic merger with Weingarten, a transaction that we expect to unlock considerable value in some of the highest growth markets in the country. By coming together, we will be the nation's preeminent open-air, grocery-anchored shopping center and mixed-use real estate platform. With our focus on these last mile locations and increased scale in our targeted high-growth Sun Belt markets, this transaction will significantly strengthen and enhance our portfolio quality to further gain market share and to make Kimco even more valuable to all of our tenants.
In closing, Kimco's open-air and grocery-anchored portfolio, diversed tenant mix, targeted geographic presence in the strongest growth markets in the country and improving balance sheet, provide us with a long runway for growth as we move ahead. Needless to say, the entire organization is generally energized by our efforts to build shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ross."

What a difference a quarter makes. With continued recovery from the pandemic, vaccination rollout and reduced capacity restrictions across the country, we have seen optimism building from retailers, consumers and real estate investors at the highest level since the pandemic began almost 14 months ago. Specific to the transaction, industry volume, while still off nearly 40% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, has seen a meaningful uptick from the back half of 2020.
The conviction and the stability of property rent rolls and by extension cash flows has grown beyond only the essential retailers and now includes other categories that were much less clear previously. There is no doubt the grocery-anchored shopping center is still the most in-demand category of retail and continues to command the most aggressive pricing and lowest cap rates.
Furthermore, open-air is valued at an even higher premium. Recent transactions with more specialty and lifestyle components in addition to traditional power centers have given transparency to the value and stability that our approach provides. Multiple grocery anchor deals have transacted at sub 6% cap rates in Dallas, South Florida, California, Philadelphia and Seattle, to name a few. There are also no signs of investor demand waning for that product type. We anticipate bidding to become even more aggressive as the spread of cap rate to interest rate remains wide for our asset class, particularly when compared to industrial, multifamily, self-storage and others.
More recently, aggressive bidding extending beyond the bread and butter neighborhood product is starting to emerge. Two recent deals that have a grocery store, but also a significant restaurant and entertainment component saw bidding wars with multiple rounds of offers and pricing well beyond initial expectations. These properties located in Dallas and Denver have the mix of grocery traffic, restaurants and entertainment, last-mile infill locations and future densification opportunities that investors are excited about.
On the financing side, an equally important observation is the reemergence of the traditional lender in the space. While the down-the-fairway grocery-anchored assets have been financeable throughout the pandemic, lenders were requiring significant holdbacks and structure around deals with perceived risk. As positive trends continue to emerge, that is having direct impact on the transaction market with more deals getting across the finish line at superior pricing and terms.
With renewed optimism and conviction comes a vibrant transactions market in which we will remain a disciplined player, and we expect to see deal velocity continue to accelerate, which is a great sign for the continued recovery of our industry. 
Now on to Glenn for the financial results for the quarter."
320371,707130318,2262852,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning.

The positive results we drove in the fourth quarter last year continued into the first quarter of 2021. With the backdrop of an improving economy and strong leasing velocity, our solid performance was highlighted by improved rent collections and lower credit loss relative to the fourth quarter last year. Our balance sheet metrics also was strengthened. We continue to benefit from all the capital markets activity we undertook the past 24 months to enhance our financial structure. 
Now for some details on first quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $144.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the first quarter 2021 as compared to $160.5 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter of the prior year. The reduction was mainly driven by lower pro rata NOI of $13.6 million due to COVID-related rent abatements and credit loss as well as the impact of lower occupancy on net recovery income, below-market rent recaptures and straight-line rent. These NOI reductions were offset by a $5.5 million onetime benefit from lease terminations. Also impacting NAREIT FFO was $5.4 million of higher G&A and interest expense due to lower capitalization from development and redevelopment projects that have been placed in service. 
Our operating portfolio is continuing to perform effectively. All our shopping centers are open and over 98% of our tenants are operating. With the strong leasing velocity, as Conor discussed, our lease versus economic spread has increased to 230 basis points, representing a total of $27 million of pro rata ABR, which is an excellent indicator of future cash flow growth. As expected, same-site NOI decreased 5.7% for the first quarter as it comp against a largely pre-COVID first quarter in 2020. It also marks significant progress from the prior sequential quarter, which was down 10.5%. The improvement was mainly attributable to lower credit loss.
We collected 94% of pro rata base rents billed during the first quarter of 2021, up from 92% for the fourth quarter last year. Our cash basis tenants represent 8.9% of ABR, and we collected 70% from these tenants during the first quarter. In addition, our deferred rent payments have been strong as we collected 84% of deferred rents billed for the first quarter, with $34.1 million of deferred rent remaining to be built.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our metrics continue to improve and our liquidity position is in excellent shape. At the end of the first quarter, consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.7x. And on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of JV debt and preferred stock outstanding, the level was 7.4x. This represents further progress from the year-end 2020 levels of 7.1x for consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA and 7.9x on a look-through basis. In addition, Moody's has affirmed our BAA1 unsecured debt rating with a stable outlook. 
From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the first quarter with over $250 million of cash and the full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, our Albertsons marketable security investment is valued at over $750 million. Our debt maturities remain minimal as we have only $125 million of consolidated mortgages maturing this year, which will be repaid in the second quarter. As a result, we will be unencumbering an additional 23 properties. Our weighted average debt maturity profile stands at 10.7 years, one of the longest in the entire REIT industry.
Based on the first quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year that includes same-site NOI turning positive in the second quarter, along with further improvement in credit loss during the second half of the year, we are raising our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.22 to $1.26 from $1.18 to $1.24 previously. As a reminder, our increased guidance range is on a stand-alone basis and does not incorporate any impact from the pending merger with Weingarten. In addition, the guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense and no monetization of our Albertsons investment. 
And with that, we are ready to take your questions."

So that last-mile distribution element, we don't really see changing in the future. Yes, there will be a reversion of some sort of new normal where people will start to go back to restaurants and some of those dollars spent will be diverted to that category. 
But when you listen to some of the grocers, public companies that are making -- observing how their customers reacting and responding as new normal starts to take hold, they are still seeing a net-net gain to market share and shopping at home. And I think people have adapted to not only going in store, but obviously, utilization of omnichannel vehicles for accessing those groceries. So when you throw that all together, we still see the demand drivers being very strong. And based on where we're located, in those first ring suburbs, where there's been a lot of net migration out through the pandemic, starting to take hold, we still see the demand being strong in the future."

Happy to respond to that. We are seeing robust demand across the country. I mean, there's no doubt that there's significant demand in Sun Belt, other parts of the country that have been open more so than others throughout this pandemic. But when you look at the essential-based retailers throughout the country, they have been operating and doing well throughout. So we are still seeing a significant amount of demand in the Northeast, whether it be the New York suburbs, Boston, Philadelphia, et cetera. 
And when you think about the migration demographics, obviously, there's a lot of headlines about the Sun Belt in Florida and the Carolinas and Texas. But you're also seeing it here in the New York metro area, where we're based, is that a lot of people that are leaving the cities here are moving to the suburbs in Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut, et cetera. So there is an uptick still happening in those suburbs, and we think that there is something to take advantage of there, and investors are certainly doing that.

People drive to the shopping center. They can return items rather than throwing them out. You don't have individual boxes. You don't have individual trucks driving the neighborhoods.

And I think you have to take into consideration all the different constituents that go into making up the shopping center, it's obviously the end shopper, the customer, the retailers and ourselves as landlord. For us as a landlord, we've always looked at ourselves as the conduit to bring all these retailers to the customer and vice versa and try to find ways in which we can service everyone collectively. So when you think of curbside, what we did in 2020, the intent there was to build a program and infrastructure that was agnostic to the retailer so that everyone can take advantage of it to avoid having a separate approach for each individual retailer. That we saw as being very successful. 
That said, every retailer has their own defined strategy in which they're trying to solve for their own unique problems. And there do become challenges when you try to consolidate them all into 1 central vision. And that's our job is to continue working with each of these retail partners to find the best way forward. And as we look to continue to innovate within our common areas and the way we work with our retailers, our goal is to try to find those uniformed strategies that do work for all or at least stall for that 80%. 
And  then with the customer, obviously, the closest we are to the home, as you mentioned, it does provide that opportunity for them to return or to revisit and to cut down the travel time and the shipping costs. Obviously, we see that as a clear advantage for retailers that buy online, pick up in store, more and more retailers are taking advantage of that today. But this is going to be an evolving process. I think the pandemic did accelerate some of those trends, i.e., with curbside that helped pull it forward a couple of years, something that we've been talking about for a while. But it's our job to continue to stay on top of that and to innovate where we can to provide those services."

The other piece that I was just going to mention is ESG clearly is a benefit to our entitlement program because Kimco has been so focused on this for decades. When we come into a community and showcase that we're in for the long-term and that we want to work alongside the community to make sure that the asset or the downtown that we're providing evolves alongside the community, we can showcase our ESG initiatives and all the accomplishments that we've been making to give ourselves the opportunity to partner with those folks.

There's also been -- with those operators in fitness, there's a number of operators that haven't reopened or won't plan to reopen.

We do -- in terms of the scope and the demand and the requirements of the tenants, that really hasn't changed. So it's more about material pricing. That could have an impact on cost on a go-forward basis in the interim. Obviously, with -- there are -- we're still working through some supply constraints in distribution as a result of the pandemic. So you have seen some increase in pricing for material costs, whether it be lumber, HVAC, et cetera. That could be short term in nature as the distribution channel start to release some of those bottlenecks that have occurred through the pandemic. And so we just have to monitor those closely. That could have some moderate impact in the near term, but we anticipate, again, that's short period of time and then hopefully would subside again. 
But in terms of deal costs in general, we haven't seen much change in terms of the demand of the requirements from the retailer side. So if you net out any potential increase in the short term, you'd assume it to carry on as is. It's also dependent on the type of deals you do per quarter. It's -- if you're doing split box value creation opportunities, we had a couple of those this quarter that had elevated costs, while others are just a simple backfill. Or if you're going non-grocery to grocery, obviously, our big focus is on grocery right now. So you could seal some deal costs that are a little bit higher, but it's because of that grocery conversion. But subsequently, on top of that, you're either seeing -- you're obviously seeing increase in rent in some of those cases. But in addition, you're getting longer term.

What we're seeing, especially on the anchor side, is that there's a short window of opportunity for those retailers to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, and so they want to take advantage of that and step in.

But there is also, Linda, continued -- the playbook from retailers typically in downturns is, again, try and take advantage of the increased vacancy, look to upgrade their fleet and look to get into the best centers possible. And so we do, do constant portfolio reviews with our retailers to make sure that if there is a relocation opportunity at the Kimco Center is the best-in-class opportunity for them in that corridor, so to look at that as well. But I would say the lion's share is coming from net new stores, which really is exciting because it's a nice spot to be having limited supply and a lot of different demand drivers."

Today, I'll focus my remarks on our operating results. The supply and demand dynamics surrounding those results, the strategic direction we are taking the organization and the powerful position Kimco will have upon the closing of our merger with Weingarten. Ross will then provide some perspective on the transaction market, and Glenn will provide additional financial insight on the quarter along with our updated guidance. 
As I have often mentioned, our core focus has been and will continue to be on leasing, leasing, leasing. It fuels our growth, validates the quality of our portfolio, strengthens our balance sheet, reduces risk and is a catalyst to overcome pandemic-induced disruption. Our second quarter leasing activity and overall results continue to build upon the success that began earlier this year as we leased 1.8 million square feet and signed 333 leases. 
This leasing included 139 new leases with GLA exceeding the prior sequential quarter. Overall occupancy finished at 93.9%, up 40 basis points while our new leasing spreads of 9.2% and renewal spreads of 4.7% resulted in a record 42 quarters or 10 years in a row of positive spreads. 
The combination of record leasing demand in a 5-year low of new vacancies continue to drive the earlier-than-anticipated occupancy recovery for Kimco. Traffic at our properties is back to 2019 levels and the healthy leasing market reflects the reopening of the economy and the rush by tenants to capture market share is apparent as they pursue our high-quality locations. 
Moreover, in our attractive and strategically selected markets we do not anticipate any material new supply in the near term to impact our pricing power. Robust demand for anchor space continues across our portfolio. Centers of the grocery component have outperformed during the pandemic and continue to lead the rebound. 
We're also seeing data on restaurants that show people are eager to go out and meet again with the Sun Belt states outperforming. Similar trends with fitness where traffic is coming back quickly. On the store openings, off-price continues to be a leading source of demand but we're also seeing solid demand from furniture, home goods, pet supply, hobby, health and wellness, including discount fitness, just to name a few. 
Our anchor occupancy finished the quarter at 96.9%, up 70 basis points which is the single largest quarterly gain since we started reporting anchor occupancy 10 years ago. Small shop demand also continues to recover, albeit at a slower pace. The small shop demand that's now building is coming from franchise quick service restaurants, beauty, hair and nail salons, medical and other services. 
While small shop occupancy did finish down 30 basis points to end at 85.5%, it was impacted from the inclusion of Dania Phases 2 and 3 into occupancy. If not for this, small shop occupancy would have actually increased sequentially by 30 basis points during the second quarter, and we remain confident that the smaller tenants will gradually accelerate their demand for space as they gain comfort that the recovery from last year's severe disruption is sustainable. 
Further, the importance of being located as a last mile solution for a multitude of potential tenants continues to grow. Our mission-critical last mile brick-and-mortar locations will prove to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end consumer. 
One silver lining of the last 1.5 years is that it showcased the strength of our repositioned grocery-anchored portfolio, the resiliency of our cash flows and the strength and diversity of our strong mix of high credit tenants. As our occupancy recovers, we anticipate EBITDA and FFO growth will follow and bolster our balance sheet metrics. 
We are also in a unique position to drive earnings results with multiple levers for growth, led by our continued emphasis on leasing and attractive redevelopment opportunities. On the strategic front, the completion of our accretive merger with Weingarten is fast approaching and ahead of schedule. The shareholder votes are scheduled for August 3 and subject to customary closing conditions, the closing should occur shortly thereafter. 
With Weingarten's portfolio, combined with Kimco, -- Following the merger, we will have even more confident in our ability to drive significant and sustained value from this concentrated platform of open air, grocery-anchored and mixed-use assets in the leading MSAs across the country. 
Touching further on the power of the merger, the combined company will continue to focus on operating a dynamic and well-diversified portfolio in these markets, but with greater scale, resources and embedded opportunities. We expect that the complementary business operations will allow us to extract annualized cost efficiencies while deleveraging our balance sheet. 
I think it is important to reiterate the scale and reach we will have with our targeted first ring suburbs of core markets across the Sun Belt. Together, we'll have approximately 550 open-air grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets, comprising more than 100 million square feet of gross leasable area. 
At closing, approximately 82% of the company's total annual base rent will be derived from strategic Sun Belt growth markets and high barrier-to-entry top coastal markets. The combined platform will also have a highly diversified, strong credit tenant base with the top 10 tenants all essential, industry-leading grocers and best-in-class retailers with no single tenant representing more than 4% of ABR. 
And given that we are not completely out of the pandemic wood yet with the reality and threat of new strains,  we believe the combined portfolio, strong balance sheet and battle-tested team puts us in an even better position to withstand any disruptions to the ongoing recovery. 
Looking beyond the closing, the Weingarten portfolio brings a largely funded and derisked development pipeline and presents vast potential in the form of embedded untapped redevelopment from which we believe we can extract incremental value. Ultimately, we believe this accretive combination will result in enhanced financial strength with the flexibility and resources to efficiently capitalize on the value creation opportunities ahead. 
While we will be quantifying the impact until after the transaction is closed, we are highly energized by the opportunities in front of us to maximize value for shareholders. In closing, our team is motivated and executing. As we look forward, our ability to create value will be enhanced in the coming years by our last mile fulfillment opportunities with high-growth, high-quality open air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use properties that will enable us to realize substantial operating benefits. With that, I will turn the call over to Ross."

As the recovery from the pandemic continues to take shape, and the essential nature of our open-air shopping center locations become more apparent, the capital flowing to the space also continues to significantly increa",456,"Good morning, and thank you, Conor. As the recovery from the pandemic continues to take shape, and the essential nature of our open-air shopping center locations become more apparent, the capital flowing to the space also continues to significantly increase. A well-capitalized private equity investor recently told me  there's only so much sub-4% cap rate industrial and multifamily products we can buy. The risk-adjusted return for high-quality open-air retail products has become increasingly evident. 
We have seen this sentiment play out in the transactions market this quarter and the momentum continues to build. We have seen it on portfolios and one-off centers alike. Leasing velocity and renewal rates have given investors confidence in both the stability and future upside of existing cash flows and rent rolls. 
With capital abundant on both the equity and debt side and with interest rates declining even lower recently, a very accommodative environment for deal flow exists. This includes a recently closed grocery portfolio in the Philadelphia MSA, a diversified portfolio of retail assets in Phoenix, one-off grocery deals in South Florida, New Jersey and several in Southern California and Atlanta to give a few examples. 
As we see brokers starting to report results, it is clear 2021 is on track to be one of the highest production years for the industry. There is no question that appetite for open-air retail is voracious. We continue to be opportunistic, yet selective and disciplined in the investments we make. 
In the second quarter, as an addition to our structured investments program, we invested approximately $55 million in a preferred equity position into the rent, a dominant retail, entertainment and mixed-use district having over 1 million square feet of GLA located in the fast-growing San Antonio market. The property has consistently been the #1 most heavily traffic center in all of Texas with exceptional tenant sales to support the property. 
We are extremely excited for the upside of this investment, which was made at an attractive current yield and reasonable basis along with the right-of-first refusal to buy the center in the future. Another recent success is the sale of 2 rite aid California-based distribution centers closed in the second quarter that were acquired by our taxable REIT subsidiary earlier this year in a sale-leaseback transaction. 
When we completed the sale of these 2 properties at a price of $108 million, it represented a significant increase from the $84 million paid just 5 months earlier and generated a 72% IRR for Kimco on this investment. As we carefully consider capital allocation and disciplined investment opportunities, we believe that selective acquisitions, structured investments and partnership buyouts will continue to present themselves at the appropriate times. Now to Glenn for the financial results for the quarter."
320371,717669640,2354077,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our solid second quarter growth was fueled by continued improvement in rent collections, lower credit loss and very strong same-site NOI. Our strong leasing efforts, combined with an improving economy, produced a sequential",810,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our solid second quarter growth was fueled by continued improvement in rent collections, lower credit loss and very strong same-site NOI. Our strong leasing efforts, combined with an improving economy, produced a sequential uptick in occupancy and another quarter of positive leasing spreads. In addition, as EBITDA has increased, our debt metrics have also improved. There are for some details on second quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $148.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter 2021, which includes merger-related charges of $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share in connection with the anticipated merger with Weingarten. 
This compares to $103.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of the prior year. The significant growth was mainly driven by increased pro-rata NOI of $44.7 million, comprised of lower credit loss from potentially uncollectible accounts and straight-line rents of $50.9 million and higher lease termination income of $2.7 million. These increases were offset by lower minimum rents and reduced CAM and real estate tax recoveries due to lower occupancy compared to the same quarter last year. 
The improvement in credit loss is attributable to our increased cash collections as we are approaching pre-pandemic rent collection levels. During the second quarter, we collected over 96% of pro-rata base rent bill. We also collected over 77% of rents due from cash basis tenants during the second quarter, up from 70% collected in the first quarter. 
Further, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $7 million during the second quarter of 2021 versus $1.8 million collected during the same period in 2020. Our cash basis tenants comprise 8.8% of total annualized base rents. In addition, we collected almost 90% of the deferred rents billed during the second quarter. At the end of June, we have approximately $25.4 million of deferred rents, which remain to be billed over the next 12 months and 64% of this amount is reserved. As Conor mentioned, the operating portfolio delivered significant improvement in the second quarter with a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. 
Our same-site NOI growth, including redevelopments, was 16.7%, including a 30 basis point uplift from redevelopments. This is the first positive quarter of same-site NOI growth since first quarter 2020 and should be the start of a recurring trend. Another positive indicator is the increase in the spread of leased versus economic occupancy, which now stands at approximately 300 basis points, up from 230 basis points last quarter and represents $33.4 million of pro-rata ABR. This spread bodes well for future cash flow growth. 
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.3x. On a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of JV debt and pro rata and preferred stock outstanding, the metric was 7.1x. These metrics are better than the pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2019. 
From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the second quarter with over $230 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. We will be using cash on hand and a portion of the revolver to fund the cash component of the Weingarten merger consideration and transaction costs. In addition, our Albertsons marketable security investment was valued at close to $800 million at the end of June, and there are no plans to monetize any portion of this investment during 2021. 
During the second quarter, we repaid $120 million of mortgage debt, unencumbering an additional 23 assets. We have no consolidated debt maturing for the balance of the year and our next bond maturity is not until November of 2022. Our weighted average consolidated debt maturity profile stands at 10.7 years, one of the longest in the REIT industry. As for JV debt, we have only $53 million maturing for the remainder of the year with refinancing alternatives already identified. 
With respect to outlook for the balance of the year, based on our first half 2021 operating results and expectations that include ongoing improvement in credit loss and same-site NOI growth, we are again raising our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.29 to $1.33 from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26. This new range is presented on a stand-alone basis and does not incorporate any impact of the pending merger with Weingarten other than the $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share of merger-related charges incurred during the second quarter of 2021. Assuming the merger is completed during the third quarter as anticipated, we will provide updated guidance on a combined basis on our next earnings call. 
Lastly, with respect to our common dividend, shortly after the merger is completed, the Board of Directors expect to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend, which will be payable during the third quarter. And now we'll be ready to take your questions."

So we're starting to see a lot of both private and some of our public peers getting much more aggressive on that product type, and we think that will just continue. 
We are seeing more activity on power and lifestyle. There's not as much that we've seen transact as of yet. But with the improvement in the economy, with the improvement in the retailer sales, we are seeing much more conviction on some of those categories that you see in lifestyle centers such as restaurants, entertainment, fitness, really coming back and solidifying themselves. So I think that there's just a lot of demand for all product types right now within open-air retail."

So I think you have to start there and understand where the retailers are today and then what we anticipate going forward. I think for a few reasons, we will continue to see this demand stay pace or maintain pace from what we've seen in the last 2 quarters. 
One, you still are -- the retailers are still working through their open to buy numbers that they're trying to achieve in '20 and now in '21. So there's a bit of a bottleneck there that they're actively trying to expand and upgrade the quality of their portfolio to A-quality sites with the new supply that's obviously come online, not the new supply, but the vacancy as a result of the pandemic. 
That's giving them the opportunity. Second to that, other retailers were able to raise additional capital or rightsize our balance sheet through the pandemic. So when you look at grocers, such as fresh market that may have not been necessarily on an expansion mode. pre pandemic, they're now starting to look at new stores and new locations to add grocery in new markets. 
So you now have some new demand drivers on top of the pent-up demand from the existing retailers. And then third, you have others that are really testing new formats. We've learned so much in the last 6 months of how consumers respond to retailers how they want to shop. And so you do have retailers like container store that had been fairly set in their way about their historic format. But now looking at smaller formats and penetrating other markets as well. So you'll continue to see that as a demand factor.  And then new concepts, new concepts like Choice markets, which is trying to reinvent the C-store and adapt to more millennial trends. DoorDash has come out with DashMart. And so you're starting to add some new categories on top of what we've historically seen. So I think as long as you maintain those demand drivers, we'll be able to make good progress in recovering our occupancy and get back to what was our peak."

While others are looking to potentially expand the box to incorporate more last mile distribution as Conor mentioned earlier, or some other form of fulfillment. The first ring suburb, that's really where we're focused. And obviously, there's been a huge value add and being closest to the customer and where they live. And now with what the world will look like with the hybrid back-to-work model, there's definitely much more of a balance between urban and first-ring suburban markets. And so we'll continue to see that, that demand pick up on the first ring suburbs.

If you're well capitalized, you have vision, you're willing to test experiment and be a true partner and good steward of not only the retailer but of the community itself. It makes a big, big difference.  For a lot of these small shops is as their livelihood, and they're investing a tremendous amount of spot equity in their own mining into the business. And so they want to make sure that whoever they're aligned with is also in partnership with them. I think that's been a big high opening experience for a lot of those retailers. So that's definitely helped us with retention levels."

So you're right. There's always a thought of what's to come with the pandemic. And as you probably know, cash basis is the kind of category where tenants can pop in and out of it from a GAAP perspective. So there's criteria that you need to set. 
So generally, we look to see that the tenant remains current on their base rent for 6 to 9 months. And so we'll continue to monitor that trend. I do anticipate that in the second half of the year, there will be some of our tenants that make up that 8.8% of ABR that Glenn mentioned, will be coming out of cash basis. But just something to keep in mind when thinking about that and just because the tenant comes at a cash basis, obviously, as I said, they need to be current on their rent. So the impact that you're going to see on credit loss is very minimal, right, because they're actually paying where you may see some sort of FFO impact is really on the straight line side, which although I wish that was cash, it's not, but there could be an FFO impact from that."

And so we continue to think that's a great use of our sweat equity to create opportunity for future value creation on the asset and then activate that at our -- when it's the best time to do so. On the smaller redevelopment side, clearly, those are ones we get the best bang for our buck, where we're, on average, returning over 10% on invested capital. 
So we continue to monitor and mine the portfolio for those. Typically, it's adding a pad out in front with a drive-through or expanding a shopping center in some way, shape or form. And those continue to be right around, I would say, between $80 million to $100 million a year of capital investment. Now we'd love to do more of that. Clearly, it's some great returns on capital and we'll continue to try and look for those opportunities going forward. 
And then on the larger scale redevelopment projects, we continue to look through our portfolio and say, what's the best way to activate these on these projects, and we want to be mindful of the fact that we have a lot of opportunity, but there's different ways to structure those opportunities. And so you've seen us do it in the past, where we've sold entitlements, typically office entitlements. We've ground these entitlements. Those sometimes are multifamily projects or were joint venture and done projects that add a nice live-work-play experience to the shopping center. So we'll continue to do that. As you know, we've done a lot of work on entitlements already. We're up to 5,000 apartment units in title and continue to think that's a great use of our time and effort going forward."

So as evidenced by the amount of transactions that occurred, there are plenty of owners that are willing and have been executing on dispositions. They see that the market continues to work in their favor. The financeability of these assets has never been greater with interest rates where they are. So it is a very good time if you're a seller, to take advantage of all-time low interest rates and thus, cap rates. 
At the same time, there is an opportunity for owners that have the capital and the financial wherewithal to reinvest in assets to try to stabilize cash flows if they were be down a little bit during the COVID, depending on what type of tenancy they had. So you're seeing certain decisions potentially being delayed for a period of time. And you always have to compete with the opportunity for an owner to refinance their assets because, as I mentioned, the financeability of those assets is very much available. So every circumstance is unique, but we're finding plenty of opportunities. We do think that we'll continue to see structured investments with the preferred equity and the mezz financing present themselves. We'll continue to be very disciplined and only look to invest in those assets where we feel very good about the basis, our current return. And then, of course, it has to check the box as to an asset that we would potentially look to own in the future, and that's where we secure a right-of-first refusal or right-of-first offer. So we've intentionally not put out any sort of mandate on the amount that we're going to invest in that program. But to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, we're ready and excited to do that."

But I would say from a more macro level, the difference between preferred and mezzanine. In the preferred investments, we typically look for a high single-digit current return on our investment, but we do participate in the back-end profit assuming that the asset performs the way that we've underwritten, there's usually back-end participation that can juice that return somewhere into the teens from an IRR perspective. 
On the mezzanine financing, oftentimes, those are higher coupons, but don't necessarily have the back-end participation. So we're getting double digits current or sometimes even into the teens. But it very much depends on each asset. As it relates to the RIM, that 1 is a preferred equity investment. So like I said, we got very high single digits current. But when we look at the opportunity on that asset and some of the things that we think can occur in terms of occupancy increases and maybe some repositioning and just the general strength of that asset in the market, we think that we will certainly see some participation on the profit on the back end. So typically looking for, at a minimum, teens IRRs."

And maybe you mentioned something else about JVs, obviously, you know your JV assets better than others. As you look forward, is there an opportunity to buy out JV stakes in your portfolio and for that matter, in the Weingarten portfolio, which has, I think, something like 39 -- or 31 or somewhere in that neighborhood of JV assets?

And I'm going to kind of keep it at a high level rather than commenting directly on the Weingarten specific questions. But there's no doubt that we think that there's still a disconnect between public and private pricing.  When we look at NAVs of ourselves and some other peers versus, like you said, some of the transactions that are happening in the low 5s, and we're also starting to see them dipping into the high 4s.  There is still very much a spread between those 2. But the Bentall GreenOak portfolio, very high-quality, grocery-anchored product and it was not surprising to see a very strong demand and many bidders and multiple rounds of bidding before that deal was ultimately awarded. And I think we're going to continue to see more of that. 
In terms of partnership buyouts, I mean that is something that we have taken advantage of in the past. Oftentimes, it's difficult to model or forecast or predict when those opportunities present themselves. All of our partners have different investment horizons and reasons for why they may look to exit, but we do stay ready. We stay in very close communication with our partners, and we have a pretty good sense as to when they may look to exit or what might trigger that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do think that there's going to be some of that in the relatively near future. 
And as it relates to our ability to have sort of a right-of-first offer, right-of-first refusal,  there's no doubt that for these assets that we're managing and that we're operating day in and day out. We are the logical buyer. We can move quicker than any other third party can given the fact that we know the assets inside and out. So typically, it's a win-win. If it's an asset that we view as a long-term hold and for 1 reason or another, our partner is looking to exit. It's a great chance for us to buy out the remainder and for our partners to have a very smooth and quick execution. So again, we'll see more of that as time goes on over the next year or so."

We have -- since we've been virtual for most of this pandemic, we've been able to do more virtual portfolio reviews and talk with more tenants on the regular on expansion plans and looking for space throughout the portfolio. One thing -- you're right about the cadence there, but 1 thing we found is that many of our retailers that are well capitalized, have actually come to us and say, ""Hey, we actually need a few more deals for this year or we need -- so there's actually a bit of that going on as well. So it's broad-based, which I like to see. Clearly, grocery continues to expand and is white. But then you've got the other categories that we like to see that complement the cross-shopping, which typically is led by off-price and then you've got the home improvement, home bid section continues to be very, very strong. And it goes on from there. The interesting part, I think, is the pent-up demand for probably the most impacted categories that we're seeing. So the entertainment, the fitness and the restaurant side of it have really come back strong, faster than we anticipated. And we think that, that bodes well for the recovery of those sectors. And obviously, we're not out of the woods yet, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we want to be careful about how we talk about the future because we still got the Delta variant that's causing a lot of issues, but we have a playbook now. We have the Kimco branded curbside pickup program that's on the entire portfolio. And we have a battle-tested team that I think can really manage through this.

Today, I'll focus my remarks on our operating results. The supply and demand dynamics surrounding those results, the strategic direction we are taking the organization and the powerful position Kimco will have upon",1087,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll focus my remarks on our operating results. The supply and demand dynamics surrounding those results, the strategic direction we are taking the organization and the powerful position Kimco will have upon the closing of our merger with Weingarten. Ross will then provide some perspective on the transaction market, and Glenn will provide additional financial insight on the quarter along with our updated guidance.  
As I have often mentioned, our core focus has been and will continue to be on leasing, leasing, leasing. It fuels our growth, validates the quality of our portfolio, strengthens our balance sheet, reduces risk and is a catalyst to overcome pandemic-induced disruption. Our second quarter leasing activity and overall results continue to build upon the success that began earlier this year as we leased 1.8 million square feet and signed 333 leases. This leasing included 139 new leases of GLA exceeding the prior sequential quarter. Overall occupancy finished at 93.9%, up 40 basis points while our new leasing spreads of 9.2% and renewal spreads of 4.7% resulted in a record 42 quarters or 10 years in a row of positive spreads.  
The combination of record leasing demand in a 5-year low of new vacancies continue to drive the earlier-than-anticipated occupancy recovery for Kimco. Traffic at our properties is back to 2019 levels and the healthy leasing market reflects the reopening of the economy and the rush by tenants to capture market share is apparent as they pursue our high-quality locations.  
Moreover, in our attractive and strategically selected markets, we do not anticipate any material new supply in the near term to impact our pricing power. Robust demand for anchor space continues across our portfolio. Centers of the grocery component have outperformed during the pandemic and continue to lead the rebound.  
We're also seeing data on restaurants that show people are eager to go out and eat again with the Sun Belt states outperformance. Similar trends with fitness where traffic is coming back quickly. On the store openings, off-price continues to be a leading source of demand but we're also seeing solid demand from furniture, home goods, pet supply, hobby, health and wellness, including discount fitness, just to name a few.  
Our anchor occupancy finished the quarter at 96.9%, up 70 basis points which is the single largest quarterly gain since we started reporting anchor occupancy 10 years ago. 
Small shop demand also continues to recover, albeit at a slower pace. The small shop demand that's now building is coming from franchise quick service restaurants, beauty, hair and nail salons, medical and other services. While small shop occupancy did finish down 30 basis points to end at 85.5%, it was impacted from the inclusion of Dania Phases II and III into occupancy. If not for this, small shop occupancy would have actually increased sequentially by 30 basis points during the second quarter, and we remain confident that the smaller tenants will gradually accelerate their demand for space as they gain comfort that the recovery from last year's severe disruption is sustainable.  
Further, the importance of being located as a last mile solution for a multitude of potential tenants continues to grow. 
Our mission-critical last mile brick-and-mortar locations will prove to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end consumer. One silver lining of the last 1.5 years is that it showcased the strength of our repositioned grocery-anchored portfolio, the resiliency of our cash flows and the strength and diversity of our strong mix of high credit tenants. 
As our occupancy recovers, we anticipate EBITDA and FFO growth will follow and bolster our balance sheet metrics. We are also in a unique position to drive earnings results with multiple levers for growth, led by our continued emphasis on leasing and attractive redevelopment opportunities. 
On the strategic front, the completion of our accretive merger with Weingarten is fast approaching and ahead of schedule. The shareholder votes are scheduled for August 3 and subject to customary closing conditions, the closing should occur shortly thereafter.  
With Weingarten's portfolio, combined with Kimco's, following the merger, we will have even more confident in our ability to drive significant and sustained value from this concentrated platform of open air, grocery-anchored and mixed-use assets in the leading MSAs across the country.  
Touching further on the power of the merger, the combined company will continue to focus on operating a dynamic and well-diversified portfolio in these markets, but with greater scale, resources and embedded opportunities. We expect that the complementary business operations will allow us to extract annualized cost efficiencies while deleveraging our balance sheet.  
I think it is important to reiterate the scale and reach we will have with our targeted first ring suburbs of core markets across the Sun Belt. Together, we'll have approximately 550 open-air grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets, comprising more than 100 million square feet of gross leasable area. 
At closing, approximately 82% of the company's total annual base rent will be derived from strategic Sun Belt growth markets and high barrier-to-entry top coastal markets. 
The combined platform will also have a highly diversified, strong credit tenant base with the top 10 tenants all essential, industry-leading grocers and best-in-class retailers with no single tenant representing more than 4% of ABR.  
And given that we are not completely out of the pandemic woods yet, with the reality and threat of new strains,  we believe the combined portfolio, strong balance sheet and battle-tested team puts us in an even better position to withstand any disruptions to the ongoing recovery.  
Looking beyond the closing, the Weingarten portfolio brings a largely funded and derisked development pipeline and presents vast potential in the form of embedded untapped redevelopment from which we believe we can extract incremental value. Ultimately, we believe this accretive combination will result in enhanced financial strength with the flexibility and resources to efficiently capitalize on the value creation opportunities ahead.  
While we will be quantifying the impact until after the transaction is closed, we are highly energized by the opportunities in front of us to maximize value for shareholders. 
In closing, our team is motivated and executing. As we look forward, our ability to create value will be enhanced in the coming years by our last mile fulfillment opportunities with high-growth, high-quality open air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use properties that will enable us to realize substantial operating benefits. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Ross."

As the recovery from the pandemic continues to take shape, and the essential nature of our open-air shopping center locations become more apparent, the capital flowing to the space also continues to significantly increa",456,"Good morning, and thank you, Conor. As the recovery from the pandemic continues to take shape, and the essential nature of our open-air shopping center locations become more apparent, the capital flowing to the space also continues to significantly increase. A well-capitalized private equity investor recently told me there's only so much sub-4% cap rate industrial and multifamily products we can buy, the risk-adjusted return for high-quality open-air retail products has become increasingly evident.  
We have seen this sentiment play out in the transactions market this quarter and the momentum continues to build. We have seen it on portfolios and one-off centers alike. Leasing velocity and renewal rates have given investors confidence in both the stability and future upside of existing cash flows and rent rolls.  
With capital abundant on both the equity and debt side and with interest rates declining even lower recently, a very accommodative environment for deal flow exists. This includes a recently closed grocery portfolio in the Philadelphia MSA, a diversified portfolio of retail assets in Phoenix, one-off grocery deals in South Florida, New Jersey and several in Southern California and Atlanta to give a few examples.  
As we see brokers starting to report results, it is clear 2021 is on track to be one of the highest production years for the industry. There is no question that appetite for open-air retail is voracious. We continue to be opportunistic, yet selective and disciplined in the investments we make.  
In the second quarter, as an addition to our structured investments program, we invested approximately $55 million in a preferred equity position into The Rim, a dominant retail, entertainment and mixed-use district having over 1 million square feet of GLA located in the fast-growing San Antonio market. The property has consistently been the #1 most heavily traffic center in all of Texas with exceptional tenant sales to support the property.  
We are extremely excited for the upside of this investment, which was made at an attractive current yield and reasonable basis along with the right-of-first refusal to buy the center in the future. 
Another recent success is the sale of 2 Rite Aid California-based distribution centers closed in the second quarter that were acquired by our taxable REIT subsidiary earlier this year in a sale-leaseback transaction.  
When we completed the sale of these 2 properties at a price of $108 million, it represented a significant increase from the $84 million paid just 5 months earlier and generated a 72% IRR for Kimco on this investment. As we carefully consider capital allocation and disciplined investment opportunities, we believe that selective acquisitions, structured investments and partnership buyouts will continue to present themselves at the appropriate times. 
Now to Glenn for the financial results for the quarter."
320371,717669640,2354525,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our solid second quarter growth was fueled by continued improvement in rent collections, lower credit loss and very strong same-site NOI. Our strong leasing efforts, combined with an improving economy, produced a sequential",809,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our solid second quarter growth was fueled by continued improvement in rent collections, lower credit loss and very strong same-site NOI. Our strong leasing efforts, combined with an improving economy, produced a sequential uptick in occupancy and another quarter of positive leasing spreads. In addition, as EBITDA has increased, our debt metrics have also improved. 
Now for some details on second quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $148.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter 2021, which includes merger-related charges of $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share in connection with the anticipated merger with Weingarten. This compares to $103.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the second quarter of the prior year. 
The significant growth was mainly driven by increased pro-rata NOI of $44.7 million, comprised of lower credit loss from potentially uncollectible accounts and straight-line rents of $50.9 million and higher lease termination income of $2.7 million. These increases were offset by lower minimum rents and reduced CAM and real estate tax recoveries due to lower occupancy compared to the same quarter last year.  
The improvement in credit loss is attributable to our increased cash collections as we are approaching pre-pandemic rent collection levels. During the second quarter, we collected over 96% of pro-rata base rent bill. We also collected over 77% of rents due from cash basis tenants during the second quarter, up from 70% collected in the first quarter.  
Further, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $7 million during the second quarter of 2021 versus $1.8 million collected during the same period in 2020. Our cash basis tenants comprise 8.8% of total annualized base rents. In addition, we collected almost 90% of the deferred rents billed during the second quarter. At the end of June, we have approximately $25.4 million of deferred rents, which remain to be billed over the next 12 months and 64% of this amount is reserved. 
As Conor mentioned, the operating portfolio delivered significant improvement in the second quarter with a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads.  
Our same-site NOI growth, including redevelopments, was 16.7%, including a 30 basis point uplift from redevelopments. This is the first positive quarter of same-site NOI growth since first quarter 2020 and should be the start of a recurring trend. Another positive indicator is the increase in the spread of leased versus economic occupancy, which now stands at approximately 300 basis points, up from 230 basis points last quarter and represents $33.4 million of pro-rata ABR. This spread bodes well for future cash flow growth.  
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.3x. On a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of JV debt and pro rata and preferred stock outstanding, the metric was 7.1x. These metrics are better than the pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2019.  
From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the second quarter with over $230 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. We will be using cash on hand and a portion of the revolver to fund the cash component of the Weingarten merger consideration and transaction costs. 
In addition, our Albertsons marketable security investment was valued at close to $800 million at the end of June, and there are no plans to monetize any portion of this investment during 2021.  
During the second quarter, we repaid $120 million of mortgage debt, unencumbering an additional 23 assets. We have no consolidated debt maturing for the balance of the year and our next bond maturity is not until November of 2022. Our weighted average consolidated debt maturity profile stands at 10.7 years, one of the longest in the REIT industry. As for JV debt, we have only $53 million maturing for the remainder of the year with refinancing alternatives already identified.  
With respect to outlook for the balance of the year, based on our first half 2021 operating results and expectations that include ongoing improvement in credit loss and same-site NOI growth, we are again raising our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.29 to $1.33 from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26. This new range is presented on a stand-alone basis and does not incorporate any impact of the pending merger with Weingarten other than the $3.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share of merger-related charges incurred during the second quarter of 2021. Assuming the merger is completed during the third quarter as anticipated, we will provide updated guidance on a combined basis on our next earnings call.  
Lastly, with respect to our common dividend, shortly after the merger is completed, the Board of Directors expect to declare a regular quarterly cash dividend, which will be payable during the third quarter. 
And now we'll be ready to take your questions."

So I think you have to start there and understand where the retailers are today and then what we anticipate going forward. I think for a few reasons, we will continue to see this demand stay pace -- or maintain pace from what we've seen in the last 2 quarters. 
One, you still are -- the retailers are still working through. They are open to buy numbers that they're trying to achieve in '20 and now in '21. So there's a bit of a bottleneck there that they're actively trying to expand and upgrade the quality of their portfolio to A-quality sites with the new supply that's obviously come online, not the new supply, but the vacancy as a result of the pandemic. 
That's giving them the opportunity. Second to that, other retailers were able to raise additional capital or rightsize our balance sheet through the pandemic. So when you look at grocers, such as fresh market that may have not been necessarily on an expansion mode. Pre pandemic, they're now starting to look at new stores and new locations to add grocery in new markets. 
So you now have some new demand drivers on top of the pent-up demand from the existing retailers. And then third, you have others that are really testing new formats. We've learned so much in the last 6 months of how consumers respond to retailers, how they want to shop. And so you do have retailers like container store that had been fairly set in their way about their historic format. 
But now looking at smaller formats and penetrating other markets as well. So you'll continue to see that as a demand factor. And then new concepts, new concepts like Choice markets, which is trying to reinvent the C-store and adapt to more millennial trends. DoorDash has come out with DashMart. And so you're starting to add some new categories on top of what we've historically seen. 
So I think as long as you maintain those demand drivers, we'll be able to make good progress in recovering our occupancy and get back to what was our peak."

And I think when you combine that with our team, it leads us to believe that the occupancy is going to continue to trend in the right direction. 
Now we might see a pause next quarter because of some of the eviction moratoriums that are burning off. But we think there's enough demand, obviously, there to backfill that. And it's led by the anchors, and then we think that's going to follow with the small shops. The anchored demand is diverse, which is great to see.

So they're looking at new box opportunities that are more prototypical to what historically they had targeted.  
While others are looking to potentially expand the box to incorporate more last mile distribution as Conor mentioned earlier, or some other form of fulfillment, the first ring suburb, that's really where we're focused. And obviously, there's been a huge value add and being closest to the customer and where they live. 
And now with what the world will look like with the hybrid back-to-work model, there's definitely much more of a balance between urban and first-ring suburban markets. And so we'll continue to see that, that demand pick up on the first ring suburbs. So it's a really hard answer to give that specific in 1 general -- in one specific way because every retailer is looking at it a little bit differently based on historically what they've done and where they see these voids and how they want to achieve them."

We felt very good about the leases that we were able to negotiate with them in terms of the rent versus market, having annual increases that we felt were very attractive and obviously, seeing the demand for single-tenant products, particularly in the industrial space, we knew that there was a lot of value that was created on that acquisition. So we wanted to maintain as much flexibility as possible, which was why we bought it into the TRS and the market spoke.

So we are fielding a lot of questions, a lot of comments, a lot of inquiries from institutional capital that want to invest in retail, want to take advantage, see that there is clearly a need and the utility of our open-air space, but how do they actually go about investing in that. So we're having a lot of those conversations. There's plenty of capital that's looking for it and now it's just being very selective as to where we put our capital and who we invest alongside. 
That being said, there are other investors that have substantial legacy retail investments, many of which are not necessarily in open-air retail that are looking to maybe reduce that exposure and that also becomes an opportunity for us.

For us, as Conor mentioned earlier, with curbside, we've done an extraordinary amount in working with our tenants and trying to provide a true Kimco advantage to be a retail partner within a Kimco Center. 
And I think what retailers have come to learn is that your landlord matters. If you're well capitalized, you have vision, you're willing to test experiment and be a true partner and good steward of not only the retailer but of the community itself. It makes a big, big difference.  For a lot of these small shops this is their livelihood, and they're investing a tremendous amount of spot equity in their own mining into the business. And so they want to make sure that whoever they're aligned with is also in partnership with them. I think that's been a big high opening experience for a lot of those retailers.

So you're right. There's always a thought of what's to come with the pandemic. And as you probably know, cash basis is the kind of category where tenants can pop in and out of it from a GAAP perspective. So there's criteria that you need to set. 
So generally, we look to see that the tenant remains current on their base rent for 6 to 9 months. And so we'll continue to monitor that trend. I do anticipate that in the second half of the year, there will be some of our tenants that make up that 8.8% of ABR that Glenn mentioned, will be coming out of cash basis. 
But just something to keep in mind when thinking about that and just because the tenant comes at a cash basis, obviously, as I said, they need to be current on their rent. So the impact that you're going to see on credit loss is very minimal, right, because they're actually paying where you may see some sort of FFO impact is really on the straight line side, which although I wish that was cash, it's not, but there could be an FFO impact from that."

On the smaller redevelopment side, clearly, those are ones we get the best bang for our buck, where we're, on average, returning over 10% on invested capital. 
So we continue to monitor and mine the portfolio for those. Typically, it's adding a pad out in front with a drive-through or expanding a shopping center in some way, shape or form. And those continue to be right around, I would say, between $80 million to $100 million a year of capital investment. Now we'd love to do more of that. Clearly, it's some great returns on capital and we'll continue to try and look for those opportunities going forward. 
And then on the larger scale redevelopment projects, we continue to look through our portfolio and say, what's the best way to activate these on these projects, and we want to be mindful of the fact that we have a lot of opportunity, but there's different ways to structure those opportunities.

Those sometimes are multifamily projects or were joint ventured and done projects that add a nice live-work-play experience to the shopping center. So we'll continue to do that.

First, on the cap rate side. You guys did the prep deal in San Antonio. And just curious, when you -- as you guys see the acquisition market, are you seeing sellers may be reluctant to sell because either they want to stabilize their NOI or they view the cap rates or sell in which case we should expect to see more sort of partial investments like prep deals or JV stakes with the option to buy out eventually? Or do you see that sellers are willing to just outright transact even though there's a view that fundamentals are getting better and that cap rates are going to continue to compress?"

So as evidenced by the amount of transactions that have occurred, there are plenty of owners that are willing and have been executing on dispositions. They see that the market continues to work in their favor. The financeability of these assets has never been greater with interest rates where they are. So it is a very good time if you're a seller, to take advantage of all-time low interest rates and thus, cap rates. 
At the same time, there is an opportunity for owners that have the capital and the financial wherewithal to reinvest in assets to try to stabilize cash flows if they were be down a little bit during the COVID, depending on what type of tenancy they had. So you're seeing certain decisions potentially being delayed for a period of time. And you always have to compete with the opportunity for an owner to refinance their assets because, as I mentioned, the financeability of those assets is very much available. 
So every circumstance is unique, but we're finding plenty of opportunities. We do think that we'll continue to see structured investments with the preferred equity and the mezz financing present themselves. We'll continue to be very disciplined and only look to invest in those assets where we feel very good about the basis, our current return. And then, of course, it has to check the box as to an asset that we would potentially look to own in the future, and that's where we secure a right-of-first refusal or right-of-first offer. So we've intentionally not put out any sort of mandate on the amount that we're going to invest in that program. But to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, we're ready and excited to do that."

But I would say from a more macro level, the difference between preferred and mezzanine. In the preferred investments, we typically look for a high single-digit current return on our investment, but we do participate in the back-end profit assuming that the asset performs the way that we've underwritten, there's usually back-end participation that can juice that return somewhere into the teens from an IRR perspective. 
On the mezzanine financing, oftentimes, those are higher coupons, but don't necessarily have the back-end participation. So we're getting double digits current or sometimes even into the teens. But it very much depends on each asset. As it relates to the RIM, that one is a preferred equity investment. 
So like I said, we got very high single digits current. But when we look at the opportunity on that asset and some of the things that we think can occur in terms of occupancy increases and maybe some repositioning and just the general strength of that asset in the market, we think that we will certainly see some participation on the profit on the back end.

And maybe you mentioned something else about JVs, obviously, you know your JV assets better than others.

And I'm going to kind of keep it at a high level rather than commenting directly on the Weingarten specific questions. But there's no doubt that we think that there's still a disconnect between public and private pricing. When we look at NAVs of ourselves and some other peers versus, like you said, some of the transactions that are happening in the low 5s, and we're also starting to see them dipping into the high 4s. There is still very much a spread between those 2. But the Bentall and GreenOak portfolio, very high-quality, grocery-anchored product and it was not surprising to see a very strong demand and many bidders and multiple rounds of bidding before that deal was ultimately awarded. And I think we're going to continue to see more of that. 
In terms of partnership buyouts, I mean that is something that we have taken advantage of in the past. Oftentimes, it's difficult to model or forecast or predict. When those opportunities present themselves, all of our partners have different investment horizons and reasons for why they may look to exit, but we do stay ready. We stay in very close communication with our partners, and we have a pretty good sense as to when they may look to exit or what might trigger that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do think that there's going to be some of that in the relatively near future. 
And as it relates to our ability to have sort of a right-of-first offer, right-of-first refusal, there's no doubt that for these assets that we're managing and that we're operating day in and day out. We are the logical buyer. We can move quicker than any other third party can given the fact that we know the assets inside and out. 
So typically, it's a win-win. If it's an asset that we view as a long-term hold and for 1 reason or another, our partner is looking to exit, it's a great chance for us to buy out the remainder and for our partners to have a very smooth and quick execution. So again, we'll see more of that as time goes on over the next year or so."

We have -- since we've been virtual for most of this pandemic, we've been able to do more virtual portfolio reviews and talk with more tenants on the regular on expansion plans and looking for space throughout the portfolio. One thing -- you're right about the cadence there, but one thing we found is that many of our retailers that are well capitalized, have actually come to us and say, ""Hey, we actually need a few more deals for this year or we need -- so there's actually a bit of that going on as well. So it's broad-based, which I like to see. Clearly, grocery continues to expand and is quite hot. 
But then you've got the other categories that we like to see that complement the cross-shopping, which typically is led by off-price and then you've got the home improvement, home bid section continues to be very, very strong. And it goes on from there. The interesting part, I think, is the pent-up demand for probably the most impacted categories that we're seeing. So the entertainment, the fitness and the restaurant side of it have really come back strong, faster than we anticipated. And we think that, that bodes well for the recovery of those sectors. 
And obviously, we're not out of the woods yet, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and we want to be careful about how we talk about the future because we still got the Delta variant that's causing a lot of issues, but we have a playbook now. We have the Kimco branded curbside pickup program that's on the entire portfolio. And we have a battle-tested team that I think can really manage through this. And the customer is more aware of how to go about utilizing last mile retail in more ways than one. So I think our portfolio is well positioned to weather the -- whatever storm comes our way."

Today, I will share the highlights of the quarter, provide a recap of our now closed strategic merger with Weingarten and give an update on the strong leasing environment. Ross will give an update on the transaction market, and Glenn will cover our operating metrics in detail, discuss our improved balance sheet, Albertsons valuation and the proactive use of our ATM and how we can take advantage of opportunities in the market. We'll close with an updated outlook for the balance of the year. 
While we have only owned Weingarten for a partial quarter, our expanded portfolio of grocery-anchored and mixed-use properties is already validating our investment thesis. To date, we are exceeding our initial underwriting on all major metrics, including FFO, occupancy, spreads and renewal rates. As for synergies, as outlined in our earnings release, we have achieved the upper end of both ranges and anticipate achieving the full benefit of synergies by the end of 2022. 
Our dedicated team has done a remarkable job closing on the merger ahead of schedule and implementing an integration plan that included onboarding and training over 100 new employees, significant systems integration and property management, all while staying focused on executing our strategy. To all of my teammates, I just want to say, thank you. On the operational front, leasing demand continues to be robust across the portfolio with the bright spot being the rebound in demand for small shops. This was illustrated by the portfolio delivering another quarter of improved results, including a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Our pro rata U.S. occupancy is up 20 basis points to 94.1%, while anchor occupancy remained flat at 96.9%. Small shop occupancy rose 180 basis points over prior quarter to 87.3%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. 
New lease spreads were a positive 5%, with 141 new leases signed, totaling 605,000 square feet. Spreads for renewals and options finished at positive 4.9%. We closed the quarter with 270 renewals and options totaling 1.4 million square feet, exceeding the 5-year average number of renewals and options reported during the third quarter by 40% and exceeded average GLA renewed by 38%. 
Combined spreads for third quarter 2021 were positive 4.9%, with total 3Q '21 deal volume reaching 411 deals totaling 2,050,321 square feet. 411 leases executed represents the most transactions reported during a quarter since the first quarter of 2018. 
Our same-site NOI growth was positive 12.1%, including a 30 basis point contribution from redevelopments. The same-site population does not include the [indiscernible] site since we only had them for a partial quarter. With the continued strength in leasing, we have maintained our 300 basis point spread of leased versus economic occupancy similar to last quarter. 
As of September 30, 2021, we had over 400 signed leases representing $44.8 million of pro rata annualized base rents awaiting rent commencement. While the operating environment remains favorable, we cannot let down our guard, inflation, supply chain issues in the labor market together or alone can impact our business, and that is why we continue to look for the most resilient assets, improve operational efficiencies and seek out ways to help our tenants succeed. We continue to grow our portfolio in the high-growth Sunbelt markets and are committed to being the last-mile solution for tenants. There is no question that our mission-critical last-mile brick-and-mortar locations are proving to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end customer. In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that we have positioned Kimco for sustainable growth over the long term with a combination of internal and external growth levers. Our talented and deep team is focused on execution as we're in a unique position to take advantage of a wide range of opportunities. We continue to believe we're building something special, and the best is yet to come. Ross?"

It's been quite an exciting quarter at Kimco, and the excitement has continued into the fourth quarter, as I will discuss shortly. There is no question that open-air shopping centers provide one of the best risk-adjusted returns of all asset classes. We continue to see additional capital sources, new and old, gaining conviction in quality open-air retail, leading to the compression of cap rates. We are fortunate to be in a position with multiple investment strategies that enable us to be active when opportunities arise, but also patient when things become too frothy. With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in a portfolio of 6 public-anchored Sunbelt region shopping centers from our existing joint venture partner, Jamestown, for a gross purchase price of $425.8 million. The public-anchored assets represent over 1.2 million square feet of gross leasable area in infill markets throughout the Southeast, with 5 located in the top-performing South Florida market and 1 in the high-growth Atlanta market. Subsequently, Kimco entered into a joint venture partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, under which we will both own 50% and Kimco will continue to manage the portfolio. 
It is rare to have the ability to buy a portfolio like this with short-term mark-to-market opportunities and exceptional tenant sales. We are thrilled to be partnering with Blackstone again on our new strategic venture. Also post quarter end and in line with our value creation strategy, we were successful in buying out our partner's 85% interest in 2 grocery-anchored centers in California. Anaheim Plaza is one of the jewels of our Southern California portfolio with extraordinary highway visibility in frontage and 2 grocery anchors at the same property both performing exceptionally well. 
The second asset is Brookvale Shopping Center located in Fremont, California anchored by a lucky supermarket in CVS. The gross purchase price of the 2 assets was $134 million. 
Turning to our redevelopment program. It continues to move ahead, beginning with property level entitlements and then selectively and creatively activating a few at a time. While the structure and exit strategy are determined on a case-by-case basis, we see the upside knowing these infill locations are being built at a significant relative spread to the stabilized cap rate. Comps in multifamily, industrial and other asset classes are regularly transacting with cap rates starting in the 2s and 3s. Additionally, we're continuing our structured investment program with a disciplined approach and an emphasis placed on location, demographics, quality of tenancy and operational strength of the sponsors. We view the base case of these investments as a true win-win, either generating an attractive return with a repayment down the road or exercising our right of first refusal and owning the properties outright. 
On that front, we completed a $21.5 million mezzanine financing on a strong performing center in San Antonio called Alamo Ranch. In just a few short months, San Antonio has gone from a market that was on our target list at Kimco to a major contributor in our portfolio with the Weingarten merger and now our second structured investment there. We continue to pursue additional opportunities in San Antonio, one of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. We also sold 3 small low-growth assets this quarter. Two single tenant boxes and an undeveloped parcel for a total of $23.5 million at a flat 5% cap. While dispositions will remain a relatively small component of our investment strategy, we will be prudent in disposing of low-growth assets and undeveloped parcels from which we can redeploy the capital. To repeat Conor's statement, we are confident that the best is yet to come. Off to Glenn for the financials."
320371,1679962671,2427319,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results.

We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site NOI growth, increased collections and lower credit loss. Our balance sheet metrics are also at the strongest levels ever. As you might expect, the completion of the $5.9 billion Weingarten merger, which closed in early August was a key contributor. While we did not have a full quarter of contribution from the addition of the Weingarten portfolio, the benefits are clearly apparent. Our team has put in enormous effort to accomplish the successful integration of Weingarten in a very short period of time. Many thanks to our highly motivated and skilled team. We couldn't be prouder. Now for some details on our third quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses. This compares to the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds. The increase in FFO was primarily driven by higher NOI of $98.7 million, of which the Weingarten merger contributed $62.6 million. 
In addition, NOI benefited from lower credit loss of $30.7 million and higher straight-line rent of $14.5 million, including $2 million from the Weingarten portfolio. Improvements in collections and new leases commencing during the quarter were the major contributors. Specifically, during the third quarter, we collected approximately 98% of base rents. We also collected 80% of rents due from cash basis tenants, up from 77% last quarter. Furthermore, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $8 million during the third quarter of 2021. Our cash basis tenants comprise 9.1% of pro rata annualized base rents. If we excluded the addition of the Weingarten cash basis tenants, this amount would have been 7.3%, which compares favorably to the 8.8% level reported last quarter. 
In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Weingarten transaction, the debt we assumed was recorded at a fair value, which was $107 million higher than the face amount. This resulted in $6.2 million of fair market value amortization for the third quarter, which reduces interest expense and is also part of the FFO improvement. We expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by year-end. During the third quarter, FFO also included approximately $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to onetime contributions from several joint ventures and higher lease termination fees. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had an active quarter in the capital markets. We issued a new $500 million unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.25%, the lowest coupon for 10-year unsecured financing in the company's history. Proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and the merger costs. We also opportunistically used our ATM equity program to issue 3.5 million shares of common stock, raising almost $77 million in net proceeds to fund some of the investment activity Ross just mentioned. This is in addition to the 179.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Weingarten merger valued at $3.7 billion. We also assumed $1.8 billion of debt, including the fair value adjustment as part of the Weingarten merger. 
Total common shares outstanding at quarter end was 616.4 million, and we expect this should be a good guide for the fourth quarter. As anticipated, the Weingarten merger was a deleveraging event. As of September 30, net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis, including pro rata share of joint venture debt and preferred stock outstanding was 7x. This metric only includes 2 months of EBITDA from the Weingarten merger, but all of [indiscernible]. 
On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of EBITDA from Weingarten, look through net debt-to-EBITDA would be 6.3x, representing the lowest level since we began tracking this metric. 
Our liquidity position also remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $450 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, the value of our Albertsons marketable security investment climbed to more than $1.2 billion after increasing by $457 million, which is included in net income but not FFO for the quarter. We continue to evaluate our opportunities to begin the Albertsons monetization process. As we look ahead during 2022, we will have a variety of potential uses for the capital from the redemption of our preferred stock issuances that become callable, bonds that mature in October and November of 2022 and accretive investment opportunities. 
As our overall business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic and as we begin to benefit from the successful merger and integration of the Weingarten portfolio, we are raising our full year 2021 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, which includes $0.10 per diluted share of merger-related costs and the inclusion of the Weingarten portfolio for 5 months. This compares to previous NAREIT FFO per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.33, which did not include any impact from the Weingarten merger except $0.01 related to merger costs. As I touched upon, our third quarter FFO includes a total of $0.03 per share related to items that were more onetime in nature and which were not budgeted for as recurring items. 
This includes $0.02 per diluted share from improvements in credit loss and another $0.01 from contributions from joint ventures and lease termination fees. We will provide initial 2022 guidance on our next earnings call. 
And with that, we're happy to now take your questions."

Some quarters, you could have significantly below market leases that roll and you execute and obviously, you'll get a real net benefit out of that. This quarter, we had an outsized amount of small shop volume that came through, which is typically closer to market. So that's where you see that sub-5% range. for this quarter, but it's not indicative necessarily what could happen next quarter if you have some outsized anchor activity that has a significant below market value that [indiscernible] can recapture.

So as it relates to the venture with Blackstone, I mean, these are clearly 6 assets that we felt very strongly about between the location pull books being 1 of the best grocery anchors that you could possibly have with exceptional sales, as I mentioned in the script, having near-term mark-to-market opportunities in public-anchored centers is somewhat rare. So when you look at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with public. So we're really excited about that. We're really excited about sort of reengaging our venture with Blackstone after a very successful 1 several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise. We look at every single asset, every single space taking into consideration the growth in the market, the demographics, where the population growth is coming from and just making sure that we have very strong conviction in our ability to push rents. 
We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have outsized growth. So the ones that you do see us on the trigger on, you can rest assured that we believe very strongly, now we're going to be able to push that outsized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So I don't think that there's anything specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or a portfolio -- It's really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space and feel pretty good that there's below-market leases that we can push over time."

And I think where we are today is there's so much pent-up on the open-to-buy side for retailers. So you have some retailers that have really expanded the breadth of their offering in multiple brands that they're looking to expand. TJX being a great example and they actually increased their open-to-buy targets. So that just makes them more competitive for space. They want space they need to grow. I think COVID, the silver lining through COVID is that brick-and-mortar is essential for any omnichannel strategy. Retailers have really come to appreciate that customers have appreciated that. It's a great form of distribution. The margins are better there. And then thirdly, obviously, there is no new development supply coming online. It's really COVID inventory that's getting absorbed. So of that third point, I think, generally speaking, as more of that gets absorbed, you're able to push rents further north. That said to Conor's point earlier, we are seeing rent progressions in the Sunbelt and coastal markets. Southern California, for example, is becoming extremely competitive, where we are seeing some nice traction pushing that rent forward even beyond where we were prepandemic levels. But I'd say, generally speaking, you're in a very healthy environment from a landlord perspective as a result of all those variables."

Again, they see, I think, all retailers see this opportunity where it's a short window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share in certain areas that pre-pandemic, there was no inventory available. And so you do have this COVID inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them. But what I found was actually interesting, this last quarter, when we go back to our small shop activity is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants and the fast casual side on the small shop side. So it's nice to see that the fast casual QSRs are coming back the crumble cookies of the world, et cetera. So you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID starts the Coven anxiety starts to subside. People want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize or for social features, that's creating that opportunity on the foodservice side. Fitness, the value-oriented Fitness Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on, several quarters ago that plant and Crunchy been very proactive in wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. But you're also seeing that now extend out in the boutique fitness category. So that's again attracting the small shops. So you're really seeing it from a variety of areas. And then people are playing with formats. We have Bob's Discount who's experimenting with a smaller format right now.

So for us, I mean, we really view it as a significant level of optionality. And we've said, even as we've been sort of skinnying down our joint venture exposure over the last 7 or 8 years, on the Kimco side, we've had 3 very strong long-term partners that we continue to do business with. And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically, if there is a reason to bring in a new partner like we felt here on this particular transaction. But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able to be able to have that discussion with them hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be ready to take advantage of that if the partner is looking to exit. So 1 of the nice benefits that we see in the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just 3 major partners on the Kimco side there are now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term business with Kimco and we welcome that. others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the table or monetize their retail investments, and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well. And we are having those conversations as we speak. So for us, given all the levers that we have, Conor mentioned and Glenn both mentioned in their prepared remarks, between the significant amount of cash, availability on our credit facility, ultimately, Albertsons monetization opportunity, We'll just be very prudent and selective with where we want to utilize that capital, but having a lot of term ways to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."

I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. it's -- we don't really know what that will look like long term. But I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there, too, which also then creates that opportunity to engage in open air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all of our portfolio resides. So we're seeing that benefit as well. And that could probably carry longer term into the market. So I think you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years sort of come to a head and now creating this environment that we're in today. 
So going forward, I think you continue to see the open to buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that COVID inventory. And then from there, I think the consumer is in a very strong position right now to take advantage of that."

Second of that, though, on the coastal market, for that remaining, say, 48% of leases signed, it was heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. So I think you still see that high demand there. So between that, the [indiscernible] Sunbelt that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that, too, like Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to penetrate. So the scope of inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents further north. 
In the Northeast, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And so it's just there are natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well. And people wanting to penetrate Long Island, for example, I think we'll continue to be difficult.

So if you think about the REIT rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate-related items. So that leaves about -- you have a 5% bad income bucket and then you have the other 20% that could be interest and dividends and capital gains. So the governor is going to be how much our gross revenues are. And our gross revenues today on a look-forward basis with the merger, somewhere around $1.8 billion. So monetization-wise, about somewhere around 350 million to 400 million a year of gain is what we could absorb today. The larger the gross revenue number is the more we can do. But I would say today that we're looking at somewhere around $400 million on an annual basis is what we can do."

I think we believe that our dispositions program will continue to be just a pruning of select assets for a variety of reasons. I did mention how there are several joint venture partners that we have that might be looking to exit. So we have conversations with them every day. Many of the assets of which we're talking to them about potentially buying out their position, depending on where that pricing is or the quality of those assets, some of them differ we may be market sellers if we think the pricing is too aggressive or the asset just doesn't necessarily fit the growth profile for the portfolio. So you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio, both on buyouts and some potential select dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time or if we're better off recycling that capital selling from nonincome-producing assets and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities. 
So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's going to be a tremendous component of our capital stack."

So that should start to be reflected in the coming quarters. 
And then the second part of that is obviously our signature program. The one project we did activate earlier on was the Milton, the second tower at the Pentagon, where we had recently completed the Wimer, and that's the 250-residential unit project. And when we look at those projects going forward, we have a real menu of options. We have over 4,000 entitled residential units that we can draw upon now. Our goal is to obviously expand the entitled and the built population to over 10,000 and to 12,000 in the next 5 years. So we'll look at those selectively and determine at what point in time it makes sense to activate them and at what structure.

You're also seeing others like some of the grocers that are actually repurposing some of their square footage within the 4 walls to utilize for last-mile fulfillment and micro fulfillment. And so they'll actually receive the goods from the loading dock and then split and distribute them to do different categories, 1 goes to the floor to sell the customers and walk into the store, while the balance goes to the micro fulfillment facility, which is actually within their existing 4 walls. 
And I think what you're seeing right now is all the retailers that have the means experimenting with what works best for them. I can't say that I'm an expert on supply chain logistics and distribution, but I know it's extremely complex. And so it's really about foundationally how they're set up.

So if you think of the land values where we're located. So if you look at our portfolio map, that's the main reason why we transformed our portfolio to where it sits today is because we wanted to be in locations that have high barriers to entry. So when the supply cycle does come back, it's very hard to make a pencil to go and buy land and develop a shopping center that would compete with one of Kimco's. You've got to look at the, obviously, the FAR as well in terms of the build versus the parking lot. And that's, again, another barrier to entry in these dense areas. You just don't have the luxury of putting 80% of your property as a parking lot and not generating any revenues from that. And so we're watching it closely. We do think there's a good amount of slack still to be absorbed from the pandemic, and we're experiencing that throughout our portfolio. 
But to your point, if rents get to a point where they justify new development, it should start to happen. We haven't seen it yet, but those barriers to entry is why we've positioned our portfolio where it is because we don't want to be sitting in an asset that has tremendous amount of unbuilt dirt around it where you can have a competitor come quickly reposition you.

While we have only owned Weingarten for a partial quarter, our expanded portfolio of grocery-anchored and mixed-use properties is already validating our investment thesis. To date, we are exceeding our initial underwriting on all major metrics, including FFO, occupancy, spreads and renewal rates. As for synergies, as outlined in our earnings release, we have achieved the upper end of both ranges and anticipate achieving the full benefit of synergies by the end of 2022. 
Our dedicated team has done a remarkable job closing on the merger ahead of schedule and implementing an integration plan that included onboarding and training over 100 new employees, significant systems integration and property management, all while staying focused on executing our strategy. To all of my teammates, I just want to say, thank you. 
On the operational front, leasing demand continues to be robust across the portfolio with the bright spot being the rebound in demand for small shops. This was illustrated by the portfolio delivering another quarter of improved results, including a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Our pro-rata U.S. occupancy is up 20 basis points to 94.1%, while anchor occupancy remained flat at 96.9%. And small shop occupancy rose 180 basis points over prior quarter to 87.3%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. 
New lease spreads were a positive 5%, with 141 new leases signed, totaling 605,000 square feet. Spreads for renewals and options finished at positive 4.9%. We closed the quarter with 270 renewals and options totaling 1.4 million square feet, exceeding the 5-year average number of renewals and options reported during the third quarter by 40% and exceeded average GLA renewed by 38%. 
Combined spreads for third quarter 2021 were positive 4.9% and with total 3Q, '21 deal volume reaching 411 deals totaling 2,050,321 square feet. 411 leases executed represents the most transactions reported during a quarter since the first quarter of 2018. 
Our same-site NOI growth was positive 12.1%, including a 30 basis point contribution from redevelopments. The same-site population does not include the Weingarten sites since we only had them for a partial quarter. With the continued strength in leasing, we have maintained our 300 basis point spread of leased versus economic occupancy similar to last quarter. 
As of September 30, 2021, we had over 400 signed leases representing $44.8 million of pro-rata annualized base rents awaiting rent commencement. While the operating environment remains favorable, we cannot let down our guard, inflation, supply chain issues in the labor market, together or alone, can impact our business, and that is why we continue to look for the most resilient assets, improve operational efficiencies and seek out ways to help our tenants succeed. 
We continue to grow our portfolio in the high-growth Sunbelt markets and are committed to being the last-mile solution for tenants. There is no question that our mission-critical, last-mile brick-and-mortar locations are proving to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end customer. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that we have positioned Kimco for sustainable growth over the long term with a combination of internal and external growth levers. Our talented and deep team is focused on execution as we're in a unique position to take advantage of a wide range of opportunities. We continue to believe we're building something special, and the best is yet to come. Ross?"

It's been quite an exciting quarter at Kimco, and the excitement has continued into the fourth quarter, as I will discuss shortly. There is no question that open-air shopping centers provide one of the best risk-adjusted returns of all asset classes. We continue to see additional capital sources, new and old, gaining conviction in quality open-air retail, leading to the compression of cap rates. We are fortunate to be in a position with multiple investment strategies that enable us to be active when opportunities arise, but also patient when things become too frothy. 
With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in a portfolio of 6 Publix-anchored Sunbelt-region shopping centers from our existing joint venture partner, Jamestown, for a gross purchase price of $425.8 million. The Publix-anchored assets represent over 1.2 million square feet of gross leasable area in infill markets throughout the Southeast, with 5 located in the top-performing South Florida market and 1 in the high-growth Atlanta market. Subsequently, Kimco entered into a joint venture partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, under which we will both own 50% and Kimco will continue to manage the portfolio. 
It is rare to have the ability to buy a portfolio like this with short-term mark-to-market opportunities and exceptional tenant sales. We are thrilled to be partnering with Blackstone again on our new strategic venture. Also post quarter end and in line with our value creation strategy, we were successful in buying out our partner's 85% interest in 2 grocery-anchored centers in California. Anaheim Plaza is one of the jewels of our Southern California portfolio with extraordinary highway visibility in frontage and 2 grocery anchors at the same property both performing exceptionally well. 
The second asset is Brookvale Shopping Center located in Fremont, California anchored by a lucky supermarket in CVS. The gross purchase price of the 2 assets was $134 million. 
Turning to our redevelopment program. It continues to move ahead, beginning with property-level entitlements and then selectively and creatively activating a few at a time. While the structure and exit strategy are determined on a case-by-case basis, we see the upside knowing these infill locations are being built at a significant relative spread to the stabilized cap rate. 
Comps in multifamily, industrial and other asset classes are regularly transacting with cap rates starting in the 2s and 3s. Additionally, we're continuing our structured investment program with a disciplined approach and an emphasis placed on location, demographics, quality of tenancy and operational strength of the sponsors. We view the base case of these investments as a true win-win, either generating an attractive return with a repayment down the road or exercising our right of first refusal and owning the properties outright. 
On that front, we completed a $21.5 million mezzanine financing on a strong performing center in San Antonio called Alamo Ranch. In just a few short months, San Antonio has gone from a market that was on our target list at Kimco to a major contributor in our portfolio with the Weingarten merger and now our second structured investment there. We continue to pursue additional opportunities in San Antonio, 1 of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. 
We also sold 3 small low-growth assets this quarter. Two single tenant boxes and an undeveloped parcel for a total of $23.5 million at a flat 5% cap. While dispositions will remain a relatively small component of our investment strategy, we will be prudent in disposing of low-growth assets and undeveloped parcels from which we can redeploy the capital. 
To repeat Conor's statement, we are confident that the best is yet to come. Off to Glenn for the financials."

We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site NOI growth, increased collections and lower credit loss. 
Our balance sheet metrics are also at the strongest levels ever. As you might expect, the completion of the $5.9 billion Weingarten merger, which closed in early August was a key contributor. While we did not have a full quarter of contribution from the addition of the Weingarten portfolio, the benefits are clearly apparent. Our team has put in enormous effort to accomplish the successful integration of Weingarten in a very short period of time. 
Many thanks to our highly motivated and skilled team. We couldn't be prouder. Now for some details on our third quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses. This compares to the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds. The increase in FFO was primarily driven by higher NOI of $98.7 million, of which the Weingarten merger contributed $62.6 million. 
In addition, NOI benefited from lower credit loss of $30.7 million and higher straight-line rent of $14.5 million, including $2 million from the Weingarten portfolio. Improvements in collections and new leases commencing during the quarter were the major contributors. Specifically, during the third quarter, we collected approximately 98% of base rents. 
We also collected 80% of rents due from cash basis tenants, up from 77% last quarter. Furthermore, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $8 million during the third quarter of 2021. Our cash basis tenants comprise 9.1% of pro-rata annualized base rents. If we excluded the addition of the Weingarten cash basis tenants, this amount would have been 7.3%, which compares favorably to the 8.8% level reported last quarter. 
In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Weingarten transaction, the debt we assumed was recorded at a fair value, which was $107 million higher than the face amount. This resulted in $6.2 million of fair market value amortization for the third quarter, which reduces interest expense and is also part of the FFO improvement. We expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by year-end. During the third quarter, FFO also included approximately $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to onetime contributions from several joint ventures and higher lease termination fees. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had an active quarter in the capital markets. We issued a new $500 million unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.25%, the lowest coupon for 10-year unsecured financing in the company's history. Proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and the merger costs. 
We also opportunistically used our ATM equity program to issue 3.5 million shares of common stock, raising almost $77 million in net proceeds to fund some of the investment activity Ross just mentioned. This is in addition to the 179.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Weingarten merger valued at $3.7 billion. We also assumed $1.8 billion of debt, including the fair value adjustment as part of the Weingarten merger. 
Total common shares outstanding at quarter end was 616.4 million, and we expect this should be a good guide for the fourth quarter. As anticipated, the Weingarten merger was a deleveraging event. As of September 30, net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of joint venture debt and preferred stock outstanding was 7x. This metric only includes 2 months of EBITDA from the Weingarten merger, but all of the debt assumed. 
On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of EBITDA from Weingarten, look through net debt-to-EBITDA would be 6.3x, representing the lowest level since we began tracking this metric. 
Our liquidity position also remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $450 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, the value of our Albertsons marketable security investment climbed to more than $1.2 billion after increasing by $457 million, which is included in net income but not FFO for the quarter. We continue to evaluate our opportunities to begin the Albertsons monetization process. 
As we look ahead during 2022, we will have a variety of potential uses for the capital from the redemption of our preferred stock issuances that become callable, bonds that mature in October and November of 2022 and accretive investment opportunities. 
As our overall business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic and as we begin to benefit from the successful merger and integration of the Weingarten portfolio, we are raising our full year 2021 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, which includes $0.10 per diluted share of merger-related costs and the inclusion of the Weingarten portfolio for 5 months. 
This compares to previous NAREIT FFO per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.33, which did not include any impact from the Weingarten merger except $0.01 related to merger costs. As I touched upon, our third quarter FFO includes a total of $0.03 per share related to items that were more onetime in nature and which were not budgeted for as recurring items. 
This includes $0.02 per diluted share from improvements in credit loss and another $0.01 from contributions from joint ventures and lease termination fees. We will provide initial 2022 guidance on our next earnings call. 
And with that, we're happy to now take your questions."

Some quarters, you could have significantly below market leases that roll and you execute and obviously, you'll get a real net benefit out of that. This quarter, we had an outsized amount of small-shop volume that came through, which is typically closer to market. So that's where you see that sub-5% range for this quarter, but it's not indicative necessarily what could happen next quarter if you have some outsized anchor activity that has a significant below market value that you can then -- you can recapture. 
So when you look at what we've been doing over the last trailing to 8 quarters and maintaining that positive spread, there is some volatility in that number, and it's really just indicative of what's rolling."

So as it relates to the venture with Blackstone, I mean, these are clearly 6 assets that we felt very strongly about. Between the location, Publix being 1 of the best grocery anchors that you could possibly have with exceptional sales, as I mentioned in the script, having near-term mark-to-market opportunities in Publix-anchored centers is somewhat rare. So when you look at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with Publix. 
So we're really excited about that. We're really excited about sort of reengaging our venture with Blackstone after a very successful 1 several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise. We look at every single asset, every single space taking into consideration the growth in the market, the demographics, where the population growth is coming from and just making sure that we have very strong conviction in our ability to push rents. 
We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have outsized growth. So the ones that you do see us pulling the trigger on, you can -- rest assured that we believe very strongly, now we're going to be able to push that outsized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So I don't think that there's anything specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or a portfolio -- It's really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space and feel pretty good that there's below-market leases that we can push over time."

And I think where we are today is there's so much pent-up demand on the open-to-buy side for retailers. So you have some retailers that have really expanded the breadth of their offering in multiple brands that they're looking to expand. TJX being a great example and they actually increased their open-to-buy targets. So that just makes them more competitive for space. They want space they need to grow. 
I think COVID -- the silver lining through COVID is that brick-and-mortar is essential for any omnichannel strategy. Retailers have really come to appreciate that customers have appreciated that. It's a great form of distribution. The margins are better there. And then thirdly, obviously, there is no new development supply coming online. It's really COVID inventory that's getting absorbed. So to that third point, I think, generally speaking, as more of that gets absorbed, you're able to push rents further north. 
That said to Conor's point earlier, we are seeing rent progressions in the Sunbelt and coastal markets. Southern California, for example, is becoming extremely competitive, where we are seeing some nice traction pushing that rent forward even beyond where we were pre-pandemic levels. But I'd say, generally speaking, you're in a very healthy environment from a landlord perspective as a result of all those variables."

Grocery is the obvious one. They're the clear beneficiary of the pandemic. They now have a surplus of cash that they're looking to reinvest in their 4 walls, expand their open-to-buy, grab market share and really invest towards the future, so how do they create better connectivity with the customers. So that's going to be really important for them as well as all sectors. 
Off-price, as I mentioned earlier, with TJ [indiscernible], Farlington and others, maybe, they're all actively expanding their footprint. Again, they see, I think, all retailers see this opportunity where it's a short window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share in certain areas that pre-pandemic, there was no inventory available. And so you do have this COVID inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them. 
But what I found that was actually interesting, this last quarter, when we go back to our small shop activity is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants and the fast casual side on the small shop side. So it's nice to see that the fast casual QSRs are coming back. The crumble cookies of the world, et cetera. So you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID starts -- the COVID anxiety starts to subside, people want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize or for social features, that's creating that opportunity on the foodservice side. 
Fitness, the value-oriented fitness, Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on, several quarters ago that Plant and [indiscernible] have been very proactive in wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. [Audio Gap] But you're also seeing that now extend out in the boutique fitness category. So that's again attracting the small shops. So you're really seeing it from a variety of areas. And then people are playing with formats. We have Bob's Discount who's experimenting with a smaller format right now. 
So it's giving them optionality appreciating that they may be able to provide different service offerings to different customers in different areas. And so it's important that they have a [indiscernible] to play from."

But as these tenants start to come online and open, you are going to start to see that compression set in through the back half of '22 and into '23. 
And then I believe our normalized rate was about 170 basis points on spread. I don't think you see that for a period of time, but you are right. To your points about supply and opening is something that we watch very, very closely. We work hand-in-hand with our tenants. We have a very substantial tenant coordination program. which really is designed to shepherd tenants through the permitting and build-out process, those that don't have the resources available to them to address all of these issues that are coming out to the market. Obviously, that's been really helpful. 
In addition to that, we're trying to get well ahead on preordering of supplies and materials when we can, when it makes sense. We all lived through the backlog.

So we're just eyes wide open about that process, and we'll manage it as best we can and apply the resources that we need to do to get it done."

So obviously, you can do that at scale, that's a good thing for both parties, but also helps us progress the conversation beyond that. Retailers are trying to figure out and innovate and change to become and stay more relevant to the customer.

And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically, if there is a reason to bring in a new partner like we felt here on this particular transaction. 
But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able to be able to have that discussion with them hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be ready to take advantage of that if the partner is looking to exit. So 1 of the nice benefits that we see in the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just 3 major partners on the Kimco side there are now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term business with Kimco and we welcome that. 
Others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the table or monetize their retail investments, and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well.

It goes into this very complex network of how to distribute goods from the retailer to the customer. 
And so I think COVID, the irony of COVID was it sort of validated that open air was really essential. It's closest to the customer. I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. it's -- we don't really know what that will look like long term. But I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there, too, which also then creates that opportunity to engage in open air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all of our portfolio resides. 
So we're seeing that benefit as well. And that could probably carry longer term into the market. So I think you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years sort of come to a head and now creating this environment that we're in today. 
So going forward, I think you continue to see the open to buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that COVID inventory. And then from there, I think the consumer is in a very strong position right now to take advantage of that."

I'd suggest we all buy early. We don't want to disappoint any of our loved ones during the holiday season. And what that means to, that means, as a result, that retailers can probably have fewer promotions. So there's a smaller promotional window, which helps drive top line revenues, which is a net benefit to them.

So just thinking of geographic's first because you mentioned that the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt markets. And then within that, the substantial majority, we're actually coastal some belt. So I think you will continue to see that trend progress over the next couple of years. 
That is where population growth is continuing to rise greater than the rest of the country. Second of that, though, on the coastal market, for that remaining, say, 48% of leases signed, it was heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. So I think you still see that high demand there. So between that, the coastal and Sunbelt that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that, too, like Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to penetrate. So the scope of inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents further north. 
In the Northeast, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And so it's just there are natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well. And people wanting to penetrate Long Island, for example, I think will continue to be difficult. So when there is an opportunity, you do see multiple bidders at the table wanting to enter the market. And then -- so I think that's what you continue to see play out over the next couple of years."

I think there's a few components that we have to look at when it comes to Albertsons because of the significant increase in its value. Keep in mind, our basis is incredibly low, right?

So if you think about the REIT rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate-related items. 
So that leaves about -- you have a 5% bad income bucket and then you have the other 20% that could be interest and dividends and capital gains. So the governor is going to be how much our gross revenues are. And our gross revenues today on a look-forward basis with the merger, somewhere around $1.8 billion. So monetization-wise, about somewhere around $350 million to $400 million a year of gain is what we could absorb today. The larger the gross revenue number is the more we can do.

So you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio, both on buyouts and some potential select dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time or if we're better off recycling that capital selling from nonincome-producing assets and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities. 
So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's going to be a tremendous component of our capital stack."

So if you think of the land values where we're located. So if you look at our portfolio map, that's the main reason why we transformed our portfolio to where it sits today is because we wanted to be in locations that have high barriers to entry. So when the supply cycle does come back, it's very hard to make a pencil to go and buy land and develop a shopping center that would compete with one of Kimco's. 
You've got to look at the, obviously, the FAR as well in terms of the build versus the parking lot. And that's, again, another barrier to entry in these dense areas. You just don't have the luxury of putting 80% of your property as a parking lot and not generating any revenues from that. And so we're watching it closely. We do think there's a good amount of slack still to be absorbed from the pandemic, and we're experiencing that throughout our portfolio. 
But to your point, if rents get to a point where they justify new a development, it should start to happen. We haven't seen it yet, but those barriers to entry is why we've positioned our portfolio where it is because we don't want to be sitting in an asset that has tremendous amount of unbuilt dirt around it where you can have a competitor come quickly reposition you. And so that's why we've done a lot of work to be in the position we are today."

Today, I will share the highlights of the quarter, provide a recap of our now closed strategic merger with Weingarten and give an update on the strong leasing environment. Ross will give an update on the transaction market, and Glenn will cover our operating metrics in detail, discuss our improved balance sheet, Albertsons valuation and the proactive use of our ATM and how we can take advantage of opportunities in the market. He'll close with an updated outlook for the balance of the year. 
While we have only owned Weingarten for a partial quarter, our expanded portfolio of grocery-anchored and mixed-use properties is already validating our investment thesis. To date, we are exceeding our initial underwriting on all major metrics, including FFO, occupancy, spreads and renewal rates. As for synergies, as outlined in our earnings release, we have achieved the upper end of both ranges and anticipate achieving the full benefit of synergies by the end of 2022. 
Our dedicated team has done a remarkable job closing on the merger ahead of schedule and implementing an integration plan that included onboarding and training over 100 new employees, significant systems integration and property management, all while staying focused on executing our strategy. To all of my teammates, I just want to say thank you. 
On the operational front, leasing demand continues to be robust across the portfolio, with the bright spot being the rebound in demand for small shops. This was illustrated by the portfolio delivering another quarter of improved results, including a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Our pro-rata U.S. occupancy is up 20 basis points to 94.1%, while anchor occupancy remained flat at 96.9%. Small shop occupancy rose 180 basis points over prior quarter to 87.3%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. 
New lease spreads were a positive 5%, with 141 new leases signed, totaling 605,000 square feet. Spreads for renewals and options finished at positive 4.9%. We closed the quarter with 270 renewals and options totaling 1.4 million square feet, exceeding the 5-year average number of renewals and options reported during the third quarter by 40% and exceeded average GLA renewed by 38%. 
 
Combined spreads for third quarter 2021 were positive 4.9%, with total 3Q '21 deal volume reaching 411 deals totaling 2,050,321 square feet. 411 leases executed represents the most transactions reported during a quarter since the first quarter of 2018. 
 
Our same-site NOI growth was positive 12.1%, including a 30 basis point contribution from redevelopments. The same-site population does not include the Weingarten sites since we only had them for a partial quarter. With the continued strength in leasing, we have maintained our 300 basis point spread of leased versus economic occupancy similar to last quarter. 
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had over 400 signed leases representing $44.8 million of pro-rata annualized base rents awaiting rent commencement. While the operating environment remains favorable, we cannot let down our guard. Inflation, supply chain issues in the labor market, together or alone, can impact our business, and that is why we continue to look for the most resilient assets, improve operational efficiencies and seek out ways to help our tenants succeed. 
We continue to grow our portfolio in the high-growth Sunbelt markets and are committed to being the last-mile solution for tenants. There is no question that our mission-critical, last-mile brick-and-mortar locations are proving to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end customer. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that we have positioned Kimco for sustainable growth over the long term with a combination of internal and external growth levers. Our talented and deep team is focused on execution as we're in a unique position to take advantage of a wide range of opportunities. We continue to believe we're building something special, and the best is yet to come. Ross?"
320371,1679962671,2447457,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Conor, and good morning.

It's been quite an exciting quarter at Kimco, and the excitement has continued into the fourth quarter, as I will discuss shortly. There is no question that open-air shopping centers provide one of the best risk-adjusted returns of all asset classes. We continue to see additional capital sources, new and old, gaining conviction in quality open-air retail, leading to the compression of cap rates. We are fortunate to be in a position with multiple investment strategies that enable us to be active when opportunities arise, but also patient when things become too frothy. 
With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities. 
 
Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in a portfolio of 6 Publix-anchored Sunbelt-region shopping centers from our existing joint venture partner, Jamestown, for a gross purchase price of $425.8 million. The Publix-anchored assets represent over 1.2 million square feet of gross leasable area in infill markets throughout the Southeast, with 5 located in the top-performing South Florida market and 1 in the high-growth Atlanta market. 
Subsequently, Kimco entered into a joint venture partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, under which we will both own 50% and Kimco will continue to manage the portfolio. It is rare to have the ability to buy a portfolio like this with short-term mark-to-market opportunities and exceptional tenant sales. We are thrilled to be partnering with Blackstone again on our new strategic venture.  
Also post quarter end and in line with our value creation strategy, we were successful in buying out our partner's 85% interest in 2 grocery-anchored centers in California. Anaheim Plaza is one of the jewels of our Southern California portfolio with extraordinary highway visibility in frontage and 2 grocery anchors at the same property, both performing exceptionally well. The second asset is Brookvale Shopping Center located in Fremont, California anchored by a Lucky's supermarket and CVS. The gross purchase price of the 2 assets was $134 million. 
 
Turning to our redevelopment program. It continues to move ahead, beginning with property-level entitlements and then selectively and creatively activating a few at a time. While the structure and exit strategy are determined on a case-by-case basis, we see the upside knowing these infill locations are being built at a significant relative spread to the stabilized cap rate. Comps in multifamily, industrial and other asset classes are regularly transacting with cap rates starting in the 2s and 3s. 
Additionally, we're continuing our structured investment program with a disciplined approach and an emphasis placed on location, demographics, quality of tenancy and operational strength of the sponsors. We view the base case of these investments as a true win-win, either generating an attractive return with a repayment down the road or exercising our right of first refusal and owning the properties outright. 
 
On that front, we completed a $21.5 million mezzanine financing on a strong performing center in San Antonio called Alamo Ranch. In just a few short months, San Antonio has gone from a market that was on our target list at Kimco to a major contributor in our portfolio with the Weingarten merger and now our second structured investment there. We continue to pursue additional opportunities in San Antonio, one of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. 
We also sold 3 small low-growth assets this quarter, two single tenant boxes and an undeveloped parcel for a total of $23.5 million at a flat 5% cap. While dispositions will remain a relatively small component of our investment strategy, we will be prudent in disposing of low-growth assets and undeveloped parcels from which we can redeploy the capital. 
To repeat Conor's statement, we are confident that the best is yet to come. Off to Glenn for the financials."
320371,1679962671,2447457,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site",973,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site NOI growth, increased collections and lower credit loss. 
Our balance sheet metrics are also at the strongest levels ever. As you might expect, the completion of the $5.9 billion Weingarten merger, which closed in early August, was a key contributor. While we did not have a full quarter of contribution from the addition of the Weingarten portfolio, the benefits are clearly apparent. Our team has put in enormous effort to accomplish the successful integration of Weingarten in a very short period of time, many thanks to our highly motivated and skilled team. We couldn't be prouder. 
Now for some details on our third quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses. This compares to the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds. 
The increase in FFO was primarily driven by higher NOI of $98.7 million, of which the Weingarten merger contributed $62.6 million. In addition, NOI benefited from lower credit loss of $30.7 million and higher straight-line rent of $14.5 million, including $2 million from the Weingarten portfolio. Improvements in collections and new leases commencing during the quarter were the major contributors. Specifically, during the third quarter, we collected approximately 98% of base rents. 
We also collected 80% of rents due from cash basis tenants, up from 77% last quarter. Furthermore, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $8 million during the third quarter of 2021. Our cash basis tenants comprise 9.1% of pro-rata annualized base rents. If we excluded the addition of the Weingarten cash basis tenants, this amount would have been 7.3%, which compares favorably to the 8.8% level reported last quarter. 
 
In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Weingarten transaction, the debt we assumed was recorded at a fair value, which was $107 million higher than the face amount. This resulted in $6.2 million of fair market value amortization for the third quarter, which reduces interest expense and is also part of the FFO improvement. We expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by year-end. 
During the third quarter, FFO also included approximately $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to onetime contributions from several joint ventures and higher lease termination fees. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had an active quarter in the capital markets. We issued a new $500 million unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.25%, the lowest coupon for 10-year unsecured financing in the company's history. Proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and the merger costs. 
We also opportunistically used our ATM equity program to issue 3.5 million shares of common stock, raising almost $77 million in net proceeds to fund some of the investment activity Ross just mentioned. This is in addition to the 179.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Weingarten merger valued at $3.7 billion. We also assumed $1.8 billion of debt, including the fair value adjustment as part of the Weingarten merger. 
 
Total common shares outstanding at quarter end was 616.4 million, and we expect this should be a good guide for the fourth quarter. As anticipated, the Weingarten merger was a deleveraging event. As of September 30, net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of joint venture debt and preferred stock outstanding was 7x. This metric only includes 2 months of EBITDA from the Weingarten merger, but all of the debt assumed. On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of EBITDA from Weingarten, look-through net debt-to-EBITDA would be 6.3x, representing the lowest level since we began tracking this metric. 
 
Our liquidity position also remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $450 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, the value of our Albertsons marketable security investment climbed to more than $1.2 billion after increasing by $457 million, which is included in net income but not FFO for the quarter. We continue to evaluate our opportunities to begin the Albertsons' monetization process. 
As we look ahead, during 2022, we will have a variety of potential uses for the capital from the redemption of our preferred stock issuances that become callable, bonds that mature in October and November of 2022 and accretive investment opportunities. 
 
As our overall business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic and as we begin to benefit from the successful merger and integration of the Weingarten portfolio, we are raising our full year 2021 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, which includes $0.10 per diluted share of merger-related costs and the inclusion of the Weingarten portfolio for 5 months. 
This compares to previous NAREIT FFO per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.33, which did not include any impact from the Weingarten merger except $0.01 related to merger costs. As I touched upon, our third quarter FFO includes a total of $0.03 per share related to items that were more onetime in nature and which were not budgeted for as recurring items. This includes $0.02 per diluted share from improvements in credit loss and another $0.01 from contributions from joint ventures and lease termination fees. We will provide initial 2022 guidance on our next earnings call. 
 
And with that, we're happy to now take your questions."

This quarter, we had an outsized amount of small-shop volume that came through, which is typically closer to market.

That's our first priority as that really fuels the earnings growth. Then we have redevelopment opportunity as well. You've seen the entitlement work we've done throughout the portfolio. And the nice part is we're seeing a lot of external growth opportunities as well as Ross outlined. 
We do have some debt reduction opportunities, as Glenn outlined in his script. So yes, we're going to look at the menu and see what's really the most accretive towards our FFO growth because that's really where we're focused, and we have a lot of different levers to pull. So it's a nice, obviously, bucket of capital to redeploy. It's not earning a tremendous amount right now. So we're going to be prudent with it and recognize that we have a great menu to select from."

Because obviously, the price that you paid for Weingarten can't be replicated today. So just sort of curious how your underwriting deal is today given where pricing is going?"

So as it relates to the venture with Blackstone, I mean, these are clearly fixed assets that we felt very strongly about. Between the location, Publix being one of the best grocery anchors that you could possibly have with exceptional sales. As I mentioned in the script, having near-term mark-to-market opportunities in Publix-anchored centers is somewhat rare. So when you look at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with Publix. 
So we're really excited about that. We're really excited about sort of reengaging our venture with Blackstone after a very successful one several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise. We look at every single asset, every single space taking into consideration the growth in the market, the demographics, where the population growth is coming from and just making sure that we have very strong conviction in our ability to push rents. 
We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have outsized growth. So the ones that you do see us pulling the trigger on, you can -- rest assured that we believe very strongly that we're going to be able to push that outsized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So I don't think that there's anything specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or a portfolio. It's really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space and feel pretty good that there's below-market leases that we can push over time."

And I think where we are today is there's so much pent-up demand on the open-to-buy side for retailers. So you have some retailers that have really expanded the breadth of their offering in multiple brands that they're looking to expand. TJX being a great example and they actually increased their open-to-buy targets. So that just makes them more competitive for space. They want space they need to grow. 
I think COVID -- the silver lining through COVID is that brick-and-mortar is essential for any omnichannel strategy. Retailers have really come to appreciate that customers have appreciated that. It's a great form of distribution. The margins are better there. And then thirdly, obviously, there is no new development supply coming online. It's really COVID inventory that's getting absorbed. So to that third point, I think, generally speaking, as more of that gets absorbed, you're able to push rents further north. 
That said, to Conor's point earlier, we are seeing rent progressions in the Sunbelt and coastal markets. Southern California, for example, is becoming extremely competitive, where we are seeing some nice traction pushing that rent forward even beyond where we were pre-pandemic levels. But I'd say, generally speaking, you're in a very healthy environment from a landlord perspective as a result of all those variables."

So from the outset, we felt very good. We invested a tremendous amount of time upfront with the integration management office, kicking off 60 days prior to the merger.

Grocery is the obvious one. They're the clear beneficiary of the pandemic. They now have a surplus of cash that they're looking to reinvest in their 4 walls, expand their open-to-buy, grab market share and really invest towards the future, so how do they create better connectivity with the customers. So that's going to be really important for them as well as all the sectors. 
Off-price, as I mentioned earlier, with TJ, about Ross, Burlington, and others, Old Navy, they're all actively expanding their footprint. Again, they see -- I think all retailers see this opportunity where it's a short window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share in certain areas that pre-pandemic there was no inventory available. And so you do have this COVID inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them. 
But what I found that was actually interesting, this last quarter, when we go back to our small shop activity is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants and the fast casual side on the small shop side. So it's nice to see that the fast casual QSRs are coming back, the Crumbl Cookies of the world, et cetera. So you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID starts -- the COVID anxiety starts to subside, people want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize or are social creatures, that's creating that opportunity on the foodservice side. 
Fitness, the value-oriented fitness, Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on, several quarters ago that Planet and Crunch have been very proactive in wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. But you're also seeing that now extend out into the boutique fitness category. So that's again attracting the small shops. So you're really seeing it from a variety of areas. And then people are playing with formats. We have Bob's Discount who's experimenting with a smaller format right now. 
So it's giving them optionality appreciating that they may be able to provide different service offerings to different customers in different areas. And so it's important that they have a [ palette ] to play from."

And then I believe our normalized rate was about 170 basis points on spread. I don't think you see that for a period of time, but you are right. To your points about supply and openings, it's something that we watch very, very closely. We work hand-in-hand with our tenants. We have a very substantial tenant coordination program. which really is designed to shepherd tenants through the permitting and build-out process, those that don't have the resources available to them to address all of these issues that are coming out to the market. Obviously, that's been really helpful. 
In addition to that, we're trying to get well ahead on preordering of supplies and materials when we can, when it makes sense. We all lived through the backlog.

And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically, if there is a reason to bring in a new partner like we felt here on this particular transaction. 
But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able -- to be able to have that discussion with them hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be ready to take advantage of that if the partner is looking to exit. So one of the nice benefits that we see in the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just 3 major partners on the Kimco side there are now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term business with Kimco and we welcome that.  Others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the table or monetize their retail investments and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well. And we are having those conversations as we speak. 
So for us, given all the levers that we have, Conor mentioned and Glenn both mentioned in their prepared remarks, between the significant amount of cash, availability on our credit facility, ultimately, Albertsons monetization opportunity, we'll just be very prudent and selective with where we want to utilize that capital, but having a lot of different ways to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."

I think, again, on the retailer demand, it's a lot of the points that I mentioned earlier, Craig, but it's appreciating that the value of brick-and-mortar is real. Operators see it in their margins, consumers see the convenience and the efficiencies, the last-mile distribution. It goes into this very complex network of how to distribute goods from the retailer to the customer. 
And so I think COVID, the irony of COVID was it sort of validated that open air was really essential. It's closest to the customer. I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. It's -- we don't really know what that will look like long term. But I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there, too, which also then creates that opportunity to engage in open air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all of our portfolio resides. 
So we're seeing that benefit as well. And that could probably carry longer term into the market. So I think you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years sort of come to a head and now creating this environment that we're in today. 
So going forward, I think you continue to see the open to buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that COVID inventory. And then from there, I think the consumer is in a very strong position right now to take advantage of that."

I'd suggest we all buy early. We don't want to disappoint any of our loved ones during the holiday season. And what that means too, that means, as a result, that retailers can probably have fewer promotions. So there's a smaller promotional window, which helps drive top line revenues, which is a net benefit to them.

I mean I think the next couple of years could be somewhat reflective of today as well. So just thinking of geographics first because you mentioned that, the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases that we signed this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt markets. And then within that, the substantial majority were actually coastal some belt. So I think you will continue to see that trend progress over the next couple of years. That is where population growth is continuing to rise greater than the rest of the country. 
Second to that, though, on the coastal market, for that remaining, say, 48% of leases signed, it was heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. So I think you still see that high demand there. So between that, the coastal and Sunbelt, that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that, too, like Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to penetrate. So this COVID inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents further north. 
In the Northeast, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And so it's just there are natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well. And people wanting to penetrate Long Island, for example, I think will continue to be difficult. So when there is an opportunity, you do see multiple bidders at the table wanting to enter the market.

I think there's a few components that we have to look at when it comes to Albertsons because of the significant increase in its value. Keep in mind, our basis is incredibly low, right? Our basis today is still a little over $100 million. So the real governing factor for us is REIT compliance. So if you think about the REIT rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate-related items.  
 
So that leaves about -- you have a 5% bad income bucket and then you have the other 20% that could be interest and dividends and capital gains. So the governor is going to be how much our gross revenues are. And our gross revenues today on a look-forward basis with the merger are somewhere around $1.8 billion. So monetization-wise, about somewhere around $350 million to $400 million a year of gain is what we could absorb today. The larger the gross revenue number is the more we can do.

So you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio, both on buyouts and some potential select dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time or if we're better off recycling that capital selling from nonincome-producing assets and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities. 
So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's going to be a tremendous component of our capital stack."

I mean obviously, the last few quarters have been very strong with, on average, about 30 basis point gains between -- when you blend the 2 together.

So during the Great Recession, when we were going through the recovery period, we averaged about a 15 basis point gain when -- over an extended period of time to recover back to the occupancy that we lost. 
Now when you look at the pandemic and COVID, we ended up losing less about 270 basis points versus around 400 basis points in occupancy, though it's over a much shorter period of time. So you're starting to see that recovery cycle pick up a little bit sooner. And when I looked out, if we're ranging that 10 to 30 basis point occupancy gains quarter-over-quarter, that feels about right."

I think it's important to look at our redevelopment pipeline in 2 separate but complementary categories. The first is our core retail and repositioning effort.

That's where you're going to continue to see a lot of investment, and we're just in the process of integrating those opportunities and those projects into the combined Kimco portfolio. So that should start to be reflected in the coming quarters. 
And then the second part of that is obviously our Signature program. The one project we did activate earlier on was the Milton, the second tower at the Pentagon, where we had recently completed The Witmer, and that's the 250 residential unit project. And when we look at those projects going forward, we have a real menu of options. We have over 4,000 entitled residential units that we can draw upon now. Our goal is to obviously expand the entitled and the built population to over 10,000 -- 10,000 to 12,000 in the next 5 years. So we'll look at those selectively and determine at what point in time it makes sense to activate them and at what structure.

So they're looking for some additional square footage to do some inventory. You're also seeing others like some of the grocers that are actually repurposing some of their square footage within the 4 walls to utilize for last-mile fulfillment and micro fulfillment. And so they'll actually receive the goods from the loading dock and then split and distribute them into to do different categories, one goes to the floor to sell to the customers that walk into the store, while the balance goes to the micro fulfillment facility, which is actually within their existing 4 walls. 
And I think what you're seeing right now is all the retailers that have the means, experimenting with what works best for them. I can't say that I'm an expert on supply chain logistics and distribution, but I know it's extremely complex. And so it's really about, foundationally, how they're set up.

So if you think of the land values where we're located.

You've got to look at the, obviously, the FAR as well in terms of the build versus the parking lot. And that's, again, another barrier to entry in these dense areas. You just don't have the luxury of putting 80% of your property as a parking lot and not generating any revenues from that. And so we're watching it closely. We do think there's a good amount of slack still to be absorbed from the pandemic, and we're experiencing that throughout our portfolio. 
But to your point, if rents get to a point where they justify new development, it should start to happen. We haven't seen it yet, but those barriers to entry is why we've positioned our portfolio where it is because we don't want to be sitting in an asset that has tremendous amount of unbuilt dirt around it where you can have a competitor come quickly, out-position you.

Today, I will share the highlights of the quarter, provide a recap of our now closed strategic merger with Weingarten and give an update on the strong leasing environment. Ross will give an update on the transactio",663,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will share the highlights of the quarter, provide a recap of our now closed strategic merger with Weingarten and give an update on the strong leasing environment. Ross will give an update on the transaction market, and Glenn will cover our operating metrics in detail, discuss our improved balance sheet, Albertsons valuation and the proactive use of our ATM and how we can take advantage of opportunities in the market. He'll close with an updated outlook for the balance of the year. 
While we have only owned Weingarten for a partial quarter, our expanded portfolio of grocery-anchored and mixed-use properties is already validating our investment thesis. To date, we are exceeding our initial underwriting on all major metrics, including FFO, occupancy, spreads and renewal rates. As for synergies, as outlined in our earnings release, we have achieved the upper end of both ranges and anticipate achieving the full benefit of synergies by the end of 2022. 
Our dedicated team has done a remarkable job closing on the merger ahead of schedule and implementing an integration plan that included onboarding and training over 100 new employees, significant systems integration and property management, all while staying focused on executing our strategy. To all of my teammates, I just want to say thank you. 
On the operational front, leasing demand continues to be robust across the portfolio, with the bright spot being the rebound in demand for small shops. This was illustrated by the portfolio delivering another quarter of improved results, including a sequential increase in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Our pro-rata U.S. occupancy is up 20 basis points to 94.1%, while anchor occupancy remained flat at 96.9%. Small shop occupancy rose 180 basis points over prior quarter to 87.3%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. 
New lease spreads were a positive 5%, with 141 new leases signed, totaling 605,000 square feet. Spreads for renewals and options finished at positive 4.9%. We closed the quarter with 270 renewals and options totaling 1.4 million square feet, exceeding the 5-year average number of renewals and options reported during the third quarter by 40% and exceeded average GLA renewed by 38%. 
 
Combined spreads for third quarter 2021 were positive 4.9%, with total 3Q '21 deal volume reaching 411 deals totaling 2,050,321 square feet. 411 leases executed represents the most transactions reported during a quarter since the first quarter of 2018. 
 
Our same-site NOI growth was positive 12.1%, including a 30 basis point contribution from redevelopments. The same-site population does not include the Weingarten sites since we only had them for a partial quarter. With the continued strength in leasing, we have maintained our 300 basis point spread of leased versus economic occupancy similar to last quarter. 
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had over 400 signed leases representing $44.8 million of pro-rata annualized base rents awaiting rent commencement. While the operating environment remains favorable, we cannot let down our guard. Inflation, supply chain issues in the labor market, together or alone, can impact our business, and that is why we continue to look for the most resilient assets, improve operational efficiencies and seek out ways to help our tenants succeed. 
We continue to grow our portfolio in the high-growth Sunbelt markets and are committed to being the last-mile solution for tenants. There is no question that our mission-critical, last-mile brick-and-mortar locations are proving to be durable solutions for consumers, retailers and many other businesses that want scale and reach to serve the end customer. 
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we have made and believe that we have positioned Kimco for sustainable growth over the long term with a combination of internal and external growth levers. Our talented and deep team is focused on execution as we're in a unique position to take advantage of a wide range of opportunities. We continue to believe we're building something special, and the best is yet to come. Ross?"

We continue to see additional capital sources, new and old, gaining conviction in quality open-air retail, leading to the compression of cap rates. We are fortunate to be in a position with multiple investment strategies that enable us to be active when opportunities arise, but also patient when things become too frothy. 
With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities. 
 
Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in a portfolio of 6 Publix-anchored Sunbelt-region shopping centers from our existing joint venture partner, Jamestown, for a gross purchase price of $425.8 million. The Publix-anchored assets represent over 1.2 million square feet of gross leasable area in infill markets throughout the Southeast, with 5 located in the top-performing South Florida market and 1 in the high-growth Atlanta market. 
Subsequently, Kimco entered into a joint venture partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, under which we will both own 50% and Kimco will continue to manage the portfolio. It is rare to have the ability to buy a portfolio like this with short-term mark-to-market opportunities and exceptional tenant sales. We are thrilled to be partnering with Blackstone again on our new strategic venture.  
Also post quarter end and in line with our value creation strategy, we were successful in buying out our partner's 85% interest in 2 grocery-anchored centers in California. Anaheim Plaza is one of the jewels of our Southern California portfolio with extraordinary highway visibility in frontage and 2 grocery anchors at the same property, both performing exceptionally well. The second asset is Brookvale Shopping Center located in Fremont, California anchored by a Lucky's supermarket and CVS. The gross purchase price of the 2 assets was $134 million. 
 
Turning to our redevelopment program. It continues to move ahead, beginning with property-level entitlements and then selectively and creatively activating a few at a time. While the structure and exit strategy are determined on a case-by-case basis, we see the upside knowing these infill locations are being built at a significant relative spread to the stabilized cap rate. Comps in multifamily, industrial and other asset classes are regularly transacting with cap rates starting in the 2s and 3s. 
Additionally, we're continuing our structured investment program with a disciplined approach and an emphasis placed on location, demographics, quality of tenancy and operational strength of the sponsors. We view the base case of these investments as a true win-win, either generating an attractive return with a repayment down the road or exercising our right of first refusal and owning the properties outright. 
 
On that front, we completed a $21.5 million mezzanine financing on a strong performing center in San Antonio called Alamo Ranch. In just a few short months, San Antonio has gone from a market that was on our target list at Kimco to a major contributor in our portfolio with the Weingarten merger and now our second structured investment there. We continue to pursue additional opportunities in San Antonio, one of the fastest-growing MSAs in the country. 
We also sold 3 small low-growth assets this quarter, two single tenant boxes and an undeveloped parcel for a total of $23.5 million at a flat 5% cap. While dispositions will remain a relatively small component of our investment strategy, we will be prudent in disposing of low-growth assets and undeveloped parcels from which we can redeploy the capital. 
To repeat Conor's statement, we are confident that the best is yet to come. Off to Glenn for the financials."
320371,1679962671,2447467,"Kimco Realty Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Kimco Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site",973,"Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report very strong third quarter results. Overall, the portfolio continues to produce improving results, including record quarterly revenue, increased occupancy, positive leasing spreads, strong same-site NOI growth, increased collections and lower credit loss. 
Our balance sheet metrics are also at the strongest levels ever. As you might expect, the completion of the $5.9 billion Weingarten merger, which closed in early August, was a key contributor. While we did not have a full quarter of contribution from the addition of the Weingarten portfolio, the benefits are clearly apparent. Our team has put in enormous effort to accomplish the successful integration of Weingarten in a very short period of time, many thanks to our highly motivated and skilled team. We couldn't be prouder. 
Now for some details on our third quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses. This compares to the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds. 
The increase in FFO was primarily driven by higher NOI of $98.7 million, of which the Weingarten merger contributed $62.6 million. In addition, NOI benefited from lower credit loss of $30.7 million and higher straight-line rent of $14.5 million, including $2 million from the Weingarten portfolio. Improvements in collections and new leases commencing during the quarter were the major contributors. Specifically, during the third quarter, we collected approximately 98% of base rents. 
We also collected 80% of rents due from cash basis tenants, up from 77% last quarter. Furthermore, collections of prior period amounts from cash basis tenants totaled $8 million during the third quarter of 2021. Our cash basis tenants comprise 9.1% of pro-rata annualized base rents. If we excluded the addition of the Weingarten cash basis tenants, this amount would have been 7.3%, which compares favorably to the 8.8% level reported last quarter. 
 
In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation for the Weingarten transaction, the debt we assumed was recorded at a fair value, which was $107 million higher than the face amount. This resulted in $6.2 million of fair market value amortization for the third quarter, which reduces interest expense and is also part of the FFO improvement. We expect to finalize our purchase price allocation by year-end. 
During the third quarter, FFO also included approximately $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to onetime contributions from several joint ventures and higher lease termination fees. 
 
Turning to the balance sheet. We had an active quarter in the capital markets. We issued a new $500 million unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.25%, the lowest coupon for 10-year unsecured financing in the company's history. Proceeds from this issuance were primarily used to fund the cash component of the merger consideration and the merger costs. 
We also opportunistically used our ATM equity program to issue 3.5 million shares of common stock, raising almost $77 million in net proceeds to fund some of the investment activity Ross just mentioned. This is in addition to the 179.9 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the Weingarten merger valued at $3.7 billion. We also assumed $1.8 billion of debt, including the fair value adjustment as part of the Weingarten merger. 
 
Total common shares outstanding at quarter end was 616.4 million, and we expect this should be a good guide for the fourth quarter. As anticipated, the Weingarten merger was a deleveraging event. As of September 30, net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis, including pro-rata share of joint venture debt and preferred stock outstanding was 7x. This metric only includes 2 months of EBITDA from the Weingarten merger, but all of the debt assumed. On a pro forma basis, including a full quarter of EBITDA from Weingarten, look-through net debt-to-EBITDA would be 6.3x, representing the lowest level since we began tracking this metric. 
 
Our liquidity position also remains very strong. We ended the third quarter with over $450 million of cash and full availability on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, during the third quarter, the value of our Albertsons marketable security investment climbed to more than $1.2 billion after increasing by $457 million, which is included in net income but not FFO for the quarter. We continue to evaluate our opportunities to begin the Albertsons' monetization process. 
As we look ahead, during 2022, we will have a variety of potential uses for the capital from the redemption of our preferred stock issuances that become callable, bonds that mature in October and November of 2022 and accretive investment opportunities. 
 
As our overall business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic and as we begin to benefit from the successful merger and integration of the Weingarten portfolio, we are raising our full year 2021 NAREIT FFO per share guidance range to $1.36 to $1.37, which includes $0.10 per diluted share of merger-related costs and the inclusion of the Weingarten portfolio for 5 months. 
This compares to previous NAREIT FFO per share guidance of $1.29 to $1.33, which did not include any impact from the Weingarten merger except $0.01 related to merger costs. As I touched upon, our third quarter FFO includes a total of $0.03 per share related to items that were more onetime in nature and which were not budgeted for as recurring items. This includes $0.02 per diluted share from improvements in credit loss and another $0.01 from contributions from joint ventures and lease termination fees. We will provide initial 2022 guidance on our next earnings call. 
 
And with that, we're happy to now take your questions."

Some quarters, you could have significantly below market leases that roll and you execute and obviously, you'll get a real net benefit out of that. This quarter, we had an outsized amount of small-shop volume that came through, which is typically closer to market. So that's where you see that sub-5 range for this quarter, but it's not indicative necessarily what could happen next quarter if you have some outsized anchor activity that has a significant below market value that then you then can recapture.

We do have some debt reduction opportunities, as Glenn outlined in his script. So yes, we're going to look at the menu and see what's really the most accretive towards our FFO growth because that's really where we're focused, and we have a lot of different levers to pull.

So as it relates to the venture with Blackstone, I mean, these are clearly fixed assets that we felt very strongly about. Between the location, Publix being one of the best grocery anchors that you could possibly have with exceptional sales. As I mentioned in the script, having near-term mark-to-market opportunities in Publix-anchored centers is somewhat rare. So when you look at the vintage of those assets, it gives us an opportunity to create some additional growth probably sooner than some other opportunities that we have in the portfolio with Publix. 
So we're really excited about that. We're really excited about sort of reengaging our venture with Blackstone after a very successful one several years ago. Underwriting is still a very specific exercise. We look at every single asset, every single space taking into consideration the growth in the market, the demographics, where the population growth is coming from and just making sure that we have very strong conviction in our ability to push rents. 
We're not looking to invest in assets that don't have outsized growth. So the ones that you do see us pulling the trigger on, you can -- rest assured that we believe very strongly that we're going to be able to push that outsized growth beyond the average of our portfolio. So I don't think that there's anything specifically changing in terms of our underwriting strategy, whether it's a single asset or a portfolio. It's really just making sure that we look at every single asset, every single space and feel pretty good that there's below-market leases that we can push over time."

And I think where we are today is there's so much pent-up demand on the open-to-buy side for retailers. So you have some retailers that have really expanded the breadth of their offering in multiple brands that they're looking to expand. TJX being a great example and they actually increased their open-to-buy targets. So that just makes them more competitive for space. They want space they need to grow. 
I think COVID -- the silver lining through COVID is that brick-and-mortar is essential for any omnichannel strategy. Retailers have really come to appreciate that customers have appreciated that. It's a great form of distribution. The margins are better there. And then thirdly, obviously, there is no new development supply coming online. It's really COVID inventory that's getting absorbed. So to that third point, I think, generally speaking, as more of that gets absorbed, you're able to push rents further north. 
That said, to Conor's point earlier, we are seeing rent progressions in the Sunbelt and coastal markets. Southern California, for example, is becoming extremely competitive, where we are seeing some nice traction pushing that rent forward even beyond where we were pre-pandemic levels. But I'd say, generally speaking, you're in a very healthy environment from a landlord perspective as a result of all those variables."

Grocery is the obvious one. They're the clear beneficiary of the pandemic. They now have a surplus of cash that they're looking to reinvest in their 4 walls, expand their open-to-buy, grab market share and really invest towards the future, so how do they create better connectivity with the customers. So that's going to be really important for them as well as all the sectors. 
Off-price, as I mentioned earlier, with TJ, about Ross, Burlington, and others, Old Navy, they're all actively expanding their footprint. Again, they see -- I think all retailers see this opportunity where it's a short window to upgrade the quality of their portfolio, maybe penetrate a market or expand their market share in certain areas that pre-pandemic there was no inventory available. And so you do have this COVID inventory that's creating this unique opportunity for them. 
But what I found that was actually interesting, this last quarter, when we go back to our small shop activity is that 35% of our new deal activity was related to restaurants and the fast casual side on the small shop side. So it's nice to see that the fast casual QSRs are coming back, the Crumbl Cookies of the world, et cetera. So you're starting to see that expand out. And I think as COVID starts -- the COVID anxiety starts to subside, people want to go back and reengage. They want to socialize or are social creatures, that's creating that opportunity on the foodservice side. 
Fitness, the value-oriented fitness, Planet Fitness. I mentioned early on, several quarters ago that Planet and Crunch have been very proactive in wanting to expand their footprint and recapture. But you're also seeing that now extend out into the boutique fitness category. So that's again attracting the small shops. So you're really seeing it from a variety of areas. And then people are playing with formats. We have Bob's Discount who's experimenting with a smaller format right now. 
So it's giving them optionality appreciating that they may be able to provide different service offerings to different customers in different areas. And so it's important that they have a [ palette ] to play from."

And we've obviously gone through a very volatile evolution over the last 6 years about people's views and opinions and how the markets responded to different ideas related to e-commerce and whether or not what's essential. But let's go all the way back to core basics. People like to engage, they like to touch and feel product. Retailers need multiple forms of distribution to reach that customer. And so brick-and-mortar, we see it very much as being essential to them."

And I think what we could see is 300 basis points is more or less at our high water mark on a historic basis. And you could see some additional expansion as we approach the first part of '22. But as these tenants start to come online and open, you are going to start to see that compression set in through the back half of '22 and into '23. 
And then I believe our normalized rate was about 170 basis points on spread. I don't think you see that for a period of time, but you are right. To your points about supply and openings, it's something that we watch very, very closely. We work hand-in-hand with our tenants. We have a very substantial tenant coordination program. which really is designed to shepherd tenants through the permitting and build-out process, those that don't have the resources available to them to address all of these issues that are coming out to the market. Obviously, that's been really helpful. 
In addition to that, we're trying to get well ahead on preordering of supplies and materials when we can, when it makes sense. We all lived through the backlog. It doesn't matter who you are and no one's immune to it. So we're just eyes wide open about that process, and we'll manage it as best we can and apply the resources that we need to do to get it done."

But in general, it does afford us the opportunity to be out in front of those retail partners. 
They have a very aggressive open-to-buy strategy. We now have over 560 sites that we can show them to help accommodate and fill that void. So obviously, you can do that at scale, that's a good thing for both parties, but also helps us progress the conversation beyond that. Retailers are trying to figure out and innovate and change to become and stay more relevant to the customer. 
We want to work with them to be part of that solution and understand from a landlord perspective what do we need to do. So it creates a very, very constructive dialogue to help drive our business forward and to your point, revenue and top line growth."

And we've said, even as we've been sort of skinnying down our joint venture exposure over the last 7 or 8 years, on the Kimco side, we've had 3 very strong long-term partners that we continue to do business with. And as we've said from the start that we like having the ability to potentially grow opportunistically, if there is a reason to bring in a new partner like we felt here on this particular transaction. 
But for those that are potentially looking for a monetization event, we are willing and able -- to be able to have that discussion with them hopefully in a negotiated basis, if not having that right of first refusal to be ready to take advantage of that if the partner is looking to exit. So one of the nice benefits that we see in the Weingarten merger is after getting down to really just 3 major partners on the Kimco side there are now about 14 new joint venture partners from that transaction, some of which are looking to do long-term business with Kimco and we welcome that.  Others that are potentially looking to take some chips off the table or monetize their retail investments and we're also prepared to have those discussions as well. And we are having those conversations as we speak. 
So for us, given all the levers that we have, Conor mentioned and Glenn both mentioned in their prepared remarks, between the significant amount of cash, availability on our credit facility, ultimately, Albertsons monetization opportunity, we'll just be very prudent and selective with where we want to utilize that capital, but having a lot of different ways to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves."

I think, again, on the retailer demand, it's a lot of the points that I mentioned earlier, Craig, but it's appreciating that the value of brick-and-mortar is real. Operators see it in their margins, consumers see the convenience and the efficiencies, the last-mile distribution. It goes into this very complex network of how to distribute goods from the retailer to the customer. 
And so I think COVID, the irony of COVID was it sort of validated that open air was really essential. It's closest to the customer. I think you also now have this hybrid work environment. It's -- we don't really know what that will look like long term. But I think the one thing that's clear is going to be a little bit different for everyone. And as a result of that, you are having people that are staying more in that first-ring suburban markets that are maybe starting to appreciate the value proposition there, too, which also then creates that opportunity to engage in open air out in the first-ring suburbs where the majority of all of our portfolio resides. 
So we're seeing that benefit as well. And that could probably carry longer term into the market. So I think you're just starting to see all these pieces that were in flux and in development over multiple years sort of come to a head and now creating this environment that we're in today. 
So going forward, I think you continue to see the open to buys be aggressive as we start to absorb that COVID inventory. And then from there, I think the consumer is in a very strong position right now to take advantage of that."

I mean I think the next couple of years could be somewhat reflective of today as well. So just thinking of geographics first because you mentioned that, the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases that we signed this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt market",264,"Yes. I mean I think the next couple of years could be somewhat reflective of today as well. So just thinking of geographics first because you mentioned that, the Sunbelt, out of the 141 leases that we signed this quarter, over 52% came from Sunbelt markets. And then within that, the substantial majority were actually coastal some belt. So I think you will continue to see that trend progress over the next couple of years. That is where population growth is continuing to rise greater than the rest of the country. 
Second to that, though, on the coastal market, for that remaining, say, 48% of leases signed, it was heavily weighted towards the coastal markets. So I think you still see that high demand there. So between that, the coastal and Sunbelt, that's where we have seen the majority of activity. Beyond that, too, like Southern California, as I mentioned earlier, is extremely aggressive. It's a very, very tight market to penetrate. So this COVID inventory created opportunities, multiple demand factors that helped push rents further north. 
In the Northeast, it's typically been a fairly mature portfolio, usually having higher occupancy levels. And so it's just there are natural constraints there to actually add any new supply as well. And people wanting to penetrate Long Island, for example, I think will continue to be difficult. So when there is an opportunity, you do see multiple bidders at the table wanting to enter the market. And then -- so I think that's what you continue to see play out over the next couple of years."

I think when you look at the small shop gains that we had a 180 basis points, 120 of which came from the Weingarten portfolio, 60 of which came from Kimco gains, which was one of our high water marks as well quarter-over-quarter.

I think there's a few components that we have to look at when it comes to Albertsons because of the significant increase in its value. Keep in mind, our basis is incredibly low, right? Our basis today is still a little over $100 million. So the real governing factor for us is REIT compliance. So if you think about the REIT rules, 75% of your gross revenues have to come from real estate-related items.  
 
So that leaves about -- you have a 5% bad income bucket and then you have the other 20% that could be interest and dividends and capital gains. So the governor is going to be how much our gross revenues are. And our gross revenues today on a look-forward basis with the merger are somewhere around $1.8 billion. So monetization-wise, about somewhere around $350 million to $400 million a year of gain is what we could absorb today. The larger the gross revenue number is the more we can do.

So you may see a little bit more activity from the joint venture portfolio, both on buyouts and some potential select dispositions. Otherwise, part of what we inherited with the Weingarten portfolio as well as from the previous Kimco portfolio, is some undeveloped land parcels that we're constantly evaluating as to whether we believe they're prudent to be developed over time or if we're better off recycling that capital selling from nonincome-producing assets and then taking that capital for higher growth opportunities. 
So that's really where you're going to see the bulk of the disposition activity. But again, we don't think it's going to be a tremendous component of our capital stack."
