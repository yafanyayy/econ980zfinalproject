Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for our calendar year 2020. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott",778,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for our calendar year 2020. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2020 earnings of $3.79 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes. But first, I'm pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance from customer service to network reliability to earnings per share, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on efficiency, on financial discipline and an encouraging rebound in energy demand during the second half of the year resulted in the highest net income from operations and the highest earnings per share in company history. And throughout the difficulties of a pandemic year, we also accelerated our support for the communities we serve. In total, our companies and foundations donated more than $20 million to nonprofits across our service area, including more than $2 million to direct COVID-19 relief efforts. We also made significant progress on diversity and inclusion. We spent a record $303 million with diverse suppliers during the year, and through our Board refreshment, 46% of our Board members now are women or minorities. In addition, we set new aggressive goals as we continue to improve our environmental footprint. In fact, I'm pleased to report that based on preliminary data for 2020, we reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%, below 2005 levels, and we have, as you know, a well-defined plan to achieve a 55% reduction by the end of 2025. Over the longer term, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, and as we look out to the year 2050, the target for our generation fleet is net zero carbon. Our new 5-year capital plan lays out a road map for achieving these goals. We call it our ESG progress plan. The largest 5-year plan in our history. It calls for investment in efficiency, sustainability and growth, and it drives average annual growth in our asset base of 7% with no need for additional equity. Highlights of the plan include 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage that would be added to our regulated asset base in Wisconsin, and we've allocated an additional $1.8 billion to our infrastructure segment, where we see a robust pipeline of high-quality renewable projects, projects that have long-term contracts with strong creditworthy customers. All in all, our plan positions us to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. 
And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. It was, of course, an unusual year for everyone, but many of our commercial and industrial customers prove to be quite resilient, providing essential products and services, such as food, plastics, paper, packaging and electronic controls. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 5.5%. That's more than a full percentage point better than the national average. And as we look to the year ahead, we see positive signs of continued growth. For example, Green Bay packaging is building a major expansion of its mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. It's a $500 million addition and is expected to be completed later this year. The Foxconn, Komatsu mining, HARIBO and Milwaukee Tool projects that we've reported to you in the past are all moving forward as well. So we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth. Finally, I know many of you are interested in our rate case calendar for the year ahead. As you know, under normal circumstances, our Wisconsin Utilities would be filing rate reviews later this spring for energy rates that would go into effect on January 1, 2022. Of course, we're in the middle of anything but normal times, and I can tell you that we've begun discussions with the commission staff, and we'll be talking with other major stakeholders to determine whether a 1-year delay in a filing would be in everyone's best interest. I expect the final decision on this around the end of the first quarter. 
And now I'll be happy to turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results and our forecast for 2021 as well as an update on our infrastructure segment and our O&M performance. Scott, all yours."

Retail electric an",441,"Thank you, Gale. Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2020, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 27,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown beginning on Page 17 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 2.1% compared to 2019, and on a weather normal basis, deliveries were down 2.9%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin decreased 7.9% versus 2019 and by 2.4% on a weather normal basis. This excludes gas used for power generation. On the electric side, you'll note the positive trend that we have seen in residential sales has continued. Importantly, it has counterbalanced the weakness in small commercial and industrial sales caused by the pandemic. Meanwhile, large commercial industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 7.1% for the full year compared to 2019 on a weather normal basis. However, these sales were only down 4.6% for the fourth quarter, a notable positive trend, reflecting the recovery of Wisconsin's economy. 
Now I'd like to briefly touch on our 2021 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are using 2019 as a base for 2021 retail projections. We're using 2019 because it represents a more typical year. We are forecasting a decrease of 1.5% in weather normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine compared to 2019. This would represent a 1.4% increase compared to 2020. We expect large commercial and industrial sales to continue to improve and anticipate the same positive offsetting relationship between residential sales and small commercial industrial sales. For our natural gas business, we project weather normalized retail gas deliveries to decrease by 2.4% compared to 2019. This leads the projected sales outlook compared to 2020 relatively flat. With this in mind, we remain focused on operating efficiencies and financial discipline across our business. We lowered operations and maintenance costs by more than 3% in 2020, and we continue to adapt new technology and apply best practices. We plan to reduce our operations and maintenance expense by an additional 2% to 3% in 2021. I also have an update on our infrastructure segment. The Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge projects are in service now and came in ahead of time and on budget. As a reminder, our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service by the end of the third quarter. We expect this segment to contribute an incremental $0.08 to earnings in 2021. 
And now I'll turn it over to Kevin for his update on utility operations."

Throughout 2020, we kept the energy flowing to our customers safely and reliably. Our largest utility, We Energies, was named the most reliable electric company in the Midwest for the tenth year running, and our people's gas subsidiary was named the most trusted brand and a customer champion for the second year in a row by Escalent, a leading behavior and analytics firm. Now I'll review where we stand on current projects and our ESG progress plan. As you heard in our last call, the 2 Creek solar farm is now operating. As we've mentioned, this is a very large project. In fact, just days after achieving commercial operation this past November, our share of this project accounted for more than 20% of the solar output in the entire MISO generation market. Also in Wisconsin, We Energies is making progress in the approval process for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. If approved, we expect to be in construction in the fall of this year and to invest approximately $370 million in total to bring the facilities in operation in 2023. And as Gale just mentioned, our ESG progress plan includes 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage. Filings with the Wisconsin Commission for a number of these projects will begin in the first quarter. 
Turning to Illinois. As you may recall, we are in the midst of a rate review for one of our smaller subsidiaries, North Shore Gas, which serves approximately 160,000 customers in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Rates for North Shore Gas were lapped set more than 5 years ago before we acquired the company. Since then, we have consistently invested capital to serve our customers while reducing operating costs. The Illinois Commerce Commission has set a schedule for concluding the case. Greetings are expected to begin in late April with the final order in September. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend to [$0. 6775 ] a share for the first quarter of 2021. It's an increased focus of 7.1%. And the new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.71 a share, and this marks the 18th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Right smack dab in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. 
Next step, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financials and our first quarter guidance. Xia?"

Our 2020 earnings of $3.79 per share increased $0.21 per share compared to 2019. Our favorable 2020 results were driven by a number of factors: These included the execution of our capital plan, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities, RO",797,"Thanks, Gale. Our 2020 earnings of $3.79 per share increased $0.21 per share compared to 2019. Our favorable 2020 results were driven by a number of factors: These included the execution of our capital plan, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities, ROE improvement at American transmission company, production tax credit in our infrastructure business and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. These factors helped us to overcome the sales impact of COVID-19 and mild winter weather, and all of our utilities met their financial goals in 2020. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of 2020 results on Page 21. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.22 compared to 2019. First, O&M expenses were favorable. This includes $0.08 from lower day-to-day O&M expenses and $0.09 from lower sharing amounts in 2020 at our Wisconsin Utilities. Second, despite the impact of COVID-19 and reduced wholesale and other margins, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities continued capital investment and fuel drove a net $0.21 increase in earnings. Third, we had $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and an estimated $0.05 decrease in margins related to mild winter weather year-over-year. These factors partially offset the favorable items we discussed. Overall, we added $0.22 year-over-year from utility operations. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company increased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Recall that $0.07 of $0.08 were driven -- was due to ROE changes from FERC orders issued in November 2019 and May 2020, $0.04 resulted from the November 2019 order and $0.03 from the May 2020 order and $0.01 came mainly from continued capital investment. Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.05 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Coyote Ridge Wind Farm placed in service at the end of 2019. Additional 10% ownership of the upstream wind energy center and the Blooming Grove Wind Farm came online in early December. 
Finally, you'll observe that we recorded a $0.09 charge in Corporate and Other to account for the make-whole premiums we incurred in the fourth quarter as we refinance certain holding company debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. The remaining $0.05 decrease is related to some tax and other items, partially offset by lower interest expense. In summary, WEC improved on our 2019 performance by $0.21 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. Our effective income tax rate was 15.9% for 2020. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, our rate was 20.2%. Looking to 2021, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $149.5 million. Our increase in cash earnings in 2020 more than offset by higher working capital requirements, primarily related to COVID-19 and by higher pension contributions. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.9 billion in 2020, a $345 million increase from 2019. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and contracted renewable businesses at our Energy Infrastructure segment. In terms of financing activities, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we opportunistically refinanced over $1 billion of holding company debt, reducing the average interest rate of these notes from 3.3% to 1.5%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. As expected, our FFO to debt ratio was 15.4% in 2020. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contributions and customer arrays related to COVID-19, our FFO to debt was 16.9% in 2020. At the end of 2020, our ratio of holding company d1ebt to total debt was 28%, and below our 30% target. In addition, as Gale mentioned, we have no need for additional equity over the 5-year forecast period. 
Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2021. Last year, we earned $1.43 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2021 earnings to be in the range of $1.45 per share to $1.47 per share. We have taken into account mild weather to date, and this forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. For full year 2021, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $3.99 to $4.03 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

So long story short, the cadence will continue. It wouldn't surprise me if we have 1 or 2 more announcements during the calendar year 2021. And then regarding the change in the tax credits, the extension of the tax credits, really, all that does, I think, is give us even more to look at in the pipeline. It certainly does not in any way diminish our opportunity set. And remember that we're really utilizing our tax appetite here as a way to continue to grow earnings, continue to improve our environmental footprint and build optionality for down the road when we're certainly going to need in our retail rate base, a more carbon free energy."

How are you guys continuing to reduce costs as you think about this 2% to 3% after a year where so many of your peers already brought down cost, and the question is the sustainability of those cost reductions. So if you could elaborate on that? And then separately, just to follow-up on the last one, I'll throw it in there. You've already articulated some benefits on O&M. You've talked about your refinancing activities here that certainly have some tailwinds. What other pieces in this -- what other ingredients are there in terms of a stay out here that are relevant in these conversations, if you may?"

Well, first of all, related to the sustainability of O&M reductions, let me be very clear. We have continued runway, and I believe strong sustainability for continued O&M reductions, and let me give you 3 reasons why. I mean, the first is, we're pretty damn good at it, number one. Number two, we continue to benefit from from putting in common systems across our footprint. Remember, we had the acquisition of Entegris at the end of 2015. Since then, we have done an enormous amount of work to basically put everybody on the same platforms. We put in a new general ledger for every one of the companies. Just -- Kevin, just 10 days ago, 12 days ago, we completed a major conversion to a brand-new customer information and billing system where all 7 of our customer-facing utilities are now on that system. That is going to drive the optimization of our call centers, significant cost reduction. So number one, we are very, very good at financial discipline. Our operating folks are just terrific. Every single area of the company as a cost initiative for 2021 and beyond. And really, it's more than a cost initiative, it's an efficiency initiative. So I feel very good about basically our DNA in terms of continuing to drive efficiency and best practice across the enterprise, number one. Number two, just the continued ability to optimize the organization. We still have a runway to go there, post the acquisition of Entegris. And the example I gave you of a common customer information and billing system, I think, is a very good example of that. And then thirdly, we've announced, as you know, the retirement of a number of older, less efficient coal-fired power plants. There are significant O&M savings that will derive with the retirement of those plants, particularly over 2023, 2024 and 2025. The retirements are really going to come in that time frame, but there are millions of dollars of cost savings as we retire those plants going forward and replace that capacity with much more efficient technology. So that's a long answer to your question, but I hope it gives you some color on -- first of all, our success at continuing to drive efficiency, but also our -- the reason why we feel that that's sustainable and ongoing."

Well, first of all, I think if you asked anyone in our industry, you never say never, but that is one tall. I would kind of  elegizes it to a moonshot actually. When you think about what it would take, and again, the pace of technology development can change all of this. If you think about what it would practically take to get to a full carbon-free grid by 2035, you would frankly have to have the enormous technological change. If you think about what levers could you pull to get there, and they're probably four. One might be huge advancement in modular nuclear. One might be continuing advancement in the cost effectiveness of carbon capture. One might be a breakthrough in long duration battery storage. The other would be hydrogen. Again, when you look at where hydrogen is at in terms of bid stage of development, hard to think that, that could be widely available as a tool in 2035. Modular nuclear is a long way away being widely available. So that kind of leaves you with carbon capture. It also leaves you with, can there be some more significant advancement in battery technology for longer duration storage. I think those are the elements that we would continue to look at. If I were a betting man, I would say carbon capture is probably further along. But long story short, it's a tall order. And in the meantime, I think the good news is, our industry has done so much already. Our company has done so much already in emission reduction. We're -- our goals are mirror the goals in the Paris Climate Accord. So regardless of whether we're totally there in 2035, I think we can continue on the path of reducing emissions. We don't need any change in technology to hit our 2030 goal of a 70% reduction. So I'm still optimistic about the path of emission reductions, and we'll see about 2035. But I guess my bottom line message is, never say never, but it would take very significant technology evolution."

Short answer is no. In fact, I believe, in one of the states we serve, there is -- someone is drafting legislation to make sure there is never a ban on the use of natural gas, particularly for home heating. A couple of thoughts along those lines. And I'm happy to have Kevin, Xia, Scott, give you their view or add to anything that I might say. First of all, the region we serve, our 4 state area with natural gas. Well, let me give you an example. It's going to get according to the weather forecast. 32 below in international falls Minnesota this Sunday. There is not a heat pump in the world or one under development that could keep you warm at 32 below. So the market share for natural gas heating in each of the 4 states where we provide natural gas is huge. And on average -- in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, on average, it's almost a 70% market share. So natural gas for home heating has about a 70% market share. There is a reason for that. It's cost-effective. It's convenient. It's clean. And in these kind of climates, natural gas is really the best alternative. 
Now looking way down the road and some have said, well, maybe hydrogen will take the place of natural gas. Well, you still have to get the hydrogen from -- you still have to get the hydrogen to the customers. And as difficult as it would be as difficult as permitting it is as difficult as it is to build infrastructure in this country today, I can't imagine it's practical to develop an entirely new distribution network. And technologically, we believe, with some slight changes, natural gas distribution network could carry hydrogen fuel. So my sense is that the fear about the future of natural gas is a bit overblown, maybe way overblown. But in a climate like ours, the upper Midwest, natural gas is going to be an important product, I believe, for many years to come. And Scott, we're still seeing very strong customer growth on the natural gas delivery side of the business."

So there would be no need to address the coal plant retirements in any kind of a stay-out arrangement, if I'm making any sense to you. 
Secondly, if you think about what we have done, so we've retired a fair amount of capacity already. We've retired, I think, 65% of our coal-fired capacity since about 2015. And in essence, the unrecovered book balance of those plants has been fully recovered with the exception of $100 million of unrecovered book balance at Plaza Prairie, which is a large coal-fired power plant in Southeastern Wisconsin. That was our most recent retirement. That $100 million is being securitized, in fact, expect to be -- to have a securitization offering this year."

So my guess is that the overriding public policy will keep things stable or -- at least stable, if not positive at FERC."

Great question, Neil. Well, first of all, the current governor and the current gubernatorial administration here in Wisconsin has a very keen understanding that in order for the state to continue to make progress on CO2 reductions, there has to be a much stronger pickup in terms of electric vehicle penetration. I've heard that. I mean, I've had probably 3 discussions with the governor about this, and he really, really believes that's the case. So do I. So long story short, we have -- there are 2 things going on. First of all, we have filed a modest proposal for EV infrastructure that's pending before the Wisconsin Commission right now. And in addition to that, the Wisconsin Commission has opened up or is opening up a generic proceeding. What is it they should be broadly looking at to try to advance the governor's objective of an accelerated pickup in electric vehicle market share. So very early right now, but we do have a pilot that we've suggested that's getting regulatory review right now. And Scott, do you want to give just a couple of details on that filing?"

On the other hand, we were just talking about this the other day, actually. If we see an increase in the corporate income tax, which some have proposed, as you know, as part of the Biden plan, then we might have a stronger tax appetite. And if you couple that, meaning a stronger tax appetite, with the extension of these ITCs and PTCs, there may be a greater opportunity there.

First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2020 earnings of $3.79 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes. 
But first, I'm pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance from customer service to network reliability to earnings per share, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our focus on efficiency, on financial discipline and an encouraging rebound in energy demand during the second half of the year resulted in the highest net income from operations and the highest earnings per share in company history. And throughout the difficulties of a pandemic year, we also accelerated our support for the communities we serve. 
In total, our companies and foundations donated more than $20 million to nonprofits across our service area, including more than $2 million to direct COVID-19 relief efforts. 
We also made significant progress on diversity and inclusion. We spent a record $303 million with diverse suppliers during the year, and through our Board refreshment, 46% of our Board members now are women or minorities. In addition, we set new aggressive goals as we continue to improve our environmental footprint. 
In fact, I'm pleased to report that based on preliminary data for 2020, we reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%, below 2005 levels, and we have, as you know, a well-defined plan to achieve a 55% reduction by the end of 2025. 
Over the longer term, we expect to reduce carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, and as we look out to the year 2050, the target for our generation fleet is net zero carbon. 
Our new 5-year capital plan lays out a road map for achieving these goals. We call it our ESG progress plan. The largest 5-year plan in our history. It calls for investment in efficiency, sustainability and growth, and it drives average annual growth in our asset base of 7% with no need for additional equity. Highlights of the plan include 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage that would be added to our regulated asset base in Wisconsin. 
And we've allocated an additional $1.8 billion to our infrastructure segment, where we see a robust pipeline of high-quality renewable projects, projects that have long-term contracts with strong creditworthy customers. 
All in all, our plan positions us to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. 
And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. It was, of course, an unusual year for everyone, but many of our commercial and industrial customers prove to be quite resilient, providing essential products and services, such as food, plastics, paper, packaging and electronic controls. 
The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 5.5%. That's more than a full percentage point better than the national average. 
And as we look to the year ahead, we see positive signs of continued growth. For example, Green Bay packaging is building a major expansion of its mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. It's a $500 million addition and is expected to be completed later this year. The Foxconn, Komatsu mining, HARIBO and Milwaukee Tool projects that we've reported to you in the past are all moving forward as well. 
So we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth. 
Finally, I know many of you are interested in our rate case calendar for the year ahead. As you know, under normal circumstances, our Wisconsin Utilities would be filing rate reviews later this spring for energy rates that would go into effect on January 1, 2022. Of course, we're in the middle of anything but normal times, and I can tell you that we've begun discussions with the commission staff, and we'll be talking with other major stakeholders to determine whether a 1-year delay in a filing would be in everyone's best interest. I expect the final decision on this around the end of the first quarter. 
And now I'll be happy to turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results and our forecast for 2021 as well as an update on our infrastructure segment and our O&M performance. Scott, all yours."

At the end of 2020, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 27,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. 
Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown beginning on Page 17 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 2.1% compared to 2019, and on a weather normal basis, deliveries were down 2.9%. 
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin decreased 7.9% versus 2019 and by 2.4% on a weather normal basis. This excludes gas used for power generation. On the electric side, you'll note the positive trend that we have seen in residential sales has continued. Importantly, it has counterbalanced the weakness in small commercial and industrial sales caused by the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, large commercial industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 7.1% for the full year compared to 2019 on a weather normal basis. However, these sales were only down 4.6% for the fourth quarter, a notable positive trend, reflecting the recovery of Wisconsin's economy. 
Now I'd like to briefly touch on our 2021 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are using 2019 as a base for 2021 retail projections. We're using 2019 because it represents a more typical year. We are forecasting a decrease of 1.5% in weather normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine compared to 2019. 
This would represent a 1.4% increase compared to 2020. We expect large commercial and industrial sales to continue to improve and anticipate the same positive offsetting relationship between residential sales and small commercial industrial sales. 
For our natural gas business, we project weather normalized retail gas deliveries to decrease by 2.4% compared to 2019. This leads the projected sales outlook compared to 2020 relatively flat. 
With this in mind, we remain focused on operating efficiencies and financial discipline across our business. We lowered operations and maintenance costs by more than 3% in 2020, and we continue to adapt new technology and apply best practices. We plan to reduce our operations and maintenance expense by an additional 2% to 3% in 2021. 
I also have an update on our infrastructure segment. The Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge projects are in service now and came in ahead of time and on budget. As a reminder, our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service by the end of the third quarter. We expect this segment to contribute an incremental $0.08 to earnings in 2021. 
And now I'll turn it over to Kevin for his update on utility operations."

Our largest utility, We Energies, was named the most reliable electric company in the Midwest for the tenth year running, and our Peoples Gas subsidiary was named the most trusted brand and a customer champion for the second year in a row by Escalent, a leading behavior and analytics firm. Now I'll review where we stand on current projects and our ESG progress plan. As you heard in our last call, the 2 Creek solar farm is now operating. As we've mentioned, this is a very large project. 
In fact, just days after achieving commercial operation this past November, our share of this project accounted for more than 20% of the solar output in the entire MISO generation market. 
Also in Wisconsin, We Energies is making progress in the approval process for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. If approved, we expect to be in construction in the fall of this year and to invest approximately $370 million in total to bring the facilities in operation in 2023. 
And as Gale just mentioned, our ESG progress plan includes 1,800 megawatts of wind, solar and battery storage. Filings with the Wisconsin Commission for a number of these projects will begin in the first quarter. 
Turning to Illinois. As you may recall, we are in the midst of a rate review for one of our smaller subsidiaries, North Shore Gas, which serves approximately 160,000 customers in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Rates for North Shore Gas were lapped set more than 5 years ago before we acquired the company. Since then, we have consistently invested capital to serve our customers while reducing operating costs. The Illinois Commerce Commission has set a schedule for concluding the case. Greetings are expected to begin in late April with the final order in September. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Our 2020 earnings of $3.79 per share increased $0.21 per share compared to 2019. Our favorable 2020 results were driven by a number of factors: These included the execution of our capital plan, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities, RO",797,"Thanks, Gale. Our 2020 earnings of $3.79 per share increased $0.21 per share compared to 2019. Our favorable 2020 results were driven by a number of factors: These included the execution of our capital plan, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities, ROE improvement at American transmission company, production tax credit in our infrastructure business and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. 
These factors helped us to overcome the sales impact of COVID-19 and mild winter weather, and all of our utilities met their financial goals in 2020. 
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of 2020 results on Page 21. I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. 
Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.22 compared to 2019. First, O&M expenses were favorable. This includes $0.08 from lower day-to-day O&M expenses and $0.09 from lower sharing amounts in 2020 at our Wisconsin Utilities. Second, despite the impact of COVID-19 and reduced wholesale and other margins, rate adjustments at our Wisconsin Utilities continued capital investment and fuel drove a net $0.21 increase in earnings. Third, we had $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and an estimated $0.05 decrease in margins related to mild winter weather year-over-year. These factors partially offset the favorable items we discussed. 
Overall, we added $0.22 year-over-year from utility operations. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company increased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Recall that $0.07 of $0.08 were driven -- was due to ROE changes from FERC orders issued in November 2019 and May 2020, $0.04 resulted from the November 2019 order and $0.03 from the May 2020 order and $0.01 came mainly from continued capital investment. 
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.05 in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Coyote Ridge Wind Farm placed in service at the end of 2019. Additional 10% ownership of the upstream wind energy center and the Blooming Grove Wind Farm came online in early December.
Finally, you'll observe that we recorded a $0.09 charge in Corporate and Other to account for the make-whole premiums we incurred in the fourth quarter as we refinance certain holding company debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. The remaining $0.05 decrease is related to some tax and other items, partially offset by lower interest expense. In summary, WEC improved on our 2019 performance by $0.21 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. Our effective income tax rate was 15.9% for 2020. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, our rate was 20.2%. 
Looking to 2021, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. 
As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $149.5 million. Our increase in cash earnings in 2020 more than offset by higher working capital requirements, primarily related to COVID-19 and by higher pension contributions. 
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.9 billion in 2020, a $345 million increase from 2019. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and contracted renewable businesses at our Energy Infrastructure segment. 
In terms of financing activities, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we opportunistically refinanced over $1 billion of holding company debt, reducing the average interest rate of these notes from 3.3% to 1.5%. 
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. As expected, our FFO to debt ratio was 15.4% in 2020. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contributions and customer arrays related to COVID-19, our FFO to debt was 16.9% in 2020. 
At the end of 2020, our ratio of holding company debt to total debt was 28%, and below our 30% target. In addition, as Gale mentioned, we have no need for additional equity over the 5-year forecast period. 
Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2021. Last year, we earned $1.43 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2021 earnings to be in the range of $1.45 per share to $1.47 per share. We have taken into account mild weather to date, and this forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. For full year 2021, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $3.99 to $4.03 per share.
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

As I mentioned in our -- in the prepared remarks that we're going through due diligence on a number of projects right now. We've got a robust pipeline that we're looking at. And because we're so far ahead of schedule on our infrastructure segment right now, we can afford to be very selective and really cherry-pick only the very best projects that meet or exceed our criteria. 
So long story short, the cadence will continue. It wouldn't surprise me if we have 1 or 2 more announcements during the calendar year 2021. And then regarding the change in the tax credits, the extension of the tax credits. Really, all that does, I think, is give us even more to look at in the pipeline. It certainly does not in any way diminish our opportunity set. 
And remember that we're really utilizing our tax appetite here as a way to continue to grow earnings, continue to improve our environmental footprint and build optionality for down the road when we're certainly going to need in our retail rate base, a more carbon free energy."

We have continued runway, and I believe strong sustainability for continued O&M reductions. And let me give you 3 reasons why. I mean, the first is, we're pretty damn good at it, number one. Number two, we continue to benefit from from putting in common systems across our footprint. Remember, we had the acquisition of Integrys at the end of 2015. Since then, we have done an enormous amount of work to basically put everybody on the same platforms. 
We put in a new general ledger for every one of the companies. Just -- Kevin, just 10 days ago, 12 days ago. We completed a major conversion to a brand-new customer information and billing system where all 7 of our customer-facing utilities are now on that system. That is going to drive the optimization of our call centers, significant cost reduction. So number one, we are very, very good at financial discipline. 
Our operating folks are just terrific. Every single area of the company as a cost initiative for 2021 and beyond. And really, it's more than a cost initiative, it's an efficiency initiative. 
So I feel very good about basically our DNA in terms of continuing to drive efficiency and best practice across the enterprise, number one. Number two, just the continued ability to optimize the organization. We still have a runway to go there, post the acquisition of Integrys. And the example I gave you of a common customer information and billing system, I think, is a very good example of that. And then thirdly, we've announced, as you know, the retirement of a number of older, less efficient coal-fired power plants. There are significant O&M savings that will derive with the retirement of those plants, particularly over 2023, 2024 and 2025. The retirements are really going to come in that time frame, but there are millions of dollars of cost savings as we retire those plants going forward and replace that capacity with much more efficient technology. 
So that's a long answer to your question, but I hope it gives you some color on -- first of all, our success at continuing to drive efficiency, but also our -- the reason why we feel that that's sustainable and ongoing."

Well, first of all, I think if you asked anyone in our industry, you never say never, but that is one tall -- I would kind of elegizes it to a moonshot actually. When you think about what it would take, and again, the pace of technology development can change all of this. 
If you think about what it would practically take to get to a full carbon-free grid by 2035, you would frankly have to have the enormous technological change. If you think about what levers could you pull to get there, and they're probably four. One might be huge advancement in modular nuclear. One might be continuing advancement in the cost effectiveness of carbon capture. One might be a breakthrough in long duration battery storage. The other would be hydrogen. 
Again, when you look at where hydrogen is at in terms of bid stage of development, hard to think that, that could be widely available as a tool in 2035. Modular nuclear is a long way away being widely available. So that kind of leaves you with carbon capture. It also leaves you with, can there be some more significant advancement in battery technology for longer duration storage. I think those are the elements that we would continue to look at. If I were a betting man, I would say carbon capture is probably further along. But long story short, it's a tall order. And in the meantime, I think the good news is, our industry has done so much already. Our company has done so much already in emission reduction. 
We're -- our goals are mirror the goals in the Paris Climate Accord. So regardless of whether we're totally there in 2035, I think we can continue on the path of reducing emissions. We don't need any change in technology to hit our 2030 goal of a 70% reduction. So I'm still optimistic about the path of emission reductions, and we'll see about 2035. But I guess my bottom line message is, never say never, but it would take very significant technology evolution."

Short answer is no. In fact, I believe, in one of the states we serve, there is -- someone is drafting legislation to make sure there is never a ban on the use of natural gas, particularly for home heating. 
A couple of thoughts along those lines. And I'm happy to have Kevin, Xia, Scott, give you their view or add to anything that I might say. First of all, the region we serve, our 4 state area with natural gas. Well, let me give you an example. It's going to get according to the weather forecast. 32 below in international falls Minnesota this Sunday. There is not a heat pump in the world or one under development that could keep you warm at 32 below. So the market share for natural gas heating in each of the 4 states where we provide natural gas is huge. And on average -- in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, on average, it's almost a 70% market share. So natural gas for home heating has about a 70% market share. There is a reason for that. It's cost-effective. It's convenient. It's clean. And in these kind of climates, natural gas is really the best alternative. 
Now looking way down the road and some have said, well, maybe hydrogen will take the place of natural gas. Well, you still have to get the hydrogen from -- you still have to get the hydrogen to the customers. And as difficult as it would be as difficult as permitting it is as difficult as it is to build infrastructure in this country today, I can't imagine it's practical to develop an entirely new distribution network. 
And technologically, we believe, with some slight changes, natural gas distribution network could carry hydrogen fuel. So my sense is that the fear about the future of natural gas is a bit overblown, maybe way overblown. But in a climate like ours, the upper Midwest, natural gas is going to be an important product, I believe, for many years to come. And Scott, we're still seeing very strong customer growth on the natural gas delivery side of the business."

So again, we're talking about 2023, 2024 for the majority of the retirements that we're talking about, including the one of Columbia that was just announced by Alliant. So there would be no need to address the coal plant retirements in any kind of a stay-out arrangement, if I'm making any sense to you. 
Secondly, if you think about what we have done, so we've retired a fair amount of capacity already. We've retired, I think, 65% of our coal-fired capacity since about 2015. And in essence, the unrecovered book balance of those plants has been fully recovered with the exception of $100 million of unrecovered book balance at Plaza Prairie, which is a large coal-fired power plant in Southeastern Wisconsin. That was our most recent retirement. That $100 million is being securitized, in fact, expect to be -- to have a securitization offering this year."

I'm guessing, we'll fully understand that you're not going to reach the administration's goals for renewable development without further incentivizing transmission development. Those 2 go hand-in-hand, chicken and egg. I mean, it's got to be done.

So my guess is that the overriding public policy will keep things stable or -- at least stable, if not positive at FERC."

We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $1.61 a share. As always, our focus on operating excellence was a major factor in our performance. In addition, we saw the positive impact of colder weather and economic recovery in our region. Xia will provide you with more details on our metrics in just a few minutes. 
But first, a comment about the polar vortex event that experienced in February. Our people and our infrastructure were put to the test literally and performed remarkably during that bitter cold stretch when temperatures dropped to minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. I'm pleased to report that the investments we've made in our energy grid and our diverse fuel mix kept the economy moving and our customers safe and warm. Now as you know, just over a year has passed since we first saw the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commitment to safety, efficiency and reliability has only been enhanced by the operational challenges we faced. Our company today stands stronger than ever. And our $16.1 billion capital plan, the largest in company history, is on track. 
Over the next 5 years, we expect our investment plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it will bolster our sustainability as we continue to invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art infrastructure. In fact, the potential we see in renewables and battery storage, the progress we made across our system already and supportive public policy have allowed us to step back and reassess our future environmental goals. So today, I'm pleased to announce that we're setting even more aggressive targets for the next several years. Our goal is now a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; some operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we continue to execute our capital plan. And of course, our long-term goal remains net 0 carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. 
In addition, on the natural gas distribution side of our business, we're now targeting net 0 methane emissions by the end of 2030. Our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and incorporate renewable natural gas into our system will clearly help us achieve this 2030 milestone. You'll be able to read more about these goals and our updated climate report. We'll be launching that report on our website tomorrow morning. 
As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're making really good headway on our capital plan. We call it our ESG progress plan. Since our last visit with you, we've announced 4 renewable projects for our regulated business in Wisconsin, and another wind project, the J Hawk wind farm at our WEC infrastructure segment. Scott and Kevin are on tap to fill you in on the details. But I will add 2 important points about the impact of our ESG progress plan. As we continue to reshape our asset mix, we project that less than 10% of our revenues and less than 10% of our assets will be tied to coal by the end of 2025. And we would more than triple our investment in renewables across our enterprise. You put it all together, we expect to deliver among the best risk-adjusted returns the industry has to offer. We have strong credit quality and no need to issue equity. At the heart of it all is our ability to deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy that our customers depend on. 
Now switching gears for a moment. Let's take a quick look at the regional economy. With the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccinations well underway, we're seeing more signs of economic recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands today at 3.8%. That's close to pre-pandemic levels and more than 1 percentage point better than the national average. In addition, our recent business survey by the University of Wisconsin confirmed that all core indicators of productivity to income are looking up. Also, you may have seen the announcement last week that Foxconn has reached a new agreement with the state of Wisconsin regarding Foxconn's high-tech campus South of Milwaukee. The agreement provides for up to $80 million of performance-based incentives if Foxconn hires 1,454 qualified workers and invest $672 million by 2026. It also importantly gives Foxconn the flexibility to be responsive to the marketplace. This time, the Foxconn campus is expected to focus on producing computer servers and server parts. That's one of Foxconn specialties. In fact, we understand that Foxconn supplies approximately 40% of the worldwide market for servers. Foxconn also noted that over time, it plans to make the Wisconsin site, one of the largest, if not the largest manufacturer of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So as business opportunities continue to arise, Foxconn will work with the state on contract changes that would incorporate additional jobs and more new investment beyond this agreement. 
As we look further across our service area, we see numerous green shoots of growth. For example, Green Bay Packaging just completed a $500 million expansion of its paper mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. Amazon continues to expand. The company just announced another fulfillment center. This one will be located in one of our western suburbs. And Uline is growing again, building 2 new distribution warehouses in the Kenosha area south of Milwaukee, with a projected investment of $130 million. If you're not familiar with the name, Uline is one of the nation's leading distributors of shipping, industrial and packaging materials. So with all the developments we're seeing in the ground, we remain optimistic about the growth of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 7,000 more electric customers and 25,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 10 of the earnings packet. In Wisconsin, we saw sales growth on a weather normal basis across our entire retail business compared to the first quarter of 2020. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.2%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased by 0.5 of 1%. Retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 1.1% from the first quarter of 2020, and on a weather normal basis, were up 1.4%. Overall, our growth is tracking ahead of our forecast as the economy begins to open up. As we once in March, we are adding another project to our infrastructure segment. We acquired a 90% ownership interest in the Jayhawk wind farm. This project will be built in Kansas and consists of 70 wind turbines with a combined capacity of more than 190 megawatts. Jayhawk is expected to go in service by the end of this year. This project fits our investment criteria well. It is a long-term offtake agreement with Facebook for all the energy produced. We plan to invest $302 million for the 90% ownership interest and substantially all the tax benefits. 
As a reminder, our Thunderhead wind investment is now projected to go in service by year-end. We now have 7 wind projects announced or in operations in our infrastructure segment. This represents $1.9 billion of investment with a strong pipeline of opportunities ahead, we expect to invest an additional $1.5 billion in this segment through 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

We continue to realize efficiencies across our system of companies and we'll apply the lessons learned as we design workforce practices post-pandemic. 
Now let me touch on some recent developments in our ESG progress plan. Since our last call, we announced 4 large-scale renewable projects for our Wisconsin Utilities. The Paris, Darian and Koskan Solar Battery Park as well as the Red Barn Wind Park. In total, our shares of these projects would provide 675 megawatts of solar generation, 316 megawatts of battery storage and 82 megawatts of wind. Upon the commission's approval, we will invest approximately $1.5 billion to bring them online between 2022 and 2024. We expect these projects to deliver significant operating cost savings and maintain reliability. These projects, of course, are all part of our plans to invest significant capital dollars in renewables and battery storage for utilities between 2021 and 2025. More to come in the next few months. We are also proposing to build 128 megawatts of generation at our existing Westing power plant site in Northwest Wisconsin. The new facility will use 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them, units. If approved, we expect to invest $170 million in this project for a targeted in-service date in 2023. 
On the natural gas distribution side, We Energies is making its way through the approval process for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. Pending approvals, which we anticipate by the end of this year, we would expect to bring the facilities in operation late in 2023. 
Now for a few regulatory updates. On March 30, we filed a request for the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to forego a rate case filing this year after we reached an agreement with the MA customer and environmental groups. We look forward to the commission's decision in 60 to 90 days. At this time, we're in the midst of rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. North Shore Gas and Michigan Gas Utilities. These proceedings are to support important investments in our distribution infrastructure. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Our 2021 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020.

Our 2021 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our favorable results for the first quarter of 2021 were driven by a number of factors. These included the continued execution of our capital plan, colder winter weather conditions, stronger weather-normalized sales, increased production tax credits, lower interest expense and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 14. 
I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2020. First, colder winter weather conditions when compared to the first quarter of last year, drove a $0.05 increase in earnings. Also, rate adjustments and weather-normalized sales added $0.05 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Negative drivers included $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.02 increase in day-to-day O&M expense. The increase in O&M expense was more than offset by the favorable performance of our rabbi trust performance. Rabbi trust investments included in the corporate and other segments. Overall, we added $0.04 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. 
Moving on to our investment in American transmission company. We picked up $0.01 related to continued capital investment. Recall that our investment is now earning a return on equity of 10.52%. We are aware of the recent proposal to remove incentive ROE adders for RTO membership. The past, ATC would lose a 50 basis point ROE adder. On an annualized basis, it would be a $0.02 earnings drag for WEC. Of course, we're watching this development closely. 
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Blooming wind farm placed in service in December 2020 and the Tatanka Ridge wind farm, which came online in early January. 
Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segment increased $0.11, driven by improved rabbi trust investment performance, some favorable tax items resolved in the quarter and lower interest expense. 
In summary, we improved on our first quarter 2020 performance by $0.18 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate would be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Despite in natural gas costs seen throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with customer arrears, contributed to this increase in working capital. However, with normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to improve throughout the remainder of the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $590 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $94 million increase from 2020. 
On the financing front, with the $600 million holdco issuance in March, along with our refinancing efforts last year, the average interest rate on our holdco senior notes is now 1.8% compared to 3.5% a year ago. This will continue to provide a favorable interest variance throughout the year. 
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. For the quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.75 to $0.77 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.76 per share in the second quarter last year. Excluding $0.03 of better-than-normal weather and a $0.03 pickup from a FERC ROE decision, we would have earned $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Gale mentioned earlier, we're guiding to the top end of our range for the full year. And as a reminder, that range is $3.99 per share to $4.03 per share. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Coupled with the fact that not only is the time running out in terms of the length of the legislative session, but also understanding is legislature has to deal with a budget for Illinois, which has been historically contentious and redistricting. So there is a lot on their plate. And we'll see what happens, but the number of competing bills, lots of discussion going on, we'll see if anything really does take place. But I would remind everyone that the focus remains very much on the electric side of the business there, which we're not involved with. On potential subsidies for Exelon's nuclear plants. So there are lots of things going on there. I suspect that the  rider, for example, that we have at Peoples Gas is not necessarily the major focus of what's going on right now. We'll see. But again, even if that rider were to be repealed, and I don't really think it will, then we would revert all of the utilities would simply revert to normal rate cases with forward-looking test periods. So time will tell, but we're not overly concerned at the moment in terms of the future of what needs to be done in Illinois."

So we talked about the revised agreement with the state. Importantly, that agreement with the state runs through basically 2026. The earlier, the first agreement that Foxconn had with the state was a much longer-term agreement. So it would be a mistake to think that what's on the table now, where Foxconn has clear line of visibility on what they will produce at the campus. It's a mistake to think that, that's all there is. In fact, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Foxconn is still saying that their aspirational goal is to make this campus one of the largest producers of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So the door is wide open for future projects beyond this period. And again, the first agreement the state had with Foxconn ran more than 10 years. This agreement is shorter-term and deliberately so, but does not preclude additional long-term investment. In fact, the door is open for additional long-term investment at that campus.

I think our overall view probably can be summarized in maybe 3 points. The first is way too early to tell. As you can imagine -- you can imagine the sausage making and the concessions and the changes that are going to take place over the course of, I think, an extended period of debate, particularly to craft something that could get through the Senate. So I think overall, again, probably way too early to tell. However, there are a couple of things that seem to have very strong consensus. The first, I think, would be very beneficial, not only to our industry, but to our company in specific, and that's the extension of the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, the application of tax credits to battery storage and the additional drive toward continuing to incentivize renewables. That obviously will be extremely helpful going forward. And I suspect, just based on everything we're seeing and hearing and as we talk to folks in Washington, I think those particular items have very strong consensus and support. In addition to that, I don't know if there's any question that if all of these tax credits continue to be extended and applied across the board as we expect they will be, there will continue to be more renewable development, which is helpful to us, particularly in terms of our infrastructure segment and actually our regulated segment as well, but also a continued drive toward expansion of transmission. And as you may have seen, and Kevin has got some very specific statistics, MISO has made a very interesting projection for the next 20 years on how much additional investment just in the mid -- the MISO footprint that they project for additional transmission that would support renewables.

So I'm not sure that comparing the cycles is necessarily the right thing to do because I think the motivations for the M&A were different. Having said all of that, longer term, I still believe we're in a consolidating industry. I still believe that scale matters. The good news is we have significant scale and continuing efficiency opportunities. But I think over time, you'll probably see a different form of M&A, at least in my opinion than what you saw over the last 5 or 6 years. I think less in terms of premiums, and more in terms of mergers of equal-type opportunities. Scale still does matter. Growth still does matter. Efficiency still does matter. So we've clearly seen a lull, as you probably would expect, going through a pandemic. I don't think there's going to be a giant uptick immediately in M&A in our industry. But over time, I do believe it's still a consolidating industry. But I would suspect that the criteria be much closer to the ones that we use. And I can just briefly repeat those again, if you'd like, and that is, we'd have to be convinced after significant due diligence that an acquisition would be additive or accretive to earnings per share in the first full year after closing. The second is we've worked very hard to have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry, and we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it. And the third is really important as well, and that is that you'd have to really believe that the growth rate of anything that we would acquire would be at least as strong as our own organic growth rate. So read that at least 5% to 7% a year. Hope that answers your question, Michael."

And just to be clear, again, I think you're raising an important point. By the end of 2025, we would expect our revenues and our asset base tied to coal will be both be less than 10%. And the reason we wanted to mention that is I think there's perhaps been a perception among some investors that we still have a very large portion of our asset-based type but simply as we reshape our energy and our asset mix, that's simply not the case, number one. The other thing that I think is really an important point here is that we can achieve not only the 2025 goal, but also the very aggressive 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by the end of 2030 with existing technology, some operating refinements and some retirements. And so that, I think, gives you a sense of how dynamic our reshaping of our asset mix is and how small the reliance will continue to be, obviously, less than 10% by 2025 and we think lower than that by 2030."

I guess if I could flip that question around though and thinking how strong maybe your fossil infrastructure performed, does that give the regulators any pause on approving the company's ESG platform? If we think about some are blaming what happened in Texas and maybe fault of some of the renewable projects that were going there? And given how strong your total infrastructure worked this past winter, does that maybe cause any pause on build-out of renewables?"

And I think the honest answer is we have an intelligent and very well informed State Public Service Commission here.  They recognize that basically for -- to give you a very specific example, during the polar vortex event in February, we had to have everything running to keep the lights out of the gas flowing, everything. The coal units, the nuclear units, the wind farms, the solar. Everything had to be operating given the demands that we saw. So to the contrary, I think the diversity of our fuel mix  and the way it performed and needed to perform for public safety, I think, underscores the fact that we have to have a diverse fuel mix going forward. And clearly, we think we can maintain not only I think we know we can maintain reliability by adding this amount of renewables, but it's possible because we have such efficient, strong, dispatchable fossil units. So put that all together, and we can still achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions. So I hope that responds to your question, Anthony."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CE",1080,"Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $1.61 a share. As always, our focus on operating excellence was a major factor in our performance. In addition, we saw the positive impact of colder weather and economic recovery in our region. Xia will provide you with more details on our metrics in just a few minutes. 
But first, a comment about the polar vortex event that experienced in February. Our people and our infrastructure were put to the test literally and performed remarkably during that bitter cold stretch when temperatures dropped to minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. I'm pleased to report that the investments we've made in our energy grid and our diverse fuel mix kept the economy moving and our customers safe and warm. Now as you know, just over a year has passed since we first saw the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commitment to safety, efficiency and reliability has only been enhanced by the operational challenges we faced. Our company today stands stronger than ever. And our $16.1 billion capital plan, the largest in company history, is on track. 
Over the next 5 years, we expect our investment plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it will bolster our sustainability as we continue to invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art infrastructure. In fact, the potential we see in renewables and battery storage, the progress we made across our system already and supportive public policy have allowed us to step back and reassess our future environmental goals. So today, I'm pleased to announce that we're setting even more aggressive targets for the next several years. Our goal is now a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; some operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we continue to execute our capital plan. And of course, our long-term goal remains net 0 carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. 
In addition, on the natural gas distribution side of our business, we're now targeting net 0 methane emissions by the end of 2030. Our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and incorporate renewable natural gas into our system will clearly help us achieve this 2030 milestone. You'll be able to read more about these goals and our updated climate report. We'll be launching that report on our website tomorrow morning. 
As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're making really good headway on our capital plan. We call it our ESG progress plan. Since our last visit with you, we've announced 4 renewable projects for our regulated business in Wisconsin, and another wind project, the J Hawk wind farm at our WEC infrastructure segment. Scott and Kevin are on tap to fill you in on the details. But I will add 2 important points about the impact of our ESG progress plan. As we continue to reshape our asset mix, we project that less than 10% of our revenues and less than 10% of our assets will be tied to coal by the end of 2025. And we would more than triple our investment in renewables across our enterprise. You put it all together, we expect to deliver among the best risk-adjusted returns the industry has to offer. We have strong credit quality and no need to issue equity. At the heart of it all is our ability to deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy that our customers depend on. 
Now switching gears for a moment. Let's take a quick look at the regional economy. With the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccinations well underway, we're seeing more signs of economic recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands today at 3.8%. That's close to pre-pandemic levels and more than 1 percentage point better than the national average. In addition, our recent business survey by the University of Wisconsin confirmed that all core indicators of productivity to income are looking up. Also, you may have seen the announcement last week that Foxconn has reached a new agreement with the state of Wisconsin regarding Foxconn's high-tech campus South of Milwaukee. The agreement provides for up to $80 million of performance-based incentives if Foxconn hires 1,454 qualified workers and invest $672 million by 2026. It also importantly gives Foxconn the flexibility to be responsive to the marketplace. This time, the Foxconn campus is expected to focus on producing computer servers and server parts. That's one of Foxconn specialties. In fact, we understand that Foxconn supplies approximately 40% of the worldwide market for servers. Foxconn also noted that over time, it plans to make the Wisconsin site, one of the largest, if not the largest manufacturer of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So as business opportunities continue to arise, Foxconn will work with the state on contract changes that would incorporate additional jobs and more new investment beyond this agreement. 
As we look further across our service area, we see numerous green shoots of growth. For example, Green Bay Packaging just completed a $500 million expansion of its paper mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. Amazon continues to expand. The company just announced another fulfillment center. This one will be located in one of our western suburbs. And Uline is growing again, building 2 new distribution warehouses in the Kenosha area south of Milwaukee, with a projected investment of $130 million. If you're not familiar with the name, Uline is one of the nation's leading distributors of shipping, industrial and packaging materials. So with all the developments we're seeing in the ground, we remain optimistic about the growth of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 7,000 more electric customers and 25,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 10 of the earnings packet. In Wisconsin, we saw sales growth on a weather normal basis across our entire retail business compared to the first quarter of 2020. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.2%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased by 0.5 of 1%. Retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 1.1% from the first quarter of 2020, and on a weather normal basis, were up 1.4%. Overall, our growth is tracking ahead of our forecast as the economy begins to open up. As we once in March, we are adding another project to our infrastructure segment. We acquired a 90% ownership interest in the Jayhawk wind farm. This project will be built in Kansas and consists of 70 wind turbines with a combined capacity of more than 190 megawatts. Jayhawk is expected to go in service by the end of this year. This project fits our investment criteria well. It is a long-term offtake agreement with Facebook for all the energy produced. We plan to invest $302 million for the 90% ownership interest and substantially all the tax benefits. 
As a reminder, our Thunderhead wind investment is now projected to go in service by year-end. We now have 7 wind projects announced or in operations in our infrastructure segment. This represents $1.9 billion of investment with a strong pipeline of opportunities ahead, we expect to invest an additional $1.5 billion in this segment through 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

We continue to realize efficiencies across our system of companies and we'll apply the lessons learned as we design workforce practices post-pandemic. 
Now let me touch on some recent developments in our ESG progress plan. Since our last call, we announced 4 large-scale renewable projects for our Wisconsin Utilities. The Paris, Darian and Koskan Solar Battery Park as well as the Red Barn Wind Park. In total, our shares of these projects would provide 675 megawatts of solar generation, 316 megawatts of battery storage and 82 megawatts of wind. Upon the commission's approval, we will invest approximately $1.5 billion to bring them online between 2022 and 2024. We expect these projects to deliver significant operating cost savings and maintain reliability. These projects, of course, are all part of our plans to invest significant capital dollars in renewables and battery storage for utilities between 2021 and 2025. More to come in the next few months. We are also proposing to build 128 megawatts of generation at our existing Westing power plant site in Northwest Wisconsin. The new facility will use 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them, units. If approved, we expect to invest $170 million in this project for a targeted in-service date in 2023. 
On the natural gas distribution side, We Energies is making its way through the approval process for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. Pending approvals, which we anticipate by the end of this year, we would expect to bring the facilities in operation late in 2023. 
Now for a few regulatory updates. On March 30, we filed a request for the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to forego a rate case filing this year after we reached an agreement with the MA customer and environmental groups. We look forward to the commission's decision in 60 to 90 days. At this time, we're in the midst of rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. North Shore Gas and Michigan Gas Utilities. These proceedings are to support important investments in our distribution infrastructure. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Our 2021 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our favorable results for the first quarter of 2021 were driven by a number of factors. These included the continued execution of our capital plan, colder winter weather conditions, stronger weather-normalized sales, increased production tax credits, lower interest expense and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 14. 
I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2020. First, colder winter weather conditions when compared to the first quarter of last year, drove a $0.05 increase in earnings. Also, rate adjustments and weather-normalized sales added $0.05 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Negative drivers included $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.02 increase in day-to-day O&M expense. The increase in O&M expense was more than offset by the favorable performance of our rabbi trust performance. Rabbi trust investments included in the corporate and other segments. Overall, we added $0.04 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. 
Moving on to our investment in American transmission company. We picked up $0.01 related to continued capital investment. Recall that our investment is now earning a return on equity of 10.52%. We are aware of the recent proposal to remove incentive ROE adders for RTO membership. The past, ATC would lose a 50 basis point ROE adder. On an annualized basis, it would be a $0.02 earnings drag for WEC. Of course, we're watching this development closely. 
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Blooming wind farm placed in service in December 2020 and the Tatanka Ridge wind farm, which came online in early January. 
Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segment increased $0.11, driven by improved rabbi trust investment performance, some favorable tax items resolved in the quarter and lower interest expense. 
In summary, we improved on our first quarter 2020 performance by $0.18 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate would be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Despite in natural gas costs seen throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with customer arrears, contributed to this increase in working capital. However, with normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to improve throughout the remainder of the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $590 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $94 million increase from 2020. 
On the financing front, with the $600 million holdco issuance in March, along with our refinancing efforts last year, the average interest rate on our holdco senior notes is now 1.8% compared to 3.5% a year ago. This will continue to provide a favorable interest variance throughout the year. 
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. For the quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.75 to $0.77 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.76 per share in the second quarter last year. Excluding $0.03 of better-than-normal weather and a $0.03 pickup from a FERC ROE decision, we would have earned $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Gale mentioned earlier, we're guiding to the top end of our range for the full year. And as a reminder, that range is $3.99 per share to $4.03 per share. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Coupled with the fact that not only is the time running out in terms of the length of the legislative session, but also understanding is legislature has to deal with a budget for Illinois, which has been historically contentious and redistricting. So there is a lot on their plate. And we'll see what happens, but the number of competing bills, lots of discussion going on, we'll see if anything really does take place. But I would remind everyone that the focus remains very much on the electric side of the business there, which we're not involved with. On potential subsidies for Exelon's nuclear plants. So there are lots of things going on there. I suspect that the  rider, for example, that we have at Peoples Gas is not necessarily the major focus of what's going on right now. We'll see. But again, even if that rider were to be repealed, and I don't really think it will, then we would revert all of the utilities would simply revert to normal rate cases with forward-looking test periods.

But first, let me address something that I think is not particularly well understood about the Foxconn situation. Because I think it's important in terms of how it plays into our sales forecast. So we talked about the revised agreement with the state. Importantly, that agreement with the state runs through basically 2026. The earlier, the first agreement that Foxconn had with the state was a much longer-term agreement. So it would be a mistake to think that what's on the table now, where Foxconn has clear line of visibility on what they will produce at the campus. It's a mistake to think that, that's all there is. In fact, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Foxconn is still saying that their aspirational goal is to make this campus one of the largest producers of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So the door is wide open for future projects beyond this period. And again, the first agreement the state had with Foxconn ran more than 10 years. This agreement is shorter-term and deliberately so, but does not preclude additional long-term investment. In fact, the door is open for additional long-term investment at that campus. Having said all that, and I would Scott view our sales forecast that we publicly announced, that's pretty darn solid."

So I think overall, again, probably way too early to tell. However, there are a couple of things that seem to have very strong consensus. The first, I think, would be very beneficial, not only to our industry, but to our company in specific, and that's the extension of the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, the application of tax credits to battery storage and the additional drive toward continuing to incentivize renewables. That obviously will be extremely helpful going forward. And I suspect, just based on everything we're seeing and hearing and as we talk to folks in Washington, I think those particular items have very strong consensus and support. In addition to that, I don't know if there's any question that if all of these tax credits continue to be extended and applied across the board as we expect they will be, there will continue to be more renewable development, which is helpful to us, particularly in terms of our infrastructure segment and actually our regulated segment as well, but also a continued drive toward expansion of transmission. And as you may have seen, and Kevin has got some very specific statistics, MISO has made a very interesting projection for the next 20 years on how much additional investment just in the mid -- the MISO footprint that they project for additional transmission that would support renewables.

Do you see this impacting your service territory and investment opportunity, even just thinking about Line 5 is kind of a high-profile example here where your state appears somewhat at odds with this focus. If you have any thoughts you could share here, that would be helpful."

Well, first of all, a bedrock of our entire approach to managing this business and serving customers has been resilience and reliability. As I mentioned earlier, that focus, that execution came through in spades when the polar vortex event associated with Yuri, when temperatures hit minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. So at the state level, I think our Public Service Commission, I think the gubernatorial administration there, they have been very supportive of resilience and reliability. And that, for example, is another reason why, just to make -- to maintain resilience and reliability and very difficult climates during the winter it's another reason why we're optimistic that we'll get approval for the LNG storage facilities that we have before the Public Service Commission today. So I don't see state policy, particularly Public Service Commission position in any way, being in odds with resilience or reliability in our region. In fact, I think the recent events just underscore how important that is."

We've seen 2 or 3 cycles over the last 30 years or so, driven by different motivations, I think. So I'm not sure that comparing the cycles is necessarily the right thing to do because I think the motivations for the M&A were different. Having said all of that, longer term, I still believe we're in a consolidating industry. I still believe that scale matters. The good news is we have significant scale and continuing efficiency opportunities. But I think over time, you'll probably see a different form of M&A, at least in my opinion than what you saw over the last 5 or 6 years. I think less in terms of premiums, and more in terms of mergers of equal-type opportunities. Scale still does matter. Growth still does matter. Efficiency still does matter. So we've clearly seen a lull, as you probably would expect, going through a pandemic. I don't think there's going to be a giant uptick immediately in M&A in our industry. But over time, I do believe it's still a consolidating industry. But I would suspect that the criteria be much closer to the ones that we use. And I can just briefly repeat those again, if you'd like, and that is, we'd have to be convinced after significant due diligence that an acquisition would be additive or accretive to earnings per share in the first full year after closing. The second is we've worked very hard to have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry, and we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it. And the third is really important as well, and that is that you'd have to really believe that the growth rate of anything that we would acquire would be at least as strong as our own organic growth rate. So read that at least 5% to 7% a year. Hope that answers your question, Michael."

And just to be clear, again, I think you're raising an important point. By the end of 2025, we would expect our revenues and our asset base tied to coal will be both be less than 10%. And the reason we wanted to mention that is I think there's perhaps been a perception among some investors that we still have a very large portion of our asset-based type but simply as we reshape our energy and our asset mix, that's simply not the case, number one. The other thing that I think is really an important point here is that we can achieve not only the 2025 goal, but also the very aggressive 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by the end of 2030 with existing technology, some operating refinements and some retirements. And so that, I think, gives you a sense of how dynamic our reshaping of our asset mix is and how small the reliance will continue to be, obviously, less than 10% by 2025 and we think lower than that by 2030."

If we think about some are blaming what happened in Texas and maybe fault of some of the renewable projects that were going there? And given how strong your total infrastructure worked this past winter, does that maybe cause any pause on build-out of renewables?"

And I think the honest answer is we have an intelligent and very well informed State Public Service Commission here.  They recognize that basically for -- to give you a very specific example, during the polar vortex event in February, we had to have everything running to keep the lights out of the gas flowing, everything. The coal units, the nuclear units, the wind farms, the solar. Everything had to be operating given the demands that we saw. So to the contrary, I think the diversity of our fuel mix  and the way it performed and needed to perform for public safety, I think, underscores the fact that we have to have a diverse fuel mix going forward. And clearly, we think we can maintain not only I think we know we can maintain reliability by adding this amount of renewables, but it's possible because we have such efficient, strong, dispatchable fossil units. So put that all together, and we can still achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions. So I hope that responds to your question, Anthony."

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CE",1081,"Well, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.  
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $1.61 a share. As always, our focus on operating excellence was a major factor in our performance. In addition, we saw the positive impact of colder weather and economic recovery in our region. Xia will provide you with more details on our metrics in just a few minutes.  
But first, a comment about the polar vortex event that experienced in February. Our people and our infrastructure were put to the test literally and performed remarkably during that bitter cold stretch when temperatures dropped to minus 42 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern portion of our service area. I'm pleased to report that the investments we've made in our energy grid and our diverse fuel mix kept the economy moving and our customers safe and warm. Now as you know, just over a year has passed since we first saw the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commitment to safety, efficiency and reliability has only been enhanced by the operational challenges we faced. Our company today stands stronger than ever. And our $16.1 billion capital plan, the largest in company history, is on track.  
Over the next 5 years, we expect our investment plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it will bolster our sustainability as we continue to invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art infrastructure. In fact, the potential we see in renewables and battery storage, the progress we made across our system already and supportive public policy have allowed us to step back and reassess our future environmental goals. So today, I'm pleased to announce that we're setting even more aggressive targets for the next several years. Our goal is now a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; some operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we continue to execute our capital plan. And of course, our long-term goal remains net zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050.  
In addition, on the natural gas distribution side of our business, we're now targeting net zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. Our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and incorporate renewable natural gas into our system will clearly help us achieve this 2030 milestone. You'll be able to read more about these goals on our updated climate report. We'll be launching that report on our website tomorrow morning.  
As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're making really good headway on our capital plan. We call it our ESG progress plan. Since our last visit with you, we've announced 4 renewable projects for our regulated business in Wisconsin, and another wind project, the Jayhawk wind farm at our WEC Infrastructure segment. Scott and Kevin are on tap to fill you in on the details. But I will add 2 important points about the impact of our ESG progress plan. As we continue to reshape our asset mix, we project that less than 10% of our revenues and less than 10% of our assets will be tied to coal by the end of 2025. And we would more than triple our investment in renewables across our enterprise. You put it all together and we expect to deliver among the best risk-adjusted returns the industry has to offer. We have strong credit quality and no need to issue equity. At the heart of it all is our ability to deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy that our customers depend on.  
Now switching gears for a moment. Let's take a quick look at the regional economy. With the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccinations well underway, we're seeing more signs of economic recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands today at 3.8%. That's close to pre-pandemic levels and more than 1 percentage point better than the national average. In addition, our recent business survey by the University of Wisconsin confirmed that all core indicators of productivity to income are looking up. Also, you may have seen the announcement last week that Foxconn has reached a new agreement with the state of Wisconsin regarding Foxconn's high-tech campus South of Milwaukee. 
The agreement provides for up to $80 million of performance-based incentives if Foxconn hires 1,454 qualified workers and invest $672 million by 2026. It also importantly gives Foxconn the flexibility to be responsive to the marketplace. This time, the Foxconn campus is expected to focus on producing computer servers and server parts. That's one of Foxconn specialties. In fact, we understand that Foxconn supplies approximately 40% of the worldwide market for servers. Foxconn had also noted that over time, it plans to make the Wisconsin site one of the largest, if not the largest, manufacturer of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So as business opportunities continue to arise, Foxconn will work with the state on contract changes that would incorporate additional jobs and more new investment beyond this agreement.
As we look further across our service area, we see numerous green shoots of growth. For example, Green Bay Packaging just completed a $500 million expansion of its paper mill in Northeastern Wisconsin. Amazon continues to expand. The company just announced another fulfillment center. This one will be located in one of our western suburbs. And Uline is growing again, building 2 new distribution warehouses in the Kenosha area south of Milwaukee, with a projected investment of $130 million. If you're not familiar with the name, Uline is one of the nation's leading distributors of shipping, industrial and packaging materials. So with all the developments we're seeing in the ground, we remain optimistic about the growth of the regional economy and our long-term sales growth.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 7,000 more electric customers and 25,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 10 of the earnings packet. In Wisconsin, we saw sales growth on a weather normal basis across our entire retail business compared to the first quarter of 2020. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.2%.
This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased by 0.5 of 1%. Retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 1.1% from the first quarter of 2020, and on a weather normal basis, were up 1.4%. Overall, our growth is tracking ahead of our forecast as the economy begins to open up. As we announced in March, we are adding another project to our infrastructure segment. We acquired a 90% ownership interest in the Jayhawk wind farm. This project will be built in Kansas and consists of 70 wind turbines with a combined capacity of more than 190 megawatts. Jayhawk is expected to go in service by the end of this year. This project fits our investment criteria well. It is a long-term offtake agreement with Facebook for all the energy produced. We plan to invest $302 million for the 90% ownership interest and substantially all the tax benefits. 
As a reminder, our Thunderhead wind investment is now projected to go in service by year-end. We now have 7 wind projects announced or in operations in our infrastructure segment. This represents $1.9 billion of investment. With a strong pipeline of opportunities ahead, we expect to invest an additional $1.5 billion in this segment through 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

We remain focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. We continue to realize efficiencies across our system of companies and we'll apply the lessons learned as we design workforce practices post-pandemic. 
Now let me touch on some recent developments in our ESG progress plan. Since our last call, we announced 4 large-scale renewable projects for our Wisconsin Utilities. The Paris, Darian and Koshkonong solar battery parks as well as the Red Barn wind park. In total, our shares of these projects would provide 675 megawatts of solar generation, 316 megawatts of battery storage and 82 megawatts of wind. 
Pending the commission's approval, we will invest approximately $1.5 billion to bring them online between 2022 and 2024. We expect these projects to deliver significant operating cost savings and maintain reliability. These projects, of course, are all part of our plans to invest significant capital dollars in renewables and battery storage for utilities between 2021 and 2025. More to come in the next few months. We are also proposing to build 128 megawatts of generation at our existing Weston Power Plant site in Northwest Wisconsin. The new facility will use 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them, RICE units. If approved, we expect to invest $170 million in this project for a targeted in-service date in 2023. 
On the natural gas distribution side, We Energies is making its way through the approval process for 2 liquefied natural gas facilities, which would provide enhanced savings and reliability during our cold winters. Pending approvals, which we anticipate by the end of this year, we would expect to bring the facilities in operation late in 2023. 
Now for a few regulatory updates. On March 30, we filed a request to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to forego a rate case filing this year after we reached an agreement with the major customer and environmental groups. We look forward to the commission's decision in 60 to 90 days. At this time, we're in the midst of rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. North Shore Gas and Michigan Gas Utilities. These proceedings are to support important investments in our distribution infrastructure. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

Our 2021 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our favorable results for the first quarter of 2021 were driven by a number of factors. These included the continued execution of our capital plan, colder winter weather conditions, stronger weather-normalized sales, increased production tax credits, lower interest expense and continued emphasis on operating efficiency. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 14. 
I'll walk through the significant drivers impacting our earnings per share. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2020. First, colder winter weather conditions when compared to the first quarter of last year, drove a $0.05 increase in earnings. Also, rate adjustments and weather-normalized sales added $0.05 compared to the first quarter of 2020. Negative drivers included $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.02 increase in day-to-day O&M expense. The increase in O&M expense was more than offset by the favorable performance of our rabbi trust performance. Rabbi trust investments included in the corporate and other segments. Overall, we added $0.04 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. 
Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. We picked up $0.01 related to continued capital investment. Recall that our investment is now earning a return on equity of 10.52%. We are aware of the recent proposal to remove incentive ROE adders for RTO membership. With that, ATC would lose a 50 basis point ROE adder. On an annualized basis, it would be a $0.02 earnings drag for WEC. Of course, we're watching this development closely. 
Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020, primarily from production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. These include the Blooming Grove wind farm placed in service in December 2020 and the Tatanka Ridge wind farm, which came online in early January. 
Finally, you'll see that earnings at our corporate and other segment increased $0.11, driven by improved rabbi trust investment performance, some favorable tax items resolved in the quarter and lower interest expense. 
In summary, we improved on our first quarter 2020 performance by $0.18 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate would be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $295 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first quarter of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Despite in natural gas costs seen throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with customer arrears, contributed to this increase in working capital. However, with normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to improve throughout the remainder of the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $590 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $94 million increase from 2020. 
On the financing front, with the $600 million holdco issuance in March, along with our refinancing efforts last year, the average interest rate on our holdco senior notes is now 1.8% compared to 3.5% a year ago. This will continue to provide a favorable interest variance throughout the year. 
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2021. For the quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.75 to $0.77 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.76 per share in the second quarter last year. Excluding $0.03 of better-than-normal weather and a $0.03 pickup from a FERC ROE decision, we would have earned $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Gale mentioned earlier, we're guiding to the top end of our range for the full year. And as a reminder, that range is $3.99 per share to $4.03 per share. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

So there is a lot on their plate. And we'll see what happens, but the number of competing bills, lots of discussion going on. We'll see if anything really does take place. 
But I would remind everyone that the focus remains very much on the electric side of the business there, which we're not involved with. On potential subsidies for Exelon's nuclear plants. So there are lots of things going on there. I suspect the rider, for example, that we have at Peoples Gas is not necessarily the major focus of what's going on right now. We'll see. But again, even if that rider were to be repealed, and I don't really think it will, then we would revert all of the utilities would simply revert to normal rate cases with forward-looking test periods. So time will tell, but we're not overly concerned at the moment in terms of the future of what needs to be done in Illinois."

But first, let me address something that I think is not particularly well understood about the Foxconn situation. Because I think it's important in terms of how it plays into our sales forecast. So we talked about the revised agreement with the state. Importantly, that agreement with the state runs through basically 2026. The earlier, the first agreement that Foxconn had with the state was a much longer-term agreement. So it would be a mistake to think that what's on the table now where Foxconn has clear line of visibility on what they will produce at the campus. It's a mistake to think that, that's all there is. 
In fact, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Foxconn is still saying that their aspirational goal is to make this campus one of the largest producers of data infrastructure hardware in the United States. So the door is wide open for future projects beyond this period. And again, the first agreement the state had with Foxconn ran more than 10 years. This agreement is shorter-term and deliberately so, but does not preclude additional long-term investment. In fact, the door is open for additional long-term investment at that campus. Having said all that, and I would, Scott, view our sales forecast that we publicly announced, that's pretty darn solid."

I think our overall view probably can be summarized in maybe 3 points. The first is way too early to tell. As you can imagine -- you can imagine the sausage making and the concessions and the changes that are going to take place over the course of, I think, an extended period of debate, particularly to craft something that could get through the Senate. So I think overall, again, probably way too early to tell. However, there are a couple of things that seem to have very strong consensus. The first, I think, would be very beneficial, not only to our industry, but to our company in specific, and that's the extension of the production tax credits, the investment tax credits, the application of tax credits to battery storage and the additional drive toward continuing to incentivize renewables. That obviously will be extremely helpful going forward. 
And I suspect, just based on everything we're seeing and hearing as we talk to folks in Washington, I think those particular items have very strong consensus and support. In addition to that, I don't know if there's any question that if all of these tax credits continue to be extended and applied across the board as we expect they will be, there will continue to be more renewable development, which is helpful to us, particularly in terms of our infrastructure segment and actually our regulated segment as well, but also a continued drive toward expansion of transmission. And as you may have seen, and Kevin has got some very specific statistics, MISO has made a very interesting projection for the next 20 years on how much additional investment just in the mid -- the MISO made as footprint that they project for additional transmission that would support renewables.

And that, for example, is another reason why, just to maintain resilience and reliability and very difficult climates during the winter. It's another reason why we're optimistic that we'll get approval for the LNG storage facilities that we have before the Public Service Commission today.

We've seen 2 or 3 cycles over the last 30 years or so, driven by different motivations, I think. So I'm not sure that comparing the cycles is necessarily the right thing to do because I think the motivations for the M&A were different. Having said all of that, longer term, I still believe we're in a consolidating industry. I still believe that scale matters. The good news is we have significant scale and continuing efficiency opportunities. But I think over time, you'll probably see a different form of M&A, at least in my opinion, than what you saw over the last 5 or 6 years. I think less in terms of premiums, and more in terms of mergers of equal-type opportunities. 
Scale still does matter. Growth still does matter. Efficiency still does matter. So we've clearly seen a lull, as you probably would expect, going through a pandemic. I don't think there's going to be a giant uptick immediately in M&A in our industry. But over time, I do believe it's still a consolidating industry. But I would suspect that the criteria will be much closer to the ones that we use. And I can just briefly repeat those again, if you'd like, and that is, we'd have to be convinced after significant due diligence that an acquisition would be additive or accretive to earnings per share in the first full year after closing. The second is we've worked very hard to have one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry, and we're not going to trash the balance sheet to do it. And the third is really important as well, and that is that you'd have to really believe that the growth rate of anything that we would acquire would be at least as strong as our own organic growth rate. So read that at least 5% to 7% a year. Hope that answers your question, Michael."

And just to be clear, again, I think you're raising an important point. By the end of 2025, we would expect our revenues and our asset base tied to coal will be both be less than 10%. And the reason we wanted to mention that is I think there's perhaps been a perception among some investors that we still have a very large portion of our asset-based type. That's simply -- as we reshape our energy and our asset mix, that's simply not the case, number one. The other thing that I think is really an important point here is that we can achieve not only the 2025 goal, but also the very aggressive 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by the end of 2030 with existing technology, some operating refinements and some retirements. And so that, I think, gives you a sense of how dynamic our reshaping of our asset mix is and how small the reliance will continue to be, obviously, less than 10% by 2025 and we think lower than that by 2030."

If we think about -- some are blaming what happened in Texas maybe fault of some of the renewable projects that were going there. And given how strong your fossil infrastructure worked this past winter, does that maybe cause any pause on build-out of renewables?"

They recognize that basically for -- to give you a very specific example, during the polar vortex event in February, we had to have everything running to keep the lights on and the gas flowing, everything. The coal units, the nuclear units, the wind farms, the solar. Everything had to be operating given the demands that we saw. So to the contrary, I think the diversity of our fuel mix just -- and the way it performed and needed to perform for public safety, I think, underscores the fact that we have to have a diverse fuel mix going forward. And clearly, we think we can maintain -- not only think, we know we can maintain reliability by adding this amount of renewables, but it's possible because we have such efficient, strong, dispatchable fossil units. So put that all together, and we can still achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions. So I hope that responds to your question, Anthony."

And I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot. So good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.87 a share. Xia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes. But given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance. The new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share, and our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range. As always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Now as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level. Our companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction. A solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth.
Our balance sheet is strong. We have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan, and our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments. As you may know, we expect our ESG progress plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it's bolstering our sustainability as we invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art technology.
A good example of our progress is the announcement we made just a week ago about a $400 million investment in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. Scott will provide you with more detail on this development in just a moment. But I will tell you that the offtake agreement is with one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, and we expect the project to meet or exceed all of our financial metrics.
We've also made great progress on our plan to build 1,800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind and battery storage. These carbon-free assets will play a significant role in improving our environmental footprint. Recall that back in May, we set near-term goals that are among the most ambitious in the industry: reducing carbon emissions by 60% from our electric generation fleet by 2025 and achieving an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Go ahead that we now expect only 8% of of our regulated electricity supply to come from coal by the end of 2030.
We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units, operating refinements and the use of existing technology as we execute our ESG progress plan. Of course, our long-term goal remains net-zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. And our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and introduce renewable natural gas into our system will help us achieve another aggressive goal: net-zero methane emissions by 2030. You can learn more about these goals and much more in our corporate responsibility report, which we published just last week.
And now let's switch gears a bit and take a quick look at our regional economy. We're still seeing the positive effects of a strong recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate, in fact, stands today at 3.9%. Folks, that's 2 full percentage points better than the national average. And as I mentioned, business continues to grow with new projects across the region. For example, Milwaukee Tool is expanding the operations again here in Milwaukee. If you're not familiar with Milwaukee Tool, company has been a leader in the development of battery-powered cordless tools. It now has become the world's #1 producer of tools for professionals in the construction trades, utility sector as well as for auto mechanics. And now Milwaukee Tool is redeveloping a vacant downtown office tower to provide space for 1,200 new employees over the next 5 years. In addition, a number of other economic development projects are in the pipeline, and we'll be covering those with you in future calls.
On that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 4,000 more electric customers and 18,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet.
Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 7.1% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 5.8%. We are encouraged by the economic rebound we are seeing in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 10.4% from last year's second quarter and on a weather-normal basis were up 9.2%. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 14.8% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 13.9%.
Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were down 4.9%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%. Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up.
Turning now to our WEC infrastructure segment. As Gale noted, we have agreed to acquire a 90% ownership interest in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy segment. The project is being developed in the Clean County, Illinois by Invenergy. The site will consist of 64 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. We expect it will go in service late in 2022.
The project fits our investment criteria very well. We plan to invest $412 million for the 90% ownership interest. We now have 8 wind projects announced or in operation in our infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investment. We expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in this segment over the remainder of our 5-year plan.
Our J Hawk wind farm is projected to go in service by early next year, and our Thunder Headwind investment is now projected to go in service in the first half of 2022. These time lines have been factored into our forecast.
In case you're wondering about the impact of inflation on these projects, to date, we have not encountered any significant inflationary pressure. Remember that we primarily invest in turnkey projects with developers. So we are seeing no reduction of returns.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow One solar project is nearing completion and is producing test energy. As you may recall, we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin, and Madison Gas and Electric owns the remaining 50 megawatts. This is our second large-scale solar project and part of our plans for more than triple renewable energy between 2021 and 2025. We expect the next phase of the project, Page Hallau, to achieve commercial operations next year.
Now for a few regulatory updates. When called after reaching an agreement with a major customer and environmental groups, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission to forego a rate base for our Wisconsin utilities this year. We expect a decision in the weeks to come. And we're pleased that the commission has approved pilot programs for electric vehicle charging in our Wisconsin service areas. With these programs, we plan to install charging equipment and electric distribution infrastructure. This is the first step in our effort to promote affordable charging options for electric vehicles.
And we also have updates on the rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. In Illinois, earlier this year, North Shore Gas requested a rate increase primarily due to the significant capital investments we have made since the last rate case in 2015. Recently, the administrative law judge on the case issued a proposed order. The order recommends a $4.2 million rate increase on a 9.67% ROE and 51.6% equity component. We expect the commission's final decision by mid-September.
Finally, in Michigan, I'm pleased to advise you that we have reached a settlement with all parties to conclude our rate review for Michigan Gas Utilities. This settlement stipulates a 9.85% return on equity and a revenue increase of $9.25 million with an equity layer of 51.5%. We expect the commission's approval by the end of the third quarter. We have no other rate cases pending at this time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia."

Our 2021 second quarter earnings of $0.87 per share increased $0.11 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from warmer-than-normal weather, recovering economy, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency. The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.
Starting with our utility operations. We grew our earnings by $0.09 compared to the second quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic drove a $0.06 increase in earnings. This reflects stronger weather normalized sales as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges. Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.01, and all other factors resulted in a positive variance of $0.02. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense.
I'd like to point out that quarter-over-quarter, the impact of weather was flat. Overall, we added $0.09 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations.
Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. Earnings decreased $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2020. While we picked up $0.01 in the current quarter from continued capital investment, this was more than offset by a $0.03 benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2020 related to a FERC order. Recall that this order allowed ATC to increase its ROE from 10.38% to 10.52% retroactive to November 2013.
Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions, partially offset by less-than-projected wind resources.
Finally, we saw a $0.03 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. Lower interest expense contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter. We recognized a $0.03 gain from our investment in a fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. These positive variances were partially offset by a reduction of $0.01 in rabbi trust performance and $0.01 in taxes and other. In summary, we improved on our second quarter 2020 performance by $0.11.
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $153 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 6 months of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Recall that despite in natural gas costs seeing throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with higher accounts receivable balances, contributed to this increase in working capital.
We were able to improve our working capital position in the second quarter. With normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.1 billion for the first 6 months of 2021, a $93 million increase as compared with the first 6 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and Energy Infrastructure business.
On the financing front, we continue to find opportunities to lower our interest costs. In fact, in June, we refinanced $300 million of debt at Wisconsin Electric, reducing the average coupon of these notes by over 1.2% and extending the maturity to 2028.
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.72 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. This also takes into account timing of our fuel recovery and the costs associated with major storms that impacted our system last week.
As a reminder, we earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter last year. This includes an estimated $0.05 of better-than-normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2021 earnings guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

In addition to raising our annual guidance, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth 5% to 7% a year, with a strong bias towards the upper half of that range.
And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As you may recall, in January, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by by 7.1% to $0.6775 a share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Overall, ladies and gentlemen, we're on track, focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.

But historically, I think for all the years I've been here, when we've laid out our 5-year capital plan, you've always seen a bit of a downturn compared to the first 3 years for years 4 and 5.

You're not going to see -- I would be stunned if you saw any kind of a decline in what is now years 4 and 5. It's just not going to happen, not going to happen in particular because of the strong investment opportunity that we have in front of us.
And what kind of buckets might we see? Well, clearly, there's going to be an additional emphasis on continuing to invest in renewables and battery storage, distribution upgrades, new customer connections, you name it. It will be across the board. But as you know, a very significant tailwind as we continue to execute our ESG progress plan, continue to reach those lofty environmental goals, those aggressive environmental goals.

We're really, frankly, not seeing a ton. I think as we phrased it, really not -- no significant impact so far. Now part of that is because of the way we deal with our infrastructure segment and the fact that we have set prices with developers that have very long history of being able to procure at very positive and constructive prices. So on the infrastructure side, we haven't really seen any significant impact at all.
On the regulated side, again, a lot of the projects that we have underway, procurement has already taken place. So not much at this stage of the game in terms of inflationary impact.
Where we have seen where we have seen some inflationary impact is actually in the natural gas commodity prices. Gosh, we were up over $4 per million Btu just the other day. So there, I think -- with the glut of natural gas a bit disappearing across the country, I think we're going to see some elevated natural gas prices, certainly for winter -- the upcoming winter. But that's where, in my opinion, we're seeing the first kind of signs.
And then in terms of the future, it's anybody's guess how sticky the inflation numbers are but one of the things that I always tend to look at for what it's worth. Remember, Milton Friedman said that inflation is -- has been and always will be a monetary phenomenon. So one of the things I think that we look at is essentially the growth of the money supply. And if you look at the growth of the money supply, it's already begun to taper off a little bit. It's still up and up materially, but it's already begun to taper off a little bit. So that gives me some hope that while we probably for the next year, we'll see some elevated inflation numbers, perhaps it's on its way to a more normal level."

Going forward, I know there's been a lot of discussion around the industry about lower returns, about backlogs and delays. But I would say if you look at our pipeline of potential projects, it is still very robust. And we're working with potential projects and developers that have long successful track records. We don't see right now any diminution of the kind of projects that we're interested in for our infrastructure segment or, and importantly, we're not seeing any significant diminution in returns.

I'm going to ask Scott to give you his view on this as well. Let me just say 2 quick things. I mean essentially, with the retirement of older coal-fired units that has already taken place on our system, with the announced retirements that we've talked about already, really, there's very little coal-fired capacity left in our system after 2025.
Like you and others, we're asked about the new units at our Oak Creek site. Those new units are very efficient, among the most efficient thermal-fired power plants in the world. And I should remind everybody that what we need to do in looking at the future of those units is to separate the value of those units from the fuel source. And let me explain that.
The new Oak Creek units are ideally situated on the transmission grid in the Midwest. They are very important to reliability in the middle western part of the United States, not just Wisconsin. So we built those units. And remember, the first unit came online in 2010, the second in 2011. We built those units with some flexibility. In fact, I mean there is natural gas into the site. It is possible, and we've done it several times to coal fire the units on coal and natural gas. And yes, it is possible -- technically possible for the units to be converted away from coal to natural gas at some point. In fact, we are taking a look at both from an engineering standpoint and a cost standpoint the feasibility of doing so.
Scott, what would you like to add to that?"

And I'm not sure I can top all of that, but no pun intended, let's give it a shot. 
So good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.87 a share. Xia will provide you with more details in just a few minutes. But given our strong performance through the first half of this year, we're raising our annual guidance. The new range is $4.02 a share to $4.05 a share, and our expectation is that we will reach the top end of that range. As always, this assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
Now as we look across our business lines, I'm pleased to report that every segment is performing at a high level. Our companies continue to deliver superior reliability and customer satisfaction. A solid economic recovery in Wisconsin with commercial and industrial expansion gives us confidence in our projected sales growth.
Our balance sheet is strong. We have no need to issue new equity to fund our ESG progress plan, and our plan is well on track for both our regulated and our infrastructure segments. As you may know, we expect our ESG progress plan to drive average annual growth in our asset base of 7%. At the same time, it's bolstering our sustainability as we invest in renewable energy and state-of-the-art technology.
A good example of our progress is the announcement we made just a week ago about a $400 million investment in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. Scott will provide you with more detail on this development in just a moment, but I will tell you that the offtake agreement is with one of the largest high-tech companies in the world, and we expect the project to meet or exceed all of our financial metrics.
We've also made great progress on our plan to build 1,800 megawatts of regulated solar, wind and battery storage. These carbon-free assets will play a significant role in improving our environmental footprint. Recall that, back in May, we set near-term goals that are among the most ambitious in the industry: reducing carbon emissions by 60% from our electric generation fleet by 2025 and achieving an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. So ahead that we now expect only 8% of our regulated electricity supply to come from coal by the end of 2030.
We believe we can accomplish these targets with the retirement of older, less efficient units; operating refinements; and the use of existing technology as we execute our ESG progress plan. Of course, our long-term goal remains net-zero carbon emissions from our generating fleet by 2050. And our ongoing effort to upgrade our gas delivery networks and introduce renewable natural gas into our system will help us achieve another aggressive goal: net-zero methane emissions by 2030. You can learn more about these goals and much more in our corporate responsibility report, which we published just last week.
And now let's switch gears a bit and take a quick look at our regional economy. We're still seeing the positive effects of a strong recovery. Wisconsin's unemployment rate, in fact, stands today at 3.9%. Folks, that's 2 full percentage points better than the national average. As I mentioned, business continues to grow with new projects across the region. For example, Milwaukee Tool is expanding the operations again here in Milwaukee. If you're not familiar with Milwaukee Tool, company has been a leader in the development of battery-powered, cordless tools. It now has become the world's #1 producer of tools for professionals in the construction trades, utility sector, as well as for auto mechanics. And now Milwaukee Tool is redeveloping a vacant downtown office tower to provide space for 1,200 new employees over the next 5 years. In addition, a number of other economic development projects are in the pipeline, and we'll be covering those with you in future calls.
On that note, I'll turn our call over to Scott for more detail on our sales results for the quarter, as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 4,000 more electric customers and 18,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. 
Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis, beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet. Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 7.1% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 5.8%. We are encouraged by the economic rebound we are seeing in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 10.4% from last year's second quarter and on a weather-normal basis were up 9.2%. Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 14.8% from the second quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis were up 13.9%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were down 4.9%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%. Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up. 
Turning now to our WEC infrastructure segment. As Gale noted, we have agreed to acquire a 90% ownership interest in the Sapphire Sky Wind Energy Center. The project is being developed in McLean County, Illinois by Invenergy. The site will consist of 64 wind turbines with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. We expect it will go in service late in 2022. The project fits our investment criteria very well. We plan to invest $412 million for the 90% ownership interest. We now have 8 wind projects announced or in operation in our infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investment. We expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in this segment over the remainder of our 5-year plan. 
Our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year, and our Thunderhead Wind investment is now projected to go in service in the first half of 2022. These time lines have been factored into our forecast. 
In case you're wondering about the impact of inflation on these projects, to date, we have not encountered any significant inflationary pressure. Remember that we primarily invest in turnkey projects with developers, so we are seeing no reduction of returns.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

Touching on some recent developments in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow I solar project is nearing completion and is producing test energy. As you may recall, we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin, and Madison Gas and Electric owns the remaining 50 megawatts. This is our second large-scale solar project and part of our plans for more than triple renewable energy between 2021 and 2025 we expect the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, to achieve commercial operations next year.
Now for a few regulatory updates. Recall that after reaching an agreement with a major customer and environmental groups, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission to forego a rate base for our Wisconsin utilities this year. We expect a decision in the weeks to come. And we're pleased that the commission has approved pilot programs for electric vehicle charging in our Wisconsin service areas. With these programs, we plan to install charging equipment and electric distribution infrastructure. This is the first step in our effort to promote affordable charging options for electric vehicles.
And we also have updates on the rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. In Illinois, earlier this year, North Shore Gas requested a rate increase, primarily due to the significant capital investments we have made since the last rate case in 2015. Recently, the administrative law judge on the case issued a proposed order. The order recommends a $4.2 million rate increase on a 9.67% ROE and 51.6% equity component. We expect the commission's final decision by mid-September.
Finally, in Michigan, I'm pleased to advise you that we have reached a settlement with all parties to conclude our rate review for Michigan Gas Utilities. This settlement stipulates a 9.85% return on equity and a revenue increase of $9.25 million with an equity layer of 51.5%. We expect the commission's approval by the end of the third quarter. We have no other rate cases pending at this time.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia."

Our 2021 second quarter earnings of $0.87 per share increased $0.11 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from warmer-than-normal weather, recovering economy, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency. 
The earnings package posted on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.
Starting with our Utility Operations. We grew our earnings by $0.09 compared to the second quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic drove a $0.06 increase in earnings. This reflects stronger weather-normalized sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges. Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.01, and all other factors resulted in a positive variance of $0.02. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense. I'd like to point out that quarter-over-quarter, the impact of weather was flat. Overall, we added $0.09 quarter-over-quarter from Utility Operations.
Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. Earnings decreased $0.02 compared to the second quarter of 2020. While we picked up $0.01 in the current quarter from continued capital investment, this was more than offset by a $0.03 benefit recognized in the second quarter of 2020 related to a FERC order. Recall that this order allowed ATC to increase its ROE from 10.38% to 10.52% retroactive to November 2013.
Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions, partially offset by less-than-projected wind resources.
Finally, we saw a $0.03 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. Lower interest expense contributed $0.02 quarter-over-quarter. We recognized a $0.03 gain from our investment in a fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. These positive variances were partially offset by a reduction of $0.01 in rabbi trust performance and $0.01 in taxes and other. In summary, we improved on our second quarter 2020 performance by $0.11.
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan.
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $153 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 6 months of 2021 was more than offset by higher working capital requirements. Recall that the spike in natural gas costs seen throughout the central part of the country this February, coupled with higher accounts receivable balances, contributed to this increase in working capital. We were able to improve our working capital position in the second quarter. With normal collection practices underway in our major markets, we expect working capital to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year.
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.1 billion for the first 6 months of 2021, a $93 million increase as compared with the first 6 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and Energy Infrastructure business.
On the financing front, we continue to find opportunities to lower our interest costs. In fact, in June, we refinanced $300 million of debt at Wisconsin Electric, reducing the average coupon of these notes by over 1.2% and extending the maturity to 2028.
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.72 to $0.74 per share for the third quarter. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. This also takes into account timing of our fuel recovery and the costs associated with major storms that impacted our system last week.
As a reminder, we earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter last year. This includes an estimated $0.05 of better-than-normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2021 earnings guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.05 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

In addition to raising our annual guidance, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth of 5% to 7% a year with a strong bias towards the upper half of that range.
And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As you may recall, in January, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend by 7.1% to $0.6775 a share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.
Overall, ladies and gentlemen, we're on track, focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.

And the reason for that is we don't like to have a lot of white space and a lot of undefined line items in our 5-year capital plan. So we tend to give you, particularly for the first 3 years, stuff that we know is actually going to be proposed, is actually going to be built upon approval, et cetera.
But historically, I think for all the years I've been here, when we've laid out our 5-year capital plan, you've always seen a bit of a downturn compared to the first 3 years for years 4 and 5. So to directly answer your question, I do not believe when we update our 5-year capital plan, which we'll do on our next analyst call in early November, Beth, I believe, and then with much more details at the EEI finance conference. You're not going to see -- I would be stunned if you saw any kind of a decline in what is now years 4 and 5. It's just not going to happen, not going to happen, in particular, because of the strong investment opportunity that we have in front of us.
And what kind of buckets might we see? Well, clearly, there's going to be an additional emphasis on continuing to invest in renewables and battery storage, distribution upgrades, new customer connections, you name it. It will be across the board. But as you know, a very significant tailwind as we continue to execute our ESG progress plan, continue to reach those lofty environmental goals, those aggressive environmental goals. So again, I wouldn't put too much stock in looking at years 4 and 5 right now. Those buckets will definitely be filled up.
Scott, anything to add to that?"

We're really, frankly, not seeing a ton. I think, as we phrased it, really not a -- no significant impact so far. 
Now part of that is because of the way we deal with our infrastructure segment and the fact that we have set prices with developers that have very long history of being able to procure at very positive and constructive prices. So on the infrastructure side, we haven't really seen any significant impact at all.
On the regulated side, again, a lot of the projects that we have underway, procurement has already taken place, so not much at this stage of the game in terms of inflationary impact.
Where we have seen where we have seen some inflationary impact is actually in the natural gas commodity prices. Gosh, we were up over $4 per million Btu just the other day. So there, I think -- with the glut of natural gas a bit disappearing across the country, I think we're going to see some elevated natural gas prices, certainly for winter -- the upcoming winter. But that's where, in my opinion, we're seeing the first kind of signs.
And then in terms of the future, it's anybody's guess how sticky the inflation numbers are but one of the things that I always tend to look at for what it's worth. Remember, Milton Friedman said that inflation is, has been and always will be a monetary phenomenon. So one of the things, I think, that we look at is essentially the growth of the money supply. And if you look at the growth of the money supply, it's already begun to taper off a little bit. It's still up and up materially, but it's already begun to taper off a little bit. So that gives me some hope that while we probably, for the next year, will see some elevated inflation numbers, perhaps it's on its way to a more normal level."

But I would say if you look at our pipeline of potential projects, it is still very robust, and we're working with potential projects and developers that have long successful track records. We don't see, right now, any diminution of the kind of projects that we're interested in for our infrastructure segment or and more importantly, we're not seeing any significant diminution in returns.

I'm going to ask Scott to give you his view on this as well. Let me just say 2 quick things. I mean, essentially, with the retirement of older coal-fired units that has already taken place on our system, with the announced retirements that we've talked about already, really, there's very little coal-fired capacity left in our system after 2025.
Like you and others, we're asked about the new units at our Oak Creek site. Those new units, very efficient, among the most efficient thermal-fired power plants in the world. And I should remind everybody that what we need to do in looking at the future of those units is to separate the value of those units from the fuel source. And let me explain that.
The new Oak Creek units are ideally situated on the transmission grid in the Midwest. They are very important to reliability in the middle western part of the United States, not just Wisconsin. So we built those units. And remember, the first unit came online in 2010, the second in 2011. We built those units with some flexibility. In fact, I mean, there is natural gas into the site. It is possible, and we've done it several times to coal fire the units on coal and natural gas. And yes, it is possible -- technically possible for the units to be converted away from coal to natural gas at some point. In fact, we are taking a look at both from an engineering standpoint and a cost standpoint the feasibility of doing so.

And that is, as we look to retire additional capacity, we look, first and foremost, at older units that are less efficient.

We look at age, efficiency and whether or not it makes any sense from a capital investment standpoint to spend the dollars that would keep those units alive.
And of course, as I mentioned, the next units to be retired on our system would be the older Oak Creek units. They've been part of the Wisconsin retail rate base since 1960s. That's units 5, 6, 7 and 8 at our older Oak Creek site. And then we are a joint owner with Alliant for the Columbia Units 1 and 2.

Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2021. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher",930,"From America's heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2021. 
First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. 
I'm sure you saw the announcement last week that our Board of Directors has taken the next step in our long-term succession planning. Kevin has decided to devote more time to his grandchildren and water skiing bare foot on his favorite lakes. He'll be retiring in 2022. We're delighted that Scott will assume the role of President and Chief Executive on February 1. And finally, I've agreed to continue serving as Executive Chairman until our Annual Stockholders Meeting in 2024. 
Kevin and Scott, of course, have been instrumental in shaping our progress over many years. We wish Kevin all the best, and I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Scott as he takes on his new role. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $0.92 a share. Our results were significantly better than expected, driven by warmer-than-normal weather, continued economic recovery in our region and our focus on operating efficiency. 
Our balance sheet, our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. In just a moment, we'll update you on the details of our new 5-year ESG progress plan, a plan that will cover our investments in reliability and decarbonization over the period 2022 through 2026. 
As we've reported to you, we're well on our way to achieving some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generation fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction by 2025 and an 80% reduction by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Importantly, we have a road map to reach these goals without any major advances in technology. 
So today, we're announcing that our use of coal will continue to decline to a level that we expect will be immaterial by the end of 2030. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power we supply to customers. A number of you have also been asking when can we exit coal completely. Here's the answer. We believe we will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the year 2035. 
The next logical question is, what does this mean for the modern coal-fired units at our Oak Creek side? As you recall, these units were part of our Power of the Future plan and were completed only about a decade ago. While our modern units at Oak Creek will remain a key part of our fleet for many, many years to come. These power of the Future units rank as some of the most efficient in the country. Among the top 5% of all coal-fired plants in heat rate performance over the past decade. 
And they're strategically, as we've discussed, they are strategically located to support reliability of the Midwestern transmission grid. Fortunately, we can plan for the future of the new units at Oak Creek with fuel flexibility in mind. We've tested co-firing on natural gas at the site. So subject to the receipt of an environmental permit, we plan to make operating refinements over the next 2 years that will allow a fuel blend of up to 30% on natural gas. 
And then over time, we will be able to transition completely away from coal by making incremental investments in plant equipment. This would include, for example, new burners. And of course, we will need additional pipeline capacity reaching into the site. So we see a very bright and long future for the newer units at Oak Creek. 
And now let's take a look at the capital plan that will continue to shape a decarbonizing economy. For the period 2022 through 2026, we expect to invest $17.7 billion. Our focus remains on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This ESG progress plan is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $1.6 billion or nearly 10% above our previous 5-year plan. 
We expect this plan to support compound earnings growth of 6% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue new equity. We'll be increasing our investment in renewables and for our regulated utilities from 1,800 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 2,400 megawatts in this brand-new plan. These carbon-free assets include solar, wind and battery storage. 
We're also dedicating more capital to hardening our electric distribution networks so that we can maintain a superior level of reliability for our customers. And investments in our gas delivery systems and the development of renewable natural gas will support our goals for the gas distribution business as well. As a reminder, we're targeting net-zero methane emissions by 2030. 
So add it all up, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan. The projects that are driving our growth are low risk and highly executable and they're accelerating the transition to a clean energy future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and 15,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet. 
Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis, were up 2.5%. We continue to see economic rebound in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 3.5% from last year's third quarter. And on a weather-normal basis, they were up 4.2%. 
Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 3.8% from the third quarter of 2020. And on a weather-normal basis, were up 3.5%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were up 1%. This excludes gas used for power generation. And on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%. 
Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up. Turning now to our Infrastructure segment. Our new capital plan calls for the investment of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2026. Considering the 3 projects that are currently under development, we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion at that time frame. 
As a quick reminder, we have 8 wind projects, all with long-term off-takers, announced or in operation in our Infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investments. As previously discussed, our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year. And our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service in the first half of 2022. 
These time lines have been factored into our updated capital plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

For the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, we now are performing civil work and grading. Our target for completing that project is the end of 2022. That date will depend on module supply, which is uncertain as we await clarity on matters before the Department of Commerce. 
Now for a few regulatory updates. We expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission shortly on our plans to build 2 liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. This proposed investment would greatly enhance customer savings and reliability during Wisconsin's cold winters. Pending approval, we expect the facilities to enter service in late 2023. They are projected to save our We Energies customers approximately $200 million over time. 
We also have updates on the rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. The Illinois Commerce Commission unanimously approved the final order for our rate case at North Shore Gas. The order authorizes a rate increase of 4.5%, including an ROE of 9.67% and an equity ratio of 51.58%. New rates went into effect on September 15. And the Michigan Public Service Commission unanimously approved a settlement in our rate case for Michigan Gas Utilities. The settlement authorizes a rate increase of 6.35%, including an ROE of 9.85% and an equity ratio of 51.5%. 
New rates will be effective January 1. We have no other rate cases pending at this time. And as we look forward to the winter heating season ahead, I'm pleased to report that we're ready. We have our gas contracts in place and our gas inventories are at our targeted levels.

Our 2021 third quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from the strong economic recovery in our region, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency. 
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic and stronger weather normalized sales drove a $0.03 increase in earnings. 
Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the third quarter of 2020 and lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.04. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.02 of increased fuel costs related to higher natural gas prices. It's worth noting that we estimate weather was $0.05 favorable compared to normal in the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020. 
Overall, we added $0.05 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. Earnings increased $0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions. 
Finally, we saw a $0.01 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. This increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense. In summary, we improved on our third quarter 2020 performance by $0.08 per share. 
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021. 
Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $57 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 9 months of 2021 more than offset the higher working capital requirements. As expected, with normal collection practices underway in all of our service territories, we made great strides in improving our working capital position in the third quarter. 
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021, a $129 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utilities and energy infrastructure business. Looking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plans to invest $17.7 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7% annual growth in our asset base. 
Pages 18 and 19 of the earnings package provide more details of the breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here. As we continue to make our energy transition, nearly 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $5.4 billion in renewable investment and $6.8 billion in grid and fleet reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to support our strong customer growth. 
We also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our infrastructure to further generate long-term operating efficiency. With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next 5 years. 
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance. We're raising our earnings guidance again for 2021 to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. This is the second time we're raising our guidance. If you'll recall, our original guidance was $3.99 to $4.03 per share. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

And finally, a quick reminder about our dividend. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year at our scheduled meeting in early December. 
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Overall, we're on track focus on delivering and providing value for our customers and our stockholders. 
And operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call."

And Gale, I want to unpack sort of your comments around the Oak Creek power of the future units because I think that's sort of somewhat pretty material. Any estimate around capital cost to fully convert from coal to gas and what the heat rate of those units would be? 
I know the contracts are obviously tech agnostic, but with shifting also baseload units to essentially higher heat rate peakers have any kind of ramifications under the terms of the contracts with the unit service capacity? Or do you expect to run them all the time?"

Let me say one thing, though, I would not expect as we move through the transition at the New Old Creek units between now and 2035. I would not expect them to run simply as peakers. They're probably going to run much more like our Port Washington units, which are highly efficient combined cycle units. 
So I wouldn't make the conclusion that they'll run as peakers. They're very much going to be needed for reliability. No question about that. In terms of capital, I mentioned that would be incremental capital investments in the plan. And I'm going to have Scott give you the details. I can tell you, though, that after a lot of work and a lot of analysis, we still have more to do for the long run.

So because you're kind of looking on the roll forward, electric spend is up about $2 billion and the infrastructure and gas are down around $450 million. 
Is this kind of the broader and more sustainable strategic shift in growth focus going forward or just kind of a timing factor, especially as we're thinking about your plans beyond '25?"

Let me just say this, we always start with need. And our preference, obviously, is to invest in regulated assets where there is clearly a customer benefit or a customer need.

And our preference, obviously, is to invest in regulated assets where there is clearly a customer benefit or a customer need. So as we look at this plan, and you're right, the increase is material. But as we look at this plan compared to the prior 5-year plan. And again, largest 5-year capital plan in our history at $17.7 billion. 
The 2 things you mentioned are correct. First of all, we'll be adding a significant amount of renewables to maintain reliability as we retire older, less efficient coal-fired plants in this time frame. So the first is we have got to replace some of that capacity with carbon-free energy. So there's an increase in renewable investment, regulated renewable investment in the plan compared to the previous 5-year plan. 
And then -- and this is something that we've all talked about internally, and Kevin continues to point out and he's absolutely right. We have aging distribution infrastructure and that aging distribution infrastructure, which we've invested in, in the past. We're coming up to a period now where there is a much greater need to replace that aging distribution infrastructure. 
So those are the 2 drivers, if you will, of kind of the incremental change in this 5-year capital plan versus the prior 5-year capital plan. Does that respond to your question?"

So again, if I were a betting man, I would say that extensions of renewable tax credits will happen. And it looks like there's a strong possibility that what they call direct pay will occur. Now if direct pay is a part of the renewable package, if you will, in that plan, then that clearly enhances our opportunities. It's good for customers. It's good for cash flows. It's good for our -- the growth of our regulated business. It's good for the growth of our Infrastructure segment. 
So I think a key to watch is not only the 10-year extension that they're talking about of production tax credits also the flexibility on tax credits for solar but also a big key would be the direct pay. And that would be a strong positive and would also have a step back and look again at what is doable and what's needed here."

Let me give you a dollar amount and Scott can fill in some additional details. Depending upon we have natural gas, we're the natural gas provider in most of Wisconsin, Chicago, the northern suburbs of Chicago, portions of Western Michigan and in places all over Minnesota. Depending upon where you are in our service area, it looks like the average bill increase for a residential customer, given what we've been able to do to mitigate higher gas prices with our hedging and storage opportunities. 
So the typical residential customer will see about a $25 to $40 monthly increase for each month of the heating season based on what we're seeing today and what we've got locked in. And I can tell you that we have been very aggressive as always with our hedging strategies with gas storage, with option contracts, and we're pleased with how we've been able to mitigate the very sizable increase in the natural gas market for pricing.

It all comes back as we've talked this through with our operating people, with our technicians,  with our outside experts. It all comes back to the proper transition to continue aggressive CO2 reduction but maintaining reliability. And we're quite confident that by 2035, at the latest that we can adjust our fuel source at Oak Creek, such that coal will be a backup source. I mentioned to you that our view is that our use of coal for power supply for our customers will be almost immaterial in our planning by 2030, less than 5% of our total power supply. 
So we're going to work our way forward with continuing to increase the fuel blending at Oak Creek, making sure that we maintain that high standard of reliability, which we've got to have. But it really is a thought about how quickly can we go and maintain reliability in step increments. And that's our current view. 
So we'll see how it goes, but we're very confident about the trajectory between now and 2030. And if the trajectory is even better, then we'll see where we go. But it's really our best estimate of how to make continued progress on aggressive environmental goals and maintaining reliability."

We have Kevin Fletche",928,"From America's heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2021.  
First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, our President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Operating Officer; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.  
I'm sure you saw the announcement last week that our Board of Directors has taken the next step in our long-term succession planning. Kevin has decided to devote more time to his grandchildren and to water skiing barefoot on his favorite lakes. He'll be retiring in 2022. We're delighted that Scott will assume the role of President and Chief Executive on February 1. And finally, I've agreed to continue serving as Executive Chairman until our Annual Stockholders Meeting in 2024.    Kevin and Scott, of course, have been instrumental in shaping our progress over many years. We wish Kevin all the best, and I look forward to working hand-in-hand with Scott as he takes on his new role. 
Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $0.92 a share. Our results were significantly better than expected, driven by warmer-than-normal weather, continued economic recovery in our region and our focus on operating efficiency.  Our balance sheet, our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. In just a moment, we'll update you on the details of our new 5-year ESG progress plan, a plan that will cover our investments in reliability and decarbonization over the period 2022 through 2026.  
As we've reported to you, we're well on our way to achieving some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generation fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction by 2025 and an 80% reduction by 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. Importantly, we have a road map to reach these goals without any major advances in technology.  
So today, we're announcing that our use of coal will continue to decline to a level that we expect will be immaterial by the end of 2030. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal will account for less than 5% of the power we supply to customers. A number of you have also been asking when can we exit coal completely. Here's the answer. We believe we will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the year 2035.  
The next logical question is, what does this mean for the modern coal-fired units at our Oak Creek side? As you recall, these units were part of our Power the Future plan and were completed only about a decade ago. While our modern units at Oak Creek will remain a key part of our fleet for many, many years to come. These Power the Future units rank as some of the most efficient in the country. Among the top 5% of all coal-fired plants in heat rate performance over the past decade.  
And they're strategically, as we've discussed, they are strategically located to support reliability of the Midwestern transmission grid. Fortunately, we can plan for the future of the new units at Oak Creek with fuel flexibility in mind. We've tested coal-firing on natural gas at the site. So subject to the receipt of an environmental permit, we plan to make operating refinements over the next 2 years that will allow a fuel blend of up to 30% on natural gas.  
And then over time, we will be able to transition completely away from coal by making incremental investments in plant equipment. This would include, for example, new burners. And of course, we will need additional pipeline capacity reaching into the site. So we see a very bright and long future for the newer units at Oak Creek.  
And now let's take a look at the capital plan that will continue to shape a decarbonizing economy. For the period 2022 through 2026, we expect to invest $17.7 billion. Our focus remains on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This ESG progress plan is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $1.6 billion or nearly 10% above our previous 5-year plan.  We expect this plan to support compound earnings growth of 6% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue new equity. We'll be increasing our investment in renewables and for our regulated utilities from 1,800 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 2,400 megawatts in this brand-new plan. These carbon-free assets include solar, wind and battery storage.  
We're also dedicating more capital to hardening our electric distribution networks so that we can maintain a superior level of reliability for our customers. And investments in our gas delivery systems and the development of renewable natural gas will support our goals for the gas distribution business as well. As a reminder, we're targeting net-zero methane emissions by 2030.  So add it all up, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan. The projects that are driving our growth are low risk and highly executable and they're accelerating the transition to a clean energy future.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our sales results for the quarter as well as an update on our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours."

At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers and 15,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis beginning on Page 13 of the earnings packet.  
Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.4% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis, were up 2.5%. We continue to see economic rebound in our service territory. For example, small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 3.5% from last year's third quarter and on a weather-normal basis, they were up 4.2%.  Meanwhile, large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 3.8% from the third quarter of 2020 and on a weather-normal basis, were up 3.5%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were up 1%. This excludes gas used for power generation and on a weather-normal basis, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2.5%.  Overall, our growth continues to track ahead of our forecast as the economy continues to open up. 
Turning now to our Infrastructure segment. Our new capital plan calls for the investment of $1.9 billion between 2022 and 2026. Considering the 3 projects that are currently under development, we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion at that time frame.  As a quick reminder, we have 8 wind projects, all with long-term off-takers, announced to an operation in our Infrastructure segment. This represents approximately $2.3 billion of investments. As previously discussed, our Jayhawk Wind Farm is projected to go in service by early next year. And our Thunderhead Wind investment is projected to go in service in the first half of 2022.  
These time lines have been factored into our updated capital plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on our utility operations."

I'm pleased to report that our Badger Hollow I solar project is just weeks away from completion. You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. For the next phase of the project, Badger Hollow II, we now are performing civil work and grading. Our target for completing that project is the end of 2022. That date will depend on module supply, which is uncertain as we await clarity on matters before the Department of Commerce.  
Now for a few regulatory updates. We expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission shortly on our plans to build 2 liquefied natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. This proposed investment would greatly enhance customer savings and reliability during Wisconsin's cold winters. Pending approval, we expect the facilities to enter service in late 2023. They are projected to save our We Energies customers approximately $200 million over time.  
We also have updates on the rate reviews at 2 of our smaller utilities. The Illinois Commerce Commission unanimously approved the final order for our rate case at North Shore Gas. The order authorizes a rate increase of 4.5%, including an ROE of 9.67% and an equity ratio of 51.58%. New rates went into effect on September 15. And the Michigan Public Service Commission unanimously approved a settlement in our rate case for Michigan Gas Utilities. The settlement authorizes a rate increase of 6.35%, including an ROE of 9.85% and an equity ratio of 51.5%.  
New rates will be effective January 1. We have no other rate cases pending at this time. And as we look forward to the winter heating season ahead, I'm pleased to report that we're ready. We have our gas contracts in place and our gas inventories are at our targeted levels.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Xia."

Our 2021 third quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020. Our favorable results were largely driven by higher earnings from our utility operations. Our regulated utilities benefited from the strong economic recovery in our region, continued execution of our capital plan and our focus on operating efficiency.  
The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2020. First, continued economic recovery from the pandemic and stronger weather normalized sales drove a $0.03 increase in earnings.  
Also, rate relief and additional capital investment added $0.04 compared to the third quarter of 2020 and lower day-to-day O&M contributed $0.04. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.02 of increased fuel costs related to higher natural gas prices. It's worth noting that we estimate weather was $0.05 favorable compared to normal in the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020.  
Overall, we added $0.05 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations. Moving on to our investment in American Transmission Company. Earnings increased $0.01 compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.01 in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. This was driven by production tax credits related to wind farm acquisitions.  Finally, we saw a $0.01 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. This increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense. In summary, we improved on our third quarter 2020 performance by $0.08 per share.  
Now I'd like to update you on some other financial items. For the full year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. Excluding the benefit of unprotected taxes flowing to customers, we project our 2021 effective tax rate will be between 19% and 20%. As in past years, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2021.  Our projections show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our current capital plan. 
Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $57 million. Our increase in cash earnings in the first 9 months of 2021 more than offset the higher working capital requirements. As expected, with normal collection practices underway in all of our service territories, we made great strides in improving our working capital position in the third quarter.  
Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021, a $129 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2020. This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utilities and energy infrastructure business. Looking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plans to invest $17.7 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7% annual growth in our asset base.  Pages 18 and 19 of the earnings package provide more details of the breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here. 
As we continue to make our energy transition, nearly 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $5.4 billion in renewable investment and $6.8 billion in grid and fleet reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to support our strong customer growth. We also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our infrastructure to further generate long-term operating efficiency. With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next 5 years.  
In closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance. We're raising our earnings guidance again for 2021 to a range of $4.05 to $4.07 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. This is the second time we're raising our guidance. If you'll recall, our original guidance was $3.99 to $4.03 per share.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Gale."

We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.

So I wouldn't make the conclusion that they'll run as peakers. They're very much going to be needed for reliability, no question about that.

But as we look at this plan compared to the prior 5-year plan and again, largest 5-year capital plan in our history at $17.7 billion.  The 2 things you mentioned are correct. 
First of all, we'll be adding a significant amount of renewables to maintain reliability as we retire older, less efficient coal-fired plants in this time frame. So the first is we have got to replace some of that capacity with carbon-free energy. So there's an increase in renewable investment, regulated renewable investment in the plan compared to the previous 5-year plan.  And then -- and this is something that we've all talked about internally, and Kevin continues to point out and he's absolutely right. We have aging distribution infrastructure and that aging distribution infrastructure, which we've invested in, in the past, we're coming up to a period now where there is a much greater need to replace that aging distribution infrastructure.  So those are the 2 drivers, if you will, of kind of the incremental change in this 5-year capital plan versus the prior 5-year capital plan. Does that respond to your question?"

It's such a sausage-making machine in Washington, as you know. But if I were a betting man, I think something will pass, and it appears, as you've seen, Steve, that there's strong support for the renewable tax credit portion of that build back better plan. And that seems to have stuck in every single version or every single iteration of the plan. 
So again, if I were a betting man, I would say that extensions of renewable tax credits will happen. And it looks like there's a strong possibility that what they call direct pay will occur. Now if direct pay is a part of the renewable package, if you will, in that plan, then that clearly enhances our opportunities. It's good for customers. It's good for cash flows. It's good for our -- the growth of our regulated business. It's good for the growth of our Infrastructure segment. 
So I think a key to watch is not only the 10-year extension that they're talking about of production tax credits, also the flexibility on tax credits for solar but also a big key would be the direct pay. And that would be a strong positive and would also have a step back and look again at what is doable and what's needed here."

It all comes back to the proper transition to continue aggressive CO2 reduction but maintaining reliability. And we're quite confident that by 2035, at the latest that we can adjust our fuel source at Oak Creek, such that coal will be a backup source. I mentioned to you that our view is that our use of coal for power supply for our customers will be almost immaterial in our planning by 2030, less than 5% of our total power supply. 
So we're going to work our way forward with continuing to increase the fuel blending at Oak Creek, making sure that we maintain that high standard of reliability, which we've got to have. But it really is a thought about how quickly can we go and maintain reliability in step increments and that's our current view. 
So we'll see how it goes, but we're very confident about the trajectory between now and 2030. And if the trajectory is even better, then we'll see where we go. But it's really our best estimate of how to make continued progress on aggressive environmental goals and maintaining reliability."
