Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow and executed on our cost-out programs while navigating the impacts of the global pandemic and industry",1760,"Thank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow and executed on our cost-out programs while navigating the impacts of the global pandemic and industry downturn. During the quarter, OFS and DS executed well on commercial opportunities and cost-out initiatives, while TPS delivered solid orders and operating income. Despite an incredibly challenging year for Baker Hughes in the industry in 2020, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow, booked $6.4 billion in TPS orders and executed on our substantial cost-out and restructuring program. We also took several important steps to accelerate our strategy and invest in new energy transition technologies, helping to position the company for the future. I cannot thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication to achieve our goals and move the company forward over what has been a trying year for everyone. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we are cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will begin to recover from the impact of the global pandemic. Assuming a successful rollout of vaccines around the world, a synchronized global recovery should help drive solid growth in oil demand over the next 12 to 18 months and support a meaningful reduction in excess capacity over that time period. We believe this macro environment likely translates into a somewhat tepid investment environment for oil and gas companies during the first half of 2021. However, we expect spending and activity levels to gain momentum over the course of the year as the macro environment improves, likely setting up the industry for stronger growth in 2022. 
In the natural gas and LNG markets, 2020 proved to be a more resilient year for demand, primarily due to growth in China and accelerated coal-to-gas switching across several countries. LNG demand growth is estimated to have held firm versus 2019 levels and fared much better than other commodities that saw meaningful declines. We believe this resiliency highlights the structural demand growth for LNG and reaffirms our positive long-term view for natural gas as a transition and destination fuel for broader energy consumption. 
Regardless of the state of short-term macro environment, Baker Hughes remains focused on executing the 3 pillars of our strategy: to transform the core, invest for growth and position for new frontiers. Our efforts to transform the core are the most visible and immediate components of our strategy. We delivered over $700 million of annualized cost savings in 2020, and we will continue to optimize our processes and infrastructure in order to deliver further cost reductions and footprint consolidation in 2021. 
On the second pillar of investing for growth, we continue to identify opportunities to expand in the industrial sector and increase our condition monitoring and asset management offerings. We recently won awards in our DS segment that encompass our full suite of industrial asset management and digital capabilities. And we are having promising discussions for future awards in both the oil and gas and industrial sectors. We also continue to see good traction with our nonmetallic offerings, where we broke ground on our facility in Saudi Arabia with our partner, Saudi Aramco, and will soon be completing our new facility in Houston. 
On the third pillar of positioning for new frontiers, we continue to evaluate multiple concepts and business models across the CCUS, hydrogen and energy storage value chains. We see several opportunities to deploy our existing technologies or add to our offering through targeted investments and bolt-on acquisitions. In CCUS, we acquired compact carbon capture or 3C in November. 3C is an early stage carbon capture technology that offers a 75% smaller footprint and lower CapEx requirements compared to what is available today. In hydrogen, we are seeing positive momentum with our product offerings and remain engaged with several customers across a wide range of industries to advance their hydrogen projects. As we execute on these 3 strategic pillars and our broader evolution as an energy technology company, we are committed to operating in a disciplined manner that prioritizes free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital. 
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In our Oilfield Services business, activity has stabilized globally, with modest improvements in select areas and positive signs for further improvement across multiple regions over the course of 2021. In the international markets, the decline in fourth quarter activity was mostly in line with our expectations, aside from some additional softness in the Middle East that developed late in the year. For 2021, our view remains largely intact with a modest recovery in the second half across several low-cost basins. Looking across different geographies, we expect a solid recovery to continue in Latin America off the pressure levels, modest improvement in the North Sea and Russia and the potential for a modest second half recovery in the Middle East. 
In North America, a solid year-end improvement in drilling and completion activity outweighed typical fourth quarter seasonality. Looking into 2021, we expect further improvements in drilling activity over the first half of the year as public EMPs begin to add back rigs. Although the rig count is moving higher, we believe that the commitment towards capital discipline and maintenance mode spending remains intact. While we are pleased to see that the outlook for OFS is gradually improving, our primary focus remains on increasing the margin and return profile of this business through improved operating efficiency and portfolio actions. 
During 2020, we executed on our cost-out actions in OFS and continue to work through multiple work streams to further reduce our cost structure. This includes a plan to reduce our rooftops by over 100 facilities in 2021 and shut down completions-related operations in select countries in Latin America and Africa. Overall, we believe that OFS operating margins remain on track to reach double digits in the coming years, following the significant structural cost reductions in 2020 and as we institutionalize both promote operations and better operating processes. 
Moving to TPS. Our focus remains on executing the significant backlog of LNG projects awarded in recent years, continuing to grow our aftermarket services offering, driving growth in our valves business and capitalizing on attractive opportunities in the new energy space. During the quarter, we booked an additional award for power generation for the North Field East LNG project in Qatar. This follows the main refrigerant compression awards we booked in the third quarter. 
For the LNG market overall, our long-term outlook for demand growth remains intact. The recent increase in LNG spot prices has solidified a similar view for many of our customers and improved momentum for a number of projects. As a result, we continue to expect that 3 to 4 projects are likely to move forward in 2021, followed by a robust pipeline of LNG projects that we expect to reach FID beyond 2021. 
In our Pipeline and Gas Processing segment, we secured an award with South Gas company in Iraq for the design, manufacture and construction of an integrated natural gas processing and production facility. An important part of this project is the supply of compression equipment and digital monitoring systems that will enable the reuse of previously flared natural gas, which is estimated to reduce Iraq's carbon emissions by roughly 6 million tons annually. This award highlights our broad capabilities as we seek to deliver a diverse range of decarbonization solutions for our customers. 
For TPS, we are optimistic about the outlook for recovery in 2021 and 2022 after a difficult year in 2020 as customers resume spending to maintain and, in some instances, upgrade their equipment. While our contractual services business has remained resilient through the recent market turbulence, we expect growth to be led by a recovery in transactional services and upgrades, areas that were particularly impacted during the pandemic. On a long-term basis, we are excited by recent traction for upgrade opportunities as customers look to decarbonize and improve the efficiency of their equipment. 
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we executed on our cost-out efforts and have taken several portfolio actions over the course of 2020. We continue to focus on rightsizing the business and optimizing the portfolio in the face of a challenging offshore market environment. In the fourth quarter, we won an order from ENI for the Agogo field in Angola. The project includes several solutions from our subsea Connect suite of technologies, including multiple subsea trees, wellheads and manifolds. With Brent prices returning to the 50s and more optimistic view for oil demand over the next few years, we see the outlook for industry subsea tree awards improving modestly in 2021, though still well below 2019 levels. As we look out longer term, we believe that deepwater activity will be increasingly dominated by low-cost basins and that it will be difficult to sustain 2019 industry order levels for the foreseeable future. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, the oil and gas and aerospace end markets remain challenging. However, we have seen some recovery in industrial end markets outside of aerospace in line with the rebound in the global economy. In the fourth quarter, we were awarded several projects that demonstrate our capabilities in industrial asset management. We secured an extension to a previously awarded project with Petrobras. We will provide a suite of digital solutions and services to optimize productivity, reduce operational and safety risk and lower carbon emissions across Petrobras sites. Our Bently Nevada business secured a contract with a major hydroelectric operator in the U.S. to provide Orbit 60 System 1 software and a 5-year services agreement for industrial asset management across multiple dams. Bently Nevada also secured a fleet-wide contract with the American Energy Power to deploy System 1 software, remote monitoring and analytical services to diagnose machinery issues in real time. These wins are an example of our deep domain expertise in industrial asset management. Going forward, we see significant opportunities to apply these capabilities in the oil and gas sector and we believe that these core competencies are also applicable to a number of industrial sectors. 
Overall, we executed well in 2020 against the challenge of the global pandemic and the industry downturn, delivering strong free cash flow and executing on our cost-out programs. Baker Hughes is well placed to navigate the current market environment and position to lead the energy transition. We remain focused on executing for customers, being disciplined on cost and delivering for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.2 billion, up 2% sequentially, driven by OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by declines in OFS and TPS. Year-over-ye",2166,"Thanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.2 billion, up 2% sequentially, driven by OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by declines in OFS and TPS. Year-over-year, orders were down 25%, with declines in all 4 segments. Remaining performance obligation was $23.4 billion, up 2% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $8 billion, down 3% sequentially, and services RPO ended at $15.4 billion, up 5% sequentially. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.9, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9. 
Revenue for the quarter was $5.5 billion, up 9% sequentially, driven by TPS and Digital Solutions, partially offset by low single-digit declines in OFS and OFE. Year-over-year, revenue was down 13%, driven by declines in OFS, OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by an increase in TPS. Operating income for the quarter was $182 million. Adjusted operating income was $462 million, which excludes $281 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 98% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 8.4%, up 380 basis points sequentially. We are particularly pleased with the margin improvement in the fourth quarter, which was largely driven by strong execution on our restructuring actions and improvements in operating productivity. Corporate costs were $111 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat with fourth quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $307 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect D&A to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels and gradually decline through the year. 
Income tax expense in the quarter was $568 million, driven by our geographic mix of earnings, a valuation allowance tax expense of $225 million and a $91 million tax expense related to business dispositions. Although we expect our book tax rate to remain elevated in 2021, we expect our cash taxes to decline. 
Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.91. Included in diluted GAAP earnings per share is a $1.4 billion gain on our investment in C3.ai recorded in other nonoperating income. We invested $69 million in C3.ai when we formed our partnership in June 2019. In December, C3 completed its IPO, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Since our C3 investment is recorded as marketable security on our balance sheet, the change in fair value will be reflected in the other nonoperating income line on a quarterly basis going forward. While we are very pleased with our investment, we are equally as pleased with our strong partnership with C3 as we develop and market new AI solutions for the oil and gas industry. We also view our unique C3 partnership as a good example of our capital allocation philosophy as we invest in new technology frontiers and energy transition. 
Adjusted loss per share was $0.07. Included in adjusted loss per share are the valuation allowance tax expenses mentioned earlier. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $250 million. This was driven by an improvement in sequential operating results and modestly lower net CapEx. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter includes $189 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. For the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially primarily due to seasonality. 
When I look at the total year 2020, I am pleased with our financial results, considering the disruptions in the global economy, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant restructuring that we executed over the year and the number of corporate transactions that we completed. Orders of $20.7 billion for the full year were down 23% in 2020, driven by declines in all segments. Total company book-to-bill was 1 in the year. Total year revenue of $20.7 billion was down 13%. OFS was down 21% and DS declined 19%, partially offset by an increase of 3% in TPS. Adjusted operating income of $1 billion was down 35% in the year, with total company adjusted operating income margins declining 170 basis points, mostly driven by volume declines in OFS and DS. Corporate costs for the year were $464 million. For 2021, we expect corporate expenses to decline versus 2020. Our cost-out efforts and lower separation costs should lead to a gradual reduction in quarterly corporate expenses over the course of the year. 
During 2020, we exceeded our goal of $700 million in annualized cost savings, with the majority coming out in the second half of the year. And the average cash payback of our restructuring actions has been less than 1 year. In addition to restructuring, we completed the sale of 3 businesses in 2020, including SPC flow in the fourth quarter. These dispositions are in line with our strategy to exit businesses that do not meet our return requirements and are aligned with our broader portfolio evolution objectives. Overall, we believe that the actions taken in 2020 have greatly improved our global operations and helped to lay the groundwork for further improvement in our margin and return profile in the coming years. 
For the full year, we generated $518 million of free cash flow. We are pleased with our performance as our capital discipline, cost-out initiatives and working capital release helped to offset lower operating results and $670 million in cash restructuring and separation costs incurred during the year. In order to achieve some of our cost-out initiatives in 2021, we booked restructuring and impairment charges of $256 million in the fourth quarter, with an expected cash payback of less than 1 year. Following our cost rationalization actions in 2020, this next phase is primarily associated with optimizing our structural cost, most notably reducing our facilities footprint to align with our broader business transformation objectives. For 2021, we expect free cash flow to improve significantly versus 2020 and to approach historical levels, largely driven by higher operating income, modestly lower CapEx and significantly lower restructuring and separation cash expenditures. 
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter to close out a challenging year in the market. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, down 1% sequentially. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, led by declines in Asia Pacific, the North Sea and the Middle East. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially due to solid growth in both the North American land and the offshore markets. 
Operating income in the quarter was $142 million, a 53% increase sequentially and a 220 basis point improvement in margin rate. The improvement in margin was driven by restructuring and cost-out initiatives as well as favorable product mix. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see typical seasonal softness during the quarter, even though international drilling activity has largely stabilized. As a result, we expect our first quarter international revenue to decline modestly on a sequential basis. 
In North America, we expect the recent momentum in drilling and completion activity in the U.S. land segment to continue into the first half of 2021 as operators refresh spending budgets. As a result, we expect a modest sequential increase in North American OFS revenues. 
Although we should benefit from our cost-out initiatives, margin rates may decline modestly in the first quarter due to international seasonality and fewer product sales. For the full year 2021, our expectations are largely in line with the view we shared in October on our third quarter earnings call. 
Internationally, we expect activity levels to stabilize and remain relatively unchanged for the first half of 2021. We currently anticipate a second half recovery in activity across multiple regions. However, we still expect that our international revenue will be down in the mid single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. 
The recent increase in commodity prices and the redeployment of budgets have improved the near-term outlook in North America. At the moment, though, activity in the back half of the year remains less clear. As a result, we believe that drilling and completion activity in North America is also likely to be down in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Although OFS revenue will likely be down modestly for the full year, we believe that our cost-out action should still translate to a strong improvement in OFS margin in 2021. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $561 million, down 49% year-over-year and up 30% sequentially. The sequential improvement in orders was driven by the ENI Agogo award and a strong performance by our SPC project segment, specifically in the Middle East, which helped offset a sequential decline in flexibles orders. Revenue was $712 million, down 7% year-over-year. Revenue declines in subsea services and subsea drilling systems were offset by growth in SPS and flexibles. 
Operating income was $23 million, a 47% improvement year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume in SPS and flexibles, along with help from our cost-out program, which was partially offset by softness in services activity. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating income to also decline sequentially but remain in positive territory, primarily based on our cost-out initiatives. 
For the full year 2021, we expect the offshore markets to remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a difficult offshore environment in 2021. Although revenue is likely to be down in 2021, our goal is to maintain positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should offset the decline in volume. 
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Equipment orders were down 10% year-over-year. We were pleased with another solid quarter of bookings for TPS despite the challenging environment. Orders this quarter were supported by awards for the Iraq flare gas project and power generation units for Qatar Petroleum's NFE project. 
Service orders in the quarter were up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in contractual services. Revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 19% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up 67% as we continue to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was down 11% versus the prior year. 
Operating income for TPS was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and strong execution on cost productivity. Operating margin was 17.1%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by a higher mix of equipment revenue. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to decline sequentially, roughly in line with the last couple of years. Based on this revenue outlook, we expect TPS operating income to grow year-over-year, but expect margin rates to be roughly flat versus the first quarter of 2020 due to a higher mix of equipment revenue. 
For the full year 2021, we expect to generate solid year-over-year revenue growth driven by the conversion of our current equipment backlog and a modest increase in TPS service revenues. Although a higher mix of equipment revenue may be a slight headwind for growth in margin rates next year, we still expect solid growth in operating income based on higher volume. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $528 million, down 18% year-over-year. We saw declines in orders across most end markets, most notably transportation, oil and gas, and industrial. Sequentially, orders were up 7%, driven by seasonality in power and some improvements in transportation. 
Revenue for the quarter was $556 million, down 16% year-over-year due to lower volumes across all DS product lines, with the largest declines in Waygate and Reuter-Stokes. Sequentially, revenue was up 10% as some industrial end markets begin to recover. Operating income for the quarter was $76 million, down 30% year-over-year, driven by lower volume.  Sequentially, operating income was up 66%, driven by higher volume across all product lines and cost productivity. For the first quarter, we expect to see sequential revenue declines in line with typical seasonality and operating margin rates back into the single digits. 
Looking into 2021, we expect a modest increase in revenue on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With higher volumes and the benefit of our cost-out program, we believe DS margin rates can get back to low double digits for the full year. 
Overall, I am pleased with the execution in the fourth quarter and the total year amid a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. While 2021 have some challenges, we are confident in our strategy and our ability to execute. We remain focused on free cash flow and improving margins and financial returns. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

It looks like good momentum into '21. So lots of moving pieces between '21 versus '20. Brian touched on it in his comments. So core operational cash flow should improve. We're going to lap the severance and restructuring charges but working capital progress payment tailwinds don't likely recur. CapEx should be pretty restrained. Cash taxes probably helped a little bit. So all in, dividend coverage shouldn't be an issue. Is there any reason why we shouldn't translate that into free cash flow north of $1 billion in '21?"

I did say earlier, I would expect free cash flow to get back to historical levels, sort of the '18, '19 level. And you hit on a couple. Based on how we're seeing things play out right now, should see higher earnings, as you mentioned. CapEx specifically, I would expect a modest decline versus what we saw in 2020, assuming similar activity levels and what we're seeing right now. Working capital, specifically, based on what I'm seeing now, Sean, I'd say, should be neutral or a modest source of cash in '21. And I think it really depends on OFS activity levels and how progress payments play out from new orders in Turbo and OFE. As I also mentioned, while we expect earnings to be higher, do expect cash taxes to decline as we expect some refunds to come in, in 2021. So that should be a tailwind, as you mentioned. And look, the largest change is really the cash restructuring and separation charges, which will reduce material in 2021. So overall, that increase in earnings, the upside from cash restructuring should support material improvement. Feel good about the process improvements we've made. The teams are all over this. It's a key metric and in all of our performance metrics and are pleased with the performance there and have got a pretty good construct for '21."

We're off about 25% year-on-year in '20, not a surprise given the pandemic, and 2019 was quite strong. This is a very common debate today among investors, the trajectory of awards for this business, particularly as LNG sentiment has soured of late and hydrogen expectations have gone hyperbolic. So can we just talk about your expectations for keeping your book-to-bill at or above 1x in '21 and beyond? I'm thinking about just kind of buildup of awards in the next few years. You've got kind of a base of service awards. You've got line of sight of equipment awards going to be in downstream and then smaller versus larger LNG opportunities."

So again, conversations with customers, given the current pricing, have continued to be positive. And as you look at it from a demand perspective, we continue to believe LNG demand increases as we go forward. Outside of LNG equipment, the opportunity set for 2021 seems roughly the same as what we saw in 2020. There could be some mix movement between onshore, offshore and valves and other areas. But the opportunity is roughly the same. And as you said, we are seeing increased traction on CCUS as well as hydrogen. And with the continuing theme of the energy transition, a lot of customer discussions. On services, we're optimistic about the outlook for '21 and '22 as customers resume their maintenance activity and also with the opportunity to continue to focus on upgrades of their equipment. So we think TPS services has been underappreciated in the decarbonization theme and there's potential there for increase in '21, '22. So again, overall, '21, '22, roughly similar to 2020."

And that's also one of the key reasons why we acquired in November, 3C Compact Carbon Capture, because we see the opportunity of the smaller footprint equipment being very useful there. As you look at it, the IEA already says that there's going to be an increased requirement of carbon capture and from 40 million tons today up to 750 million tons by 2030 and then also to 2.4 billion tons by 2050. So hard to give you a precise number. But clearly, it's an important part of the portfolio as it continues to grow, and we expect to see orders coming through in the next 1 to 3 years. And I would agree with you, it is the area that probably first moves and then followed by hydrogen and others, but it's clearly something that customers are looking at already."

And as we mentioned, we expect activity levels to stabilize and remain relatively unchanged to the first half of '21.

That framework, obviously, is based on our current thinking that there's no material impact from the virus ongoing and lockdowns are maintained to a minimum, which obviously would impact that framework, if it changes. But looking at the geographies, we expect a solid recovery to continue in Latin America after depressed levels. Also some modest improvement in the North Sea and Russia. And also in the Middle East, a potential second half recovery as things start to improve there. On the offshore markets, similarly mixed, some improvement in areas like Brazil and Norway but also as we look at some stagnant to areas in West Africa. So as we look at international, I think we still expect that our international revenue will be down in the mid- to single-digit range on a year-over-year basis with an uplift in the second half. 2020 are likely to be a stronger year, just given the macro assumptions that we're seeing. 2022 is -- sorry."

I mean, first, the team has done, I think, a great job in terms of responding to the environment. And really realizing the benefits of multiple years of work to transform the business in the way it operates. And specifically around the first quarter, as I mentioned, margin rate could be down slightly based on seasonality and lower product sales. But the decline in volume and mix should be partially offset by the cost-out benefits that we've already seen come through that will carry over as well as additional cost benefits that will come through in the first quarter. And then beyond the first quarter, I'm feeling good about the margin accretion that we should see as volume recover seasonally in the second quarter, and then with any back half recovery and activity. So you've got all the restructuring efforts that have started to show benefits, and you see that in the margin rate here in the fourth quarter. And you've got the incremental benefits that will be coming through as we continue to execute on the programs that we just announced. And if I think about the exit rate and how to think about the business performance here, assuming there's no unexpected change in product or geographic mix, Angie, we should be in the high single digits by fourth quarter with a shot at reaching double digits depending on volume and and I think the team has shown that they've been executing and having some upside in these restructuring programs. So I think that's a tailwind for how to think about OFS and feel good about the margin trajectory."

You mentioned that previously. But if we look at the model, I think 2020 service revenues are about $400 million below kind of 2019 levels.

And as we look at beyond 2021, again, we see a number of projects solidifying going out. If you look at it from a longer-term perspective, by 2030, we still need to have capacity of approximately 650 million to 700 million tons of LNG in place.

And Chase, specifically around services as it relates to LNG, I'd remind you that the overwhelming majority of LNG services are on these contractual services agreements. And that revenue has pretty much played out as we expected it to play out this year. So the LNG service isn't really impacted as much by some of the shorter-term and in-year dynamics that you see in other parts of the portfolio. I will say, though, longer term, for LNG service and CSAs, as we're booking these new orders and things start to come online, you will see more contractual service agreements come into the RPO and you did see RPO grow in the quarter, and that's really on the back of CSAs and LNG, as I said, the overwhelming majority sign up for these long-term service agreements. Taking a step back, though, and looking at overall TPS services and and how I think about getting back to the 2019 baseline, I give it a wide time frame, maybe over the next 2 to 3 years. As I said, CSA revenue has been pretty resilient. And we've got good visibility there, giving the nature of those contracts and how we operate those. Transactional services should see some recovery as customers really stopped delaying maintenance activity and it -- deciding when it normalizes back to 2019 levels, it's difficult, but we do expect some tailwinds this year based on what we're hearing from customers. And I'd say, Chase, that probably the most difficult bucket of revenue to predict is upgrades, which is truly discretionary in nature and is usually one of the first items that operators cut. So I'd say if budget constraints remain in place, it could take upgrades a little while to get back to 2019 levels. Again, we are seeing customers talk about upgrades for various reasons, performance, better cost positioning and then also some of the carbon capture areas that Lorenzo mentioned. So that's why I'd say the visibility is a bit less clear in that area and why I'd say about 2 to 3 years on getting back to '19 levels."

As we've talked about on earlier calls, we are in hydrogen today and have been in hydrogen for decades. Basically, elementary uses for hydrogen and our compression technology. So we're starting to see discussions there with customers. The same thing on the the energy storage front.

And it's currently the pilot stage. And it was incubated with some key partners, including Equinor, and we believe that we can accelerate that technology and commercialize it. And look, we think the differentiation is important versus traditional carbon capture that Lorenzo had talked about. I mean, our technology now uses rotating beds versus static columns, solvents are distributed in a compact and modularized format. And so that combination allows us to have a 75% reduction in footprint, leading to lower CapEx and lower OpEx solutions. So again, our manufacturing know-how, our technology know-how with this new technology that was developed, I think, is what's going to help us become a leader or continue to be a leader in this space. And combine that with our turbomachinery business and what we have to offer there, with all the things that come in from Digital Solutions, we think we already have a very powerful offering in this space and can start to show some progress with our customers.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow and executed on our cost-out programs while navigating the impacts of the global pandemic and industry",1763,"Thank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow and executed on our cost-out programs while navigating the impacts of the global pandemic and industry downturn. During the quarter, OFS and DS executed well on commercial opportunities and cost-out initiatives, while TPS delivered solid orders and operating income. 
Despite an incredibly challenging year for Baker Hughes and the industry in 2020, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow, booked $6.4 billion in TPS orders and executed on our substantial cost-out and restructuring program. We also took several important steps to accelerate our strategy and invest in new energy transition technologies, helping to position the company for the future. I cannot thank our employees enough for their hard work and dedication to achieve our goals and move the company forward over what has been a trying year for everyone.
As we look ahead to 2021, we are cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will begin to recover from the impact of the global pandemic. Assuming a successful rollout of vaccines around the world, a synchronized global recovery should help drive solid growth in oil demand over the next 12 to 18 months and support a meaningful reduction in excess capacity over that time period. We believe this macro environment likely translates into a somewhat tepid investment environment for oil and gas companies during the first half of 2021. However, we expect spending and activity levels to gain momentum over the course of the year as the macro environment improves, likely setting up the industry for stronger growth in 2022.
In the natural gas and LNG market, 2020 proved to be a more resilient year for demand, primarily due to growth in China and accelerated coal-to-gas switching across several countries. LNG demand growth is estimated to have held firm versus 2019 levels and fared much better than other commodities that saw meaningful declines. We believe this resiliency highlights the structural demand growth for LNG and reaffirms our positive long-term view for natural gas as a transition and destination fuel for broader energy consumption.
Regardless of the state of short-term macro environment, Baker Hughes remains focused on executing the 3 pillars of our strategy: to transform the core, invest for growth and position for new frontiers. Our efforts to transform the core are the most visible and immediate components of our strategy. We delivered over $700 million of annualized cost savings in 2020, and we will continue to optimize our processes and infrastructure in order to deliver further cost reductions and footprint consolidation in 2021.
On the second pillar of investing for growth, we continue to identify opportunities to expand in the industrial sector and increase our condition monitoring and asset management offerings. We recently won awards in our DS segment that encompass our full suite of industrial asset management and digital capabilities. And we are having promising discussions for future awards in both the oil and gas and industrial sectors. We also continue to see good traction with our nonmetallic offerings, where we broke ground on our facility in Saudi Arabia with our partner, Saudi Aramco, and will soon be completing our new facility in Houston.
On the third pillar of positioning for new frontiers, we continue to evaluate multiple concepts and business models across the CCUS, hydrogen and energy storage value chains. We see several opportunities to deploy our existing technologies or add to our offering through targeted investments and bolt-on acquisitions. 
In CCUS, we acquired Compact Carbon Capture or 3C in November. 3C is an early-stage carbon capture technology that offers a 75% smaller footprint and lower CapEx requirements compared to what is available today. In hydrogen, we are seeing positive momentum with our product offerings and remain engaged with several customers across a wide range of industries to advance their hydrogen projects. As we execute on these 3 strategic pillars and our broader evolution as an energy technology company, we are committed to operating in a disciplined manner that prioritizes free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital.
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In our Oilfield Services business, activity has stabilized globally, with modest improvements in select areas and positive signs for further improvement across multiple regions over the course of 2021. In the international markets, the decline in fourth quarter activity was mostly in line with our expectations, aside from some additional softness in the Middle East that developed late in the year. 
For 2021, our view remains largely intact with a modest recovery in the second half across several low-cost basins. Looking across different geographies, we expect the solid recovery to continue in Latin America off depressed levels, modest improvement in the North Sea and Russia and the potential for a modest second half recovery in the Middle East.
In North America, a solid year-end improvement in drilling and completion activity outweighed typical fourth quarter seasonality. Looking into 2021, we expect further improvements in drilling activity over the first half of the year as public E&Ps begin to add back rigs. Although the rig count is moving higher, we believe that the commitment towards capital discipline and maintenance mode spending remains intact. 
While we are pleased to see that the outlook for OFS is gradually improving, our primary focus remains on increasing the margin and return profile of this business through improved operating efficiency and portfolio actions. During 2020, we executed on our cost-out actions in OFS and continue to work through multiple work streams to further reduce our cost structure. This includes a plan to reduce our rooftops by over 100 facilities in 2021 and shut down completions-related operations in select countries in Latin America and Africa. Overall, we believe that OFS operating margins remain on track to reach double digits in the coming years, following the significant structural cost reductions in 2020 and as we institutionalize both remote operations and better operating processes.
Moving to TPS. Our focus remains on executing the significant backlog of LNG projects awarded in recent years, continuing to grow our aftermarket services offering, driving growth in our valves business and capitalizing on attractive opportunities in the new energy space. During the quarter, we booked an additional award for power generation for the North Field East LNG project in Qatar. This follows the main refrigerant compression award we booked in the third quarter.
For the LNG market overall, our long-term outlook for demand growth remains intact. The recent increase in LNG spot prices has solidified a similar view for many of our customers and improved momentum for a number of projects. As a result, we continue to expect that 3 to 4 projects are likely to move forward in 2021, followed by a robust pipeline of LNG projects that we expect to reach FID beyond 2021.
In our pipeline and gas processing segment, we secured an award with South Gas Company in Iraq for the design, manufacture and construction of an integrated natural gas processing and production facility. An important part of this project is the supply of compression equipment and digital monitoring systems that will enable the reuse of previously flared natural gas, which is estimated to reduce Iraq's carbon emissions by roughly 6 million tons annually. This award highlights our broad capabilities as we seek to deliver a diverse range of decarbonization solutions for our customers.
For TPS, we are optimistic about the outlook for recovery in 2021 and 2022 after a difficult year in 2020 as customers resume spending to maintain and, in some instances, upgrade their equipment. While our contractual services business has remained resilient through the recent market turbulence, we expect growth to be led by a recovery in transactional services and upgrades, areas that were particularly impacted during the pandemic. On a long-term basis, we are excited by recent traction for upgrade opportunities as customers look to decarbonize and improve the efficiency of their equipment.
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we executed on our cost-out efforts and have taken several portfolio actions over the course of 2020. We continue to focus on rightsizing the business and optimizing the portfolio in the face of a challenging offshore market environment. In the fourth quarter, we won an order from Eni for the Agogo field in Angola. The project includes several solutions from our Subsea Connect suite of technologies, including multiple subsea trees, wellheads and manifolds. 
With Brent prices returning to the 50s and more optimistic view for oil demand over the next few years, we see the outlook for industry subsea tree awards improving modestly in 2021, though still well below 2019 levels. As we look out longer term, we believe that deepwater activity will be increasingly dominated by low-cost basins and that it will be difficult to sustain 2019 industry order levels for the foreseeable future.
Finally, in Digital Solutions, the oil and gas and aerospace end markets remain challenging. However, we have seen some recovery in industrial end markets outside of aerospace in line with the rebound in the global economy. In the fourth quarter, we were awarded several projects that demonstrate our capabilities in industrial asset management. We secured an extension to a previously awarded project with Petrobras. We will provide a suite of digital solutions and services to optimize productivity, reduce operational and safety risk and lower carbon emissions across Petrobras sites. 
Our Bently Nevada business secured a contract with a major hydroelectric operator in the U.S. to provide Orbit 60, System 1 software and a 5-year services agreement for industrial asset management across multiple dams. Bently Nevada also secured a fleet-wide contract with the American Energy Power (sic) [ American Electric Power ] to deploy System 1 software, remote monitoring and analytical services to diagnose machinery issues in real time. 
These wins are an example of our deep domain expertise in industrial asset management. Going forward, we see significant opportunities to apply these capabilities in the oil and gas sector, and we believe that these core competencies are also applicable to a number of industrial sectors.
Overall, we executed well in 2020 against the challenge of the global pandemic and the industry downturn, delivering strong free cash flow and executing on our cost-out programs. Baker Hughes is well-placed to navigate the current market environment and positioned to lead the energy transition. We remain focused on executing for customers, being disciplined on cost and delivering for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.2 billion, up 2% sequentially, driven by OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by declines in OFS and TPS. Year-over-year, orders were down 25%, with declines in all 4 segments. Remaining Performance Obligation was $23.4 billion, up 2% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $8 billion, down 3% sequentially; and services RPO ended at $15.4 billion, up 5% sequentially. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.9, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9.
Revenue for the quarter was $5.5 billion, up 9% sequentially, driven by TPS and Digital Solutions, partially offset by low single-digit declines in OFS and OFE. Year-over-year, revenue was down 13%, driven by declines in OFS, OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by an increase in TPS. Operating income for the quarter was $182 million. 
Adjusted operating income was $462 million, which excludes $281 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 98% sequentially and down 15% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 8.4%, up 380 basis points sequentially. We are particularly pleased with the margin improvement in the fourth quarter, which was largely driven by strong execution on our restructuring actions and improvements in operating productivity. 
Corporate costs were $111 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat with fourth quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $307 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect D&A to decline slightly from fourth quarter levels and gradually decline through the year.
Income tax expense in the quarter was $568 million, driven by our geographic mix of earnings, a valuation allowance tax expense of $225 million and a $91 million tax expense related to business dispositions. Although we expect our book tax rate to remain elevated in 2021, we expect our cash taxes to decline.
Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.91. Included in diluted GAAP earnings per share is a $1.4 billion gain on our investment in C3.ai, recorded in other nonoperating income. We invested $69 million in C3.ai when we formed our partnership in June 2019. In December, C3 completed its IPO, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Since our C3 investment is recorded as marketable security on our balance sheet, the change in fair value will be reflected in the other nonoperating income line on a quarterly basis going forward. 
While we are very pleased with our investment, we are equally as pleased with our strong partnership with C3 as we develop and market new AI solutions for the oil and gas industry. We also view our unique C3 partnership as a good example of our capital allocation philosophy as we invest in new technology frontiers and energy transition.
Adjusted loss per share was $0.07. Included in adjusted loss per share are the valuation allowance tax expenses mentioned earlier.
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $250 million. This was driven by an improvement in sequential operating results and modestly lower net CapEx. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter includes $189 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. For the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially primarily due to seasonality. 
When I look at the total year 2020, I am pleased with our financial results considering the disruptions in the global economy, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the significant restructuring that we executed over the year and the number of corporate transactions that we completed. Orders of $20.7 billion for the full year were down 23% in 2020, driven by declines in all segments. Total company book-to-bill was 1 in the year. Total year revenue of $20.7 billion was down 13%. OFS was down 21% and DS declined 19%, partially offset by an increase of 3% in TPS. 
Adjusted operating income of $1 billion was down 35% in the year, with total company adjusted operating income margins declining 170 basis points, mostly driven by volume declines in OFS and DS. Corporate costs for the year were $464 million. For 2021, we expect corporate expenses to decline versus 2020. Our cost-out efforts and lower separation costs should lead to a gradual reduction in quarterly corporate expenses over the course of the year.
During 2020, we exceeded our goal of $700 million in annualized cost savings, with the majority coming out in the second half of the year. And the average cash payback of our restructuring actions has been less than 1 year. In addition to restructuring, we completed the sale of 3 businesses in 2020, including SPC flow in the fourth quarter. These dispositions are in line with our strategy to exit businesses that do not meet our return requirements and are aligned with our broader portfolio evolution objectives. Overall, we believe that the actions taken in 2020 have greatly improved our global operations and helped to lay the groundwork for further improvement in our margin and return profile in the coming years.
For the full year, we generated $518 million of free cash flow. We are pleased with our performance as our capital discipline, cost-out initiatives and working capital release helped to offset lower operating results and $670 million in cash restructuring and separation costs incurred during the year. 
In order to achieve some of our cost-out initiatives in 2021, we booked restructuring and impairment charges of $256 million in the fourth quarter, with an expected cash payback of less than 1 year. Following our cost rationalization actions in 2020, this next phase is primarily associated with optimizing our structural cost, most notably reducing our facilities footprint to align with our broader business transformation objectives. For 2021, we expect free cash flow to improve significantly versus 2020 and to approach historical levels, largely driven by higher operating income, modestly lower CapEx and significantly lower restructuring and separation cash expenditures.
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter to close out a challenging year in the market. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, down 1% sequentially. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, led by declines in Asia Pacific, the North Sea and the Middle East. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially due to solid growth in both the North American land and the offshore markets.
Operating income in the quarter was $142 million, a 53% increase sequentially and a 220 basis point improvement in margin rate. The improvement in margin was driven by our restructuring and cost-out initiatives as well as favorable product mix. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see typical seasonal softness during the quarter, even though international drilling activity has largely stabilized. As a result, we expect our first quarter international revenue to decline modestly on a sequential basis.
In North America, we expect the recent momentum in drilling and completion activity in the U.S. land segment to continue into the first half of 2021 as operators refresh spending budgets. As a result, we expect a modest sequential increase in North American OFS revenues.
Although we should benefit from our cost-out initiatives, margin rates may decline modestly in the first quarter due to international seasonality and fewer product sales. For the full year 2021, our expectations are largely in line with the view we shared in October on our third quarter earnings call.
Internationally, we expect activity levels to stabilize and remain relatively unchanged for the first half of 2021. We currently anticipate a second half recovery in activity across multiple regions. However, we still expect that our international revenue will be down in the mid single-digit range on a year-over-year basis.
The recent increase in commodity prices and the redeployment of budgets have improved the near-term outlook in North America. At the moment, though, activity in the back half of the year remains less clear. As a result, we believe that drilling and completion activity in North America is also likely to be down in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Although OFS revenue will likely be down modestly for the full year, we believe that our cost-out action should still translate to a strong improvement in OFS margin in 2021.
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $561 million, down 49% year-over-year and up 30% sequentially. The sequential improvement in orders was driven by the Eni Agogo award and a strong performance by our SPC project segment, specifically in the Middle East, which helped offset a sequential decline in flexibles orders. Revenue was $712 million, down 7% year-over-year. Revenue declines in subsea services and subsea drilling systems were offset by growth in SPS and flexibles. 
Operating income was $23 million, a 47% improvement year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume in SPS and flexibles, along with help from our cost-out program, which was partially offset by softness in services activity. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating income to also decline sequentially but remain in positive territory, primarily based on our cost-out initiatives.
For the full year 2021, we expect the offshore markets to remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a difficult offshore environment in 2021. Although revenue is likely to be down in 2021, our goal is to maintain positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should offset the decline in volume.
Next, I will cover turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Equipment orders were down 10% year-over-year. We were pleased with another solid quarter of bookings for TPS despite the challenging environment. Orders this quarter were supported by awards for the Iraq flare gas project and power generation units for Qatar Petroleum's NFE project.
Service orders in the quarter were up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in contractual services. Revenue for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 19% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up 67% as we continue to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was down 11% versus the prior year.
Operating income for TPS was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and strong execution on cost productivity. Operating margin was 17.1%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by a higher mix of equipment revenue. 
For the first quarter, we expect revenue to decline sequentially, roughly in line with the last couple of years. Based on this revenue outlook, we expect TPS operating income to grow year-over-year, but expect margin rates to be roughly flat versus the first quarter of 2020 due to a higher mix of equipment revenue.
For the full year 2021, we expect to generate solid year-over-year revenue growth driven by the conversion of our current equipment backlog and a modest increase in TPS service revenues. Although a higher mix of equipment revenue may be a slight headwind for growth in margin rates next year, we still expect solid growth in operating income based on higher volume.
Finally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $528 million, down 18% year-over-year. We saw declines in orders across most end markets, most notably transportation, oil and gas, and industrial. Sequentially, orders were up 7%, driven by seasonality in power and some improvements in transportation.
Revenue for the quarter was $556 million, down 16% year-over-year due to lower volumes across all DS product lines, with the largest declines in Waygate and Reuter Stokes. Sequentially, revenue was up 10% as some industrial end markets begin to recover. 
Operating income for the quarter was $76 million, down 30% year-over-year, driven by lower volume. Sequentially, operating income was up 66%, driven by higher volume across all product lines and cost productivity. For the first quarter, we expect to see sequential revenue declines in line with typical seasonality and operating margin rates back into the single digits.
Looking into 2021, we expect a modest increase in revenue on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With higher volumes and the benefit of our cost-out program, we believe DS margin rates can get back to low double digits for the full year.
Overall, I am pleased with the execution in the fourth quarter and the total year amid a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. While 2021 may have some challenges, we are confident in our strategy and our ability to execute. We remain focused on free cash flow and improving margins and financial returns. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

It looks like good momentum into '21. So lots of moving pieces between '21 versus '20. Brian touched on it in his comments. So core operational cash flow should improve. We're going to lap the severance and restructuring charges, but working capital progress payment tailwinds don't likely recur. CapEx should be pretty restrained. Cash taxes probably helped a little bit. 
So all in, dividend coverage shouldn't be an issue. Is there any reason why we shouldn't translate that into free cash flow north of $1 billion in '21?"

I did say earlier, I would expect free cash flow to get back to historical levels, sort of the '18, '19 level. And you hit on a couple. Based on how we're seeing things play out right now, should see higher earnings, as you mentioned. 
CapEx specifically, I would expect a modest decline versus what we saw in 2020, assuming similar activity levels and what we're seeing right now. Working capital specifically, based on what I'm seeing now, Sean, I'd say, should be neutral or a modest source of cash in '21. And I think it really depends on OFS activity levels and how progress payments play out from new orders in turbo and OFE. 
As I also mentioned, while we expect earnings to be higher, do expect cash taxes to decline as we expect some refunds to come in, in 2021. So that should be a tailwind, as you mentioned. And look, the largest change is really the cash restructuring and separation charges, which will reduce material in 2021. 
So overall, that increase in earnings, the upside from cash restructuring should support material improvement. Feel good about the process improvements we've made. The teams are all over this. It's a key metric in all of our performance metrics and are pleased with the performance there and have got a pretty good construct for '21."

So good inbound across the board, but TPS was the most resilient. You had some nice awards that you called out. 
We're off about 25% year-on-year in '20, not a surprise given the pandemic, and 2019 was quite strong. This is a very common debate today among investors, the trajectory of awards for this business, particularly as LNG sentiment has soured of late and hydrogen expectations have gone hyperbolic. 
So can we just talk about your expectations for keeping your book-to-bill at or above 1x in '21 and beyond? I'm thinking about just kind of buildup of awards the next few years. You've got kind of a base of service awards. You've got line of sight of equipment awards maybe in downstream and then smaller versus larger LNG opportunities."

So again, conversations with customers, given the current pricing, have continued to be positive. And as you look at it from a demand perspective, we continue to believe LNG demand increases as we go forward. 
Outside of LNG equipment, the opportunity set for 2021 seems roughly the same as what we saw in 2020. There could be some mix movement between onshore, offshore and valves and other areas. But the opportunity is roughly the same. And as you said, we are seeing increased traction on CCUS as well as hydrogen. And with the continuing theme of the energy transition, a lot of customer discussions. 
On services, we're optimistic about the outlook for '21 and '22 as customers resume their maintenance activity and also with the opportunity to continue to focus on upgrades of their equipment. So we think TPS services has been underappreciated in the decarbonization theme, and there's potential there for increase in '21, '22. So again, overall, '21, '22, roughly similar to 2020."

And that's also one of the key reasons why we acquired in November, 3C, Compact Carbon Capture, because we see the opportunity of the smaller footprint equipment being very useful there. As you look at it, the IEA already says that there's going to be an increased requirement of carbon capture and -- from 40 million tonnes today up to 750 million tonnes by 2030 and then also to 2.4 billion tonnes by 2050. So hard to give you a precise number. But clearly, it's an important part of the portfolio as it continues to grow, and we expect to see orders coming through in the next 1 to 3 years.

And as we mentioned, we expect activity levels to stabilize and remain relatively unchanged for the first half of '21.

That framework, obviously, is based on our current thinking that there's no material impact from the virus ongoing and lockdowns are maintained to a minimum, which obviously would impact that framework, if it changes. 
But looking at the geographies, we expect a solid recovery to continue in Latin America after depressed levels; also some modest improvement in the North Sea and Russia; and also in the Middle East, a potential second half recovery as things start to improve there. On the offshore markets, similarly mixed, some improvement in areas like Brazil and Norway but also as we look at some stagnant areas in West Africa. 
So as we look at international, I think we still expect that our international revenue will be down in the mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis with an uplift in the second half. 2020 are likely to be a stronger year, just given the macro assumptions that we're seeing -- 2022 is -- sorry."

Angie, just to give you a little more color as I think about the year. I mean first, the team has done, I think, a great job in terms of responding to the environment and really realizing the benefits of multiple years of work to transform the business and the way it operates. 
And specifically around the first quarter, as I mentioned, margin rate could be down slightly based on seasonality and lower product sales. But the decline in volume and mix should be partially offset by the cost-out benefits that we've already seen come through that will carry over as well as additional cost benefits that will come through in the first quarter. 
And then beyond the first quarter, I'm feeling good about the margin accretion that we should see as volume recover seasonally in the second quarter and then with any back-half recovery and activity. So you've got all the restructuring efforts that have started to show benefits, and you see that in the margin rate here in the fourth quarter. And you've got the incremental benefits that will be coming through as we continue to execute on the programs that we just announced. 
And if I think about the exit rate and how to think about the business performance here, assuming there's no unexpected change in product or geographic mix, Angie, we should be in the high single digits by fourth quarter with a shot at reaching double digits depending on volume. And I think the team has shown that they've been executing and having some upside in these restructuring programs.

And Chase, specifically around services as it relates to LNG, I'd remind you that the overwhelming majority of LNG services are on these Contractual Services Agreements. And that revenue has pretty much played out as we expected it to play out this year. So the LNG service isn't really impacted as much by some of the shorter-term and in-year dynamics that you see in other parts of the portfolio. 
I will say though, longer term, for LNG service and CSAs, as we're booking these new orders and things start to come online, you will see more Contractual Service Agreements come into the RPO. And you did see RPO grow in the quarter, and that's really on the back of CSAs and LNG. And as I said, the overwhelming majority sign up for these long-term service agreements. 
Taking a step back, though, and looking at overall TPS services and how I think about getting back to the 2019 baseline. I'd give it a wide time frame, maybe over the next 2 to 3 years. As I said, CSA revenue has been pretty resilient. And we've got good visibility there, given the nature of those contracts and how we operate those. 
Transactional services should see some recovery as customers really stopped delaying maintenance activity and it -- deciding when it normalizes back to 2019 levels is difficult. But we do expect some tailwinds this year based on what we're hearing from customers. 
And I'd say, Chase, that probably the most difficult bucket of revenue to predict is upgrades, which is truly discretionary in nature and is usually one of the first items that operators cut. So I'd say if budget constraints remain in place, it could take upgrades a little while to get back to 2019 levels. Again, we are seeing customers talk about upgrades for various reasons, performance, better cost positioning and then also some of the carbon capture areas that Lorenzo mentioned. So that's why I'd say the visibility is a bit less clear in that area, and why I'd say about 2 to 3 years on getting back to '19 levels."

We are seeing a number of applications that we've put onto the marketplace. You've seen the awards that have happened in Asia as well as Latin America. And the drive for productivity, the drive for reducing nonproductive time really aids the element of introducing artificial intelligence and the platform that C3 has in place. So we're continuing to see good traction with our customer base, and we think that will continue with the drive towards reducing unplanned downtime. 
Internally, we're taking the artificial intelligence and utilizing it within our process improvements of inventory, some of our internal processes as well as then also on our manufacturing base, looking at our own equipment. And increasingly, also looking at some of the services that we provide to our customers as we look at -- with drilling, et cetera, and seeing how we take the different information and anticipate, again, excursions that are taking place in some of the services we provide.

I'd say if you look at revenue today, depending on how you define energy transition, there's a lot in our portfolio that supports that. But things like carbon capture, hydrogen, energy storage, relatively small in terms of revenue base for each of the product companies. 
So look, the way I think about it is -- Lorenzo talked about it. Carbon capture is probably the first area where you'll start to see some meaningful revenue come through over the next few years. We are in pilot projects around the world. We've just made the technology acquisition in 3C, so lots of activities there. 
And as we've talked about on earlier calls, we are in hydrogen today and have been in hydrogen for decades, basically elementary uses for hydrogen and our compression technology. So we're starting to see discussions there with customers. The same thing on the energy storage front. 
So the way I think about it is they will be some of the faster-growing areas, particularly in turbomachinery and in digital solutions, as we build out condition-based monitors and monitoring and sensing technology around that. So I think they will be things that will make turbomachinery go fast -- grow faster because of these new offerings. 
So look, I think the pace at how it happens will really depend on market acceptance and the overall economics of these projects. But I'd say in the short term, carbon capture is the best opportunity in the next 1 to 3 years."

And look, we think the differentiation is important versus traditional carbon capture that Lorenzo had talked about. I mean our technology now uses rotating beds versus static columns. Solvents are distributed in a compact and modularized format. And so that combination allows us to have a 75% reduction in footprint, leading to lower CapEx and lower OpEx solutions. 
So again, our manufacturing know-how, our technology know-how with this new technology that was developed, I think, is what's going to help us become a leader or continue to be a leader in this space. And combine that with our turbomachinery business and what we have to offer there, with all the things that come in from Digital Solutions, we think we already have a very powerful offering in this space, and can start to show some progress with our customers.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, as we generated strong free cash flow, continued to drive forward our cost-out efforts and took further meaningful steps in the execution o",2098,"Thank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results, as we generated strong free cash flow, continued to drive forward our cost-out efforts and took further meaningful steps in the execution of our strategy to lead the energy transition. 
During the quarter, TPS delivered solid orders and operating income, while OFS continued to execute our cost-out program to help drive another strong quarter of margin performance. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will recover from the impact of the global pandemic. As vaccine rollouts ramp up around the world, we expect rising oil and gas demand, combined with continued discipline from OPEC+ and publicly traded operators to rebalance inventories. This should be supportive of higher oil prices and solid free cash flow across the industry. 
Following a resilient 2020, the natural gas and LNG markets longer-term demand outlook appears increasingly positive. We anticipate future demand improving as governments around the world accelerate the transition towards cleaner sources of energy. Accordingly, we see potential upside to our 2030 LNG demand view, which previously called for 550 to 600 MTPA of demand by the end of the decade. Based on recent third-party analysis and directionally supported by discussions with some of our customers, we now see the potential 600 to 650 MTPA of global LNG demand by 2030. 
Outside of oil and gas, the focus on cleaner energy sources and technology to decarbonize resource-intense industries continues to accelerate. The U.S. is more closely aligning with Europe and other developed nations in steering government policy to incentivize clean energy sources as well as carbon capture technologies. We believe that these policy shifts will be crucial to supporting new industry-wide investment in areas like renewables, green hydrogen and CCUS. 
With this overall macro view in mind, we continue to believe that we are taking the right steps with our strategic priorities to position Baker Hughes as the leader in the energy transition. 
We've had a busy start to 2021, making solid progress on all 3 pillars of our strategy. 
On the first pillar, to transform the core of the business, we continued to identify and remove structural costs from our operations, as evidenced by the improvement in our OFS margins despite lower revenue. Our goal is to continue to optimize our processes and infrastructure in order to deliver further cost reductions and footprint consolidation in 2021. 
In addition to cost-out actions, we continued to focus on portfolio optimization to narrow our focus, streamline operations and improve overall operating efficiency. As an example, during the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company, in which we will contribute our Subsea drilling systems product line with Akastor's MHS business. This transaction helps align our portfolio with our long-term strategic objectives. Additionally, we completed the sale of pressure pumping assets in Argentina, which includes the hydraulic fracturing fleet, coil tubing units and related equipment. 
On the second pillar of investing for growth, we continued to identify opportunities to expand in the industrial sector and increase our condition monitoring and asset management offerings. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of Arm's Reliability, an asset reliability services and software company, with a strong presence across a broad range of industrial sectors, including metals and mining, power, manufacturing and utilities. The acquisition enables our Bently Nevada business to expand further into asset performance management and to use the scale of Arm's reliability technology, utilizing our global footprint. This transaction further reinforces our commitment to accelerate the digital transformation of industrial assets across an ever increasing range of end markets. 
On the third pillar of positioning for new frontiers, we took steps to build out our energy transition offerings. We announced an exclusive license for SRI International's mixed salt process for carbon capture. The mixed salt technology enables significant cost reductions to a more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly carbon capture process. This provides total cost of ownership savings for energy and industrial operators to decarbonize their operations. The mixed salt process adds to our portfolio of capture technology development, which also includes the commercially available chilled ammonia process and an immune based process through our Compact Carbon capture acquisition last year. Additionally, we recently announced our intention to invest in the 5 key hydrogen fund alongside other cornerstone investors, Plug Power and Short Industries. This fund, which is targeting an ultimate size of approximately EUR 1 billion, is designed to accelerate the infrastructure and technology investment necessary to develop the hydrogen value chain. 
We have also made progress commercially on our energy transition efforts, building a diverse portfolio of offerings, supported by scale and technology development. In the first quarter, we signed an MOU with Horizon Energy for the Polaris carbon storage project off Northern Coast of Norway. Under the agreement, we will explore the development and integration of technologies to minimize the carbon footprint costs and delivery time of the project. This is a great example of what the unique Baker Hughes portfolio can bring to customers. OFS will bring technology and services to drill and complete the injection wells. OFE will supply subsea trees, control systems and injection risers. CPS will supply compression equipment for CO2 injection, and DS will provide monitoring solutions. 
As we continue to execute on these 3 strategic pillars and our evolution as an energy technology company, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital. 
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. 
In Oilfield Services, activity has increased solidly in its select areas so far this year. The strong commodity price performance has resulted in positive signs of further improvement across multiple regions over the course of 2021. 
In the international markets, we have greater confidence in our outlook for the second half, as customer conversations and project opportunities are firming up in key markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and Russia. Based on discussions with our customers, we still expect a recovery in international activity to be second half weighted, which should provide strong momentum for growth in 2022. 
In North America, stronger than expected activity in the first quarter helped us to mitigate some of the impacts from the Texas winter storms and also provides some upside potential for the full year versus our prior expectations. 
Although the rig count is moving higher, we believe that the commitment towards capital discipline and maintenance mode spending remains intact among the public E&Ps. 
While we're pleased to see the outlook for OFS is improving somewhat faster than we anticipated, our primary focus remains on increasing the margin and return profile of this business through improved efficiency and portfolio actions. We continue to execute on our plan to reduce our rooftops by approximately 100 facilities in 2021 and size our product lines appropriately for the current environment. 
Overall, we believe that OFS remains on track to achieve double-digit operating income margins given the significant structural cost reductions we have made, improved operating process and the increasing use of remote operations. 
Moving to TPS. 
We continue to balance our focus between new energy initiatives and current core operations like LNG, high-technology compression applications, pumps and valves and aftermarket services. 
As I mentioned earlier, our long-term outlook for demand growth in the LNG market is improving. The resilience of demand during the pandemic, combined with the acceleration of climate commitments, has resulted in improving optimism over the demand outlook. This has also been reflected in our conversations with customers. As more nations such as China made net 0 commitments, it is becoming increasingly clear that a phase out of coal in favor of natural gas is necessary to reach their goals as well as broader global carbon targets. 
Based on this outlook, we feel increasingly confident in our expectation of 3 to 4 projects reaching FID in 2021, followed by a strong pipeline of opportunities in 2022 and beyond. 
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, order activity remains solid, with a positive outlook. During the first quarter, we booked awards for power generation and compression equipment for multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. 
For TPS Services, we are optimistic about the outlook for recovery in 2021 and 2022 as customers resume spending to maintain, and in some cases, upgrade their equipment. We expect growth to be led by a recovery in transactional services and upgrades, areas that were particularly impacted in 2020. 
In our Contractual Services business, we are pleased to receive a 10-year contract extension to the existing global service contract with Petronas Malaysia LNG project, one of the largest LNG facilities in the world. This contract is an extension of the 40-year partnership between the TPS team and the Petronas Malaysia LNG. The relationship has included key technology injections that have helped the customer increase production capacity by reducing machine downtime and saving costs with extended meantime between maintenance. 
On a longer-term basis, we are optimistic on the outlook for upgrade opportunities as customers seek to reduce carbon emissions and improve the efficiency of their equipment. As an example, in the first quarter, we announced a cooperation agreement with Novatek to upgrade existing liquefaction trains at Yamal LNG to run on hydrogen blends, supporting their emissions reduction efforts. Together with Novatek, we are introducing the first solution for decarbonizing the core of LNG production, an area we expect to grow meaningfully in the future. 
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we continue to focus on rightsizing the business and optimizing the portfolio in the face of a challenging offshore market environment. With brent prices moving into the 60s and a more optimistic view for oil demand over the next few years, we continue to see the outlook for industry subsea tree awards improving modestly in 2021, though still well below 2019 levels. Longer term, we believe that deepwater activity will be increasingly dominated by low-cost basins and that it will be difficult to sustain 2019 industry order levels for the foreseeable future. 
As I mentioned, in the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a 50-50 joint venture company to deliver global offshore drilling solutions through the combination of our STS business with Akastor's MH Worth business. This transaction will result in a leading equipment and services provider with integrated delivery capabilities, financial strength, a focused and experienced management team and the flexibility to address a full range of customer priorities. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, although our operating results were below our initial expectations, we experienced a strong recovery in orders in the first quarter. This was primarily led by industrial end markets as the global economy began to recover. In the third quarter, we were awarded several projects that demonstrate our capabilities in emissions reduction solutions as well as our growing industrial presence. 
The Panametrics product line secured several orders to the Flare IQ advanced flare gas monitoring and optimization system, with contracts for oil and gas operators in North America, China and the UAE. We signed a new agreement with a customer in the UAE to pilot our Flare IQ technology, marking the first deployment of Flare IQ in the Gulf region. Our technology will enable the customers to reduce methane emissions from flare operations and reduce its operational cost at pilot sites by delivering high-efficiency flare combustion. 
We were also pleased to secure an important award with a major aircraft engine OEM to utilize our drug technology to improve fuel efficiency performance displacing a competitor. Drugs dual channel pressure sensor technology will enable the customer to deliver improved fuel efficiency and reliability performance. 
In our Waygate Technologies business, we were awarded several orders from LG Energy Solutions to support electric vehicle battery cell inspection across facilities in Asia and Europe. 
Overall, we executed well in the first quarter, delivering strong free cash flow and making significant progress on our strategic priorities. We have a broad portfolio and a strategic focus on the rapidly changing energy market. Baker Hughes is well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the global economy and the oil and gas markets near term. Longer term, we are well positioned for growth as we develop decarbonization of solutions across multiple industries. We remain focused on driving better outcomes for customers, executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, down 12% sequentially, driven by OFE and TPS, partially offset by an increase in Digital Solutions. Year-over-",1884,"Thanks, Lorenzo. 
I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. 
Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, down 12% sequentially, driven by OFE and TPS, partially offset by an increase in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were down 18%, driven by declines in OFS and OFE, partially offset by increases in Digital Solutions and TPS. 
Remaining performance obligation was $23.2 billion, down 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.5 billion, down 6% sequentially, and Services RPO ended at $15.7 billion, up 2% sequentially. 
Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.9, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 13% sequentially, with declines in all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was down 12%, driven by declines in OFS, OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by an increase in TPS. 
Operating income for the quarter was $164 million. Adjusted operating income was $270 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the first quarter relate to projects previously announced in 2020. Adjusted operating income was down 42% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 5.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 120 basis points. 
We are pleased with the operating margin improvement on a year-over-year basis, which was largely driven by strong execution on our restructuring actions and continued improvements in operating productivity. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $562 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was down 27% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. 
This quarter, we began disclosing total company adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release as well as EBITDA by reporting segment. In conjunction with this new disclosure, we filed an 8-K this morning that provides 3 years of history by quarter for both total company and reporting segment EBITDA. 
Corporate costs were $109 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat to slightly down compared to first quarter levels from continued cost-out efforts. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $292 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially and to gradually decline in the second half of the year. 
Net interest expense was $74 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $69 million. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.61. Included in GAAP loss per share is a $788 million loss from the change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai, partially offset by the reversal of current accruals of $121 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $498 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter includes $108 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. 
We are particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the quarter. The sequential improvement was largely driven by working capital and a lower level of cash restructuring and separation payments. 
For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially, primarily due to less favorable working capital trends. For the total year, we still expect free cash flow to improve significantly versus 2020 and to be in line with or better than historical levels. The drivers for free cash flow versus 2020 will be higher operating income, modestly lower CapEx and significantly lower restructuring and separation cash payments. 
Lastly, as Lorenzo mentioned, in the first quarter, we reached an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company that will bring together our Subsea Drilling Systems product line with Akastor's wholly-owned subsidiary, MH Worth. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of the year, subject to customary closing conditions. This transaction reflects our continued focus on optimizing our portfolio. 
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. 
In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter in a mixed market environment. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 4% sequentially. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, led by declines in Russia and the Middle East. North America revenue increased 1% sequentially, with solid growth in our North America land well construction businesses, offset by declines in Gulf of Mexico and Chemicals. For the first quarter, our production-related businesses accounted for over 60% of our total North America revenue. 
Despite the 4% decline in revenue, operating income of $143 million grew 1% sequentially, while margin rate expanded 30 basis points to 6.5%. The improvement in margin rate was driven by our restructuring and cost-out initiatives. The OFS team executed very well on robust cost-out programs over the last year under difficult market conditions. 
Despite a 30% decline in OFS revenue versus the first quarter of 2020, EBITDA margin rate for OFS was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.6%. 
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in international activity, which should be followed by a stronger cyclical recovery over the second half of the year. As a result, we expect our second quarter international revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. In North America, we expect the recent momentum in drilling and completion activity in the U.S. land segment to continue. As a result, we expect growth in North American OFS revenues to be in the mid to high single-digit range. We expect solid and steady margin rate improvement through the year as volumes improve and our cost-out reduction efforts yield further results. 
For the full year 2021, our industry outlook has modestly improved from what we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. Internationally, we still expect a second half recovery in activity, with positive signs developing from multiple customers. However, without clear visibility on some of these incremental opportunities, we expect our international revenue to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. 
In North America, the recent increase in commodity prices and strong recovery from private E&Ps have improved the near-term outlook. As activity recovers, we believe that drilling and completion activity is likely to be modestly higher on a year-over-year basis. We expect our North American revenue to lag overall industry spending and rig count trends, given our portfolio mix and the exit of several commoditized businesses last year. 
Although commodity prices have increased and signals around customer spending and rig count are moving in a positive direction, I want to reiterate that we will not be chasing revenue. We remain focused on pursuing projects that are accretive to margins and returns. Given these dynamics, OFS revenue may be down modestly for the full year, but we expect our cost-out actions to translate to a strong improvement in OFS margins in 2021. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. 
Orders in the quarter were $345 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 39% sequentially. Revenue was $628 million, down 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in Subsea Services, Subsea Drilling Systems and the disposition of SPC flow, partially offset by growth in SPS and flexibles. Operating income was $4 million, which is up $12 million year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume in SPS and flexibles, along with help from our cost-out program, partially offset by softness in Services activity and Subsea Drilling Systems. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially, driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating income to remain close to first quarter levels. For the full year 2021, we expect the offshore markets to remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a difficult offshore environment in 2021. 
Although revenue will be down in 2021, our goal remains to generate positive operating income, as our cost-out efforts should offset the decline in volumes. 
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. 
The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 28% year-over-year. Orders this quarter were supported by awards for power generation and compression equipment from multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. Service orders in the quarter were down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in transactional services and contractual services. 
Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up over 100%, as we continued to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was up 6% versus the prior year. 
Operating income for TPS was $207 million, up 55% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and strong execution on cost productivity, partially offset by a higher equipment mix. Operating margin was 13.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. We were very pleased with the margin rate improvement year-over-year, particularly given the change in equipment revenue mix from 32% to 47%. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be roughly flat sequentially based on expected equipment backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020 due to a higher mix of equipment revenue and an increase in technology spending. For the full year 2021, we expect TPS to generate double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by equipment backlog conversion and modest growth in TPS services. We expect a higher mix of equipment revenue to result in roughly flat margin rates year-over-year. However, we still anticipate solid growth in operating income based on higher volumes and improved cost productivity. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $549 million, up 10% year-over-year. We saw growth in orders across oil and gas and most industrial end markets, while aviation remains a challenge. Sequentially, orders were up 4%, driven by the improving global economic environment. 
Revenue for the quarter was $470 million, down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volumes in Nexus Controls, process and pipeline services and Waygate Technologies. Sequentially, revenue was down 15% due to a lower opening backlog, driven by reduced order intake in 2020 as well as typical seasonality. 
Operating income for the quarter was $24 million, down 17% year-over-year, driven by lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity. Sequentially, operating income was down 68%, driven by lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the high-single-digits. For the full year 2021, we expect modest growth in revenue on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With higher volumes and a continued focus on costs, we believe DS margin rates can get back to low double-digits for the full year. 
Overall, we delivered a strong quarter in TPS and OFS, along with exceptionally strong free cash flow. While we faced volume challenges in our OFE and DS businesses, we are confident in our ability to execute as the rest of the year unfolds. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

You walked through the moving parts quite nicely in the prepared comments. Typically, 1Q is seasonally challenging for collections. It sounds like your customers are feeling more comfortable with their cash flow profiles than maybe they did in the back half of last year. But it sounds like free cash flow will be positive even without the collections benefit. So how should we think about that full year free cash flow expectation given the strong start? You'd said you like -- you expect to get back to historical levels. That sounds like maybe in the low $1 billion type of number. Shouldn't expectations start to move higher based on how you started the year?"

And I'd say that the framework that we laid out when we were on the call in January is still largely intact, but with a couple of positive exceptions. And you pointed out",371,"Yes, Sean. Look, we are pleased with how free cash flow is pacing so far this year. And I'd say that the framework that we laid out when we were on the call in January is still largely intact, but with a couple of positive exceptions. And you pointed out one, really driven by receivables and then some work we've been doing around inventory. I think working capital will likely be better and EBITDA is pacing slightly better so far this year. So indications are pretty good for the full year free cash flow performance. 
And as we talked with you about before, we've worked a lot on improving our supply chain and working capital processes. We've gotten a lot of systems in place. And we're becoming more efficient in managing cash collections and inventory overall. And then I think you'll recall we pointed out, I think this is very important, our incentive structure company-wide is really more focused on free cash flow and cash conversion. 
And so look, when I put all that together, I do think there are certainly tailwinds for free cash flow for the year. 
Sean, over the course of the year, working capital can fluctuate just really depending on the dynamics of each segment, OFS activity, TPS progress, collections, but it should be a source of cash this year, and that's a little better than we talked about in January. And just as a reminder, the other drivers of the backdrop of free cash flow for the year: Operating income should be higher; CapEx should be slightly lower with the activity levels that are similar to what we've been talking about here. While earnings are higher, cash taxes should be lower because some of the refunds that we have and the mix of income. 
And then as you know, the biggest thing is just the reduction in restructuring and separation-related charges. We had $108 million in the first quarter. I'd expect the second quarter to be around the same level, Sean, and then taper off in the second half of the year. So as you said, like the start to the year and the progress that we've made and feel pretty good about the overall performance."

And I'd say, based on the actions that we've taken to date and actions we're still executing on and the outlook that we talked about, I continue to believe that we should have operating margin rates in the high single-digits by the fourth quarter, with a real good shot at double-digits. The team is executing incredibly well. Not done with everything that we've got to do, but I think you've seen the momentum here. And the team is still working hard at this and certainly have a lot that they've been working on and are continuing to execute on, and I feel good about their execution capability. So look, you should see a steady margin improvement, obviously, depending on activity levels,throughout the course of the year in OFS. So I'd say we're well on our way. Processes are beginning to be stabilized. And I think we're going to have a great margin business here as we continue to execute this year. 
You pointed out OFS -- or sorry, OFE is a bit of a heavier lift. Pleased with the joint venture announcement that we have. We expect that to close in the second half. And I think that's a good step in our overall portfolio optimization. 
For the remainder of OFE, we're continuing to focus on cost-out across the business as we see overall pressure in the offshore market. We've been reducing headcount and footprint to align with the lower volumes. And I think just given the activity levels and backdrop that we see, we want to offset the volume pressure this year with those cost-out actions.

And then, of course, our view that is LNG is our transition fuel and is -- and it could be a landed fuel even much further in the future. And so I'm curious, your customer base, how they're thinking about LNG. Why you see -- or how you see the upgraded number that you're talking about today and the outlook overall for LNG?"

And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we see the long-term outlook for LNG remaining intact and actually seeing positive upside. And so we've taken up the outlook from 600 to 650 MTPA from what we said previously for demand for 2030. 
And if you look at the backdrop, 2020 was very resilient. And also coming into 2021, you're continuing to see a good demand, robust from countries such as India, China. And there's a couple of factors at play here. Really, the move from coal to natural gas, given some of the commitments relative to energy transition which are going to play out. Also, as you look at getting to 600 million to 650 million tons by the end of the decade from a demand perspective, that means we've got to have approximately 700 million to 800 million tons of nameplate capacity. So that suggests that we're going to have another 100 million to 150 million tons FID over the course of the next 3 to 4 years. And that's an incremental 50 million to 100 million tons than we indicated before. 
So I feel good about that outlook. This year, we still see 3 to 4 FIDs taking place. And in the discussion with customers, there's a lot of offtake discussions with the robust demand outlook. As you look at the backdrop, you've had some expansions in Qatar. You've had some expansions announced in other locations. You've got some of the North America projects that are out there commercially, looking at offtake agreements. And again, it's really encouraging to see just the announcements being made by several of the large users on the way in which they're going to transition from coal to natural gas, which clearly applies to LNG as well. So feel good about the outlook as we go forward."

There could be some mix change from a year-over-year perspective. On the LNG side, as I mentioned, 3 to 4 projects likely to move forward in 2021, followed by a robust pipeline of LNG projects to reach FID beyond 2021. So that continues to be a positive momentum, as we've indicated before. 
For non-LNG equipment, we believe there is an opportunity for 2021 to be in line with 2020. The mix could move around a little bit between onshore and offshore and valves and other areas, but the opportunity is roughly the same. 
We're also starting to see, even though minimal in numbers, an increased traction on our offerings for CCUS and hydrogen. There is a pickup there relative to discussions with customers as more forward-looking, but some of the technologies that we're bringing on to the scene getting traction, and that will bring some possibility over the next couple of years. 
And then Services, we're optimistic with the outlook that we've mentioned for '21 and '22, as customers resume their maintenance activity, and in some cases, also look for upgrade equipment. So again, no real change from what we said, and it's becoming more robust."

As you look at Baker Hughes from a portfolio perspective, I think we're uniquely positioned because we can play across multiple areas of the value chain, if you look at it from a post-combustion capture. We've also got consulting and reservoir evaluation and design, as well as then subsurface storage services like well construction, reservoir modeling, and also, as you look at the longer-term integrity and monitoring. 
As you think about technology from a CCUS perspective, again, you've mentioned some of the carbon capture technologies that we have. Turbomachinery, solvent-based state-of-the-art capture processes are going to be key. The chilled ammonia process, which is commercially available already today, is going to be ideal for large-scale projects. The combat carbon capture, which is rotating bed technology, which we acquired at the end of last year, this is going to be for smaller and mid-scale projects and key for offshore industries as well as cement factories and different types of industries. And then the recently announced mixed salt process, which we mentioned during the SRI International license that we got, which is, again, another process that we'll be utilizing our key equipment and allow for lower energy usage, also reduce water and greater efficiency. So we're building a portfolio here across CCUS from a technology standpoint as well across the value chain."

And we've really looked at 3 things: Where our technology can play today; also how our technology may evolve and the investments required to remain competitive; and also other areas in the value chain. 
So talking specifically to CCUS. We look at the addressable market for ourselves to be between $35 billion to $40 billion by 2030. Now this addressable market covers a full range of technologies that Baker Hughes can currently offer like the carbon capture technologies, we mentioned, the compression storing and monitoring, and also assumes really a relatively mid case of 450 million tons of CCUS by 2030. So feel good about being able to play in this market. And again, it's going to be an important market for us going forward. 
On hydrogen, we've been looking at this for some time. You know we've been present in hydrogen with some of our key technologies already.

In the prepared remarks, we did talk about TPS margin throughout the year as you described. And I'd say, look, the thing you got to keep in mind is that as we execute on our large backlog of projects. Margin rate will likely fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on the equipment service mix, but also due to the mix of the projects in the backlog. There can be some differentiation there just given the broad range of of offerings that we have and the pretty diverse set of projects in the backlog, that range from LNG to onshore offshore production to industrial turbines and some rep and pet things. So look, that's -- quarter-on-quarter, you can see some fluctuation based on that. 
As far as technology goes, roughly in 2020, we spent at the total company level about $600 million on R&D. TPS makes up a decent portion of that given the overall end markets it serves and the new products we're bringing to market and we're focused on. And I'd say, look, from a second quarter standpoint, we are going to see a bit of a ramp-up across some areas in traditional markets like LNG and onshore and offshore production, but also in some of the new frontiers that you've heard us talk about. Lorenzo just described around CCUS hydrogen and then some in energy storage. 
So specifically, we've got some increased program spend in high-pressure recip compressors for hydrogen and some more work on the hydrogen gas turbine development. We already have turbines today that run 100% on hydrogen. There's some more work that we can do to expand that to our broader turbine base. And then, look, we're spending some more in advanced and additive manufacturing to position TPS from a cost and a competitiveness standpoint both in new equipment and services going forward. 
So look, this -- it's a great business, a really strong franchise. You see our positioning in some key markets. And this is an area where we think investments do make sense at this stage. And even despite that, TPS will have a strong year from a margin and overall income standpoint."

I'd say, as we said this year, we do expect solid growth in operating income based on the higher volume, even though mix might be a bit of a headwind from an equipment standpoint, from a rate standpoint. The ot",268,"Yes. Look, I'd point out a couple of things. I'd say, as we said this year, we do expect solid growth in operating income based on the higher volume, even though mix might be a bit of a headwind from an equipment standpoint, from a rate standpoint. The other thing I would point out is services, we are starting to see services pick up a bit. I mean the first quarter service orders and TPS were slightly ahead of 1Q '19 levels, which is, I think, a good indicator. Based on what Lorenzo talked about from LNG order intake and the overall order set, feel good about rebuilding the backlog for equipment. We just booked a large extension on a contractual services agreement in TPS. So our RPO remains robust at about $13.5 billion for services. 
So look, I'd say in '22, when I put all that together, I'd expect service revenue to continue to grow. Depending on how orders play out this year in final backlog conversion, equipment orders could be flattish or modestly down, again depending on timing of how orders come in and the pace of backlog conversion over the next 18 months. And so in this scenario, revenue would be flat or slightly down, but margin, I think, would improve and show some growth in operating income. 
So look, I mean, I think the backdrop from a market standpoint is pretty solid for TPS. From where I sit today, services is showing some nice indication as I mentioned here. And I think the backdrop for '22 margin progression looks pretty good sitting here today."

We are pleased with our first quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow, continued to drive forward our cost-out efforts and took further meaningful steps in the execution of",2088,"Thank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow, continued to drive forward our cost-out efforts and took further meaningful steps in the execution of our strategy to lead the energy transition. During the quarter, TPS delivered solid orders and operating income while OFS continued to execute our cost-out program to help drive another strong quarter of margin performance.  
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will recover from the impact of the global pandemic. As vaccine rollouts ramp up around the world, we expect rising oil and gas demand, combined with continued discipline from OPEC+ and publicly traded operators to rebalance inventories. This should be supportive of higher oil prices and solid free cash flow across the industry.  
Following a resilient 2020, the natural gas and LNG markets' longer-term demand outlook appears increasingly positive. We anticipate future demand improving as governments around the world accelerate the transition towards cleaner sources of energy. Accordingly, we see potential upside to our 2030 LNG demand view, which previously called for 550 to 600 MTPA of demand by the end of the decade. Based on recent third-party analysis and directionally supported by discussions with some of our customers, we now see the potential 600 to 650 MTPA of global LNG demand by 2030.  
Outside of oil and gas, the focus on cleaner energy sources and technology to decarbonize resource-intense industries continues to accelerate. The U.S. is more closely aligning with Europe and other developed nations in steering government policy to incentivize clean energy sources as well as carbon capture technologies. We believe that these policy shifts will be crucial to supporting new industry-wide investment in areas like renewables, green hydrogen and CCUS. With this overall macro view in mind, we continue to believe that we are taking the right steps with our strategic priorities to position Baker Hughes as the leader in the energy transition.  
We've had a busy start to 2021, making solid progress on all 3 pillars of our strategy. On the first pillar, to transform the core of the business, we continued to identify and remove structural costs from our operations as evidenced by the improvement in our OFS margins despite lower revenue. Our goal is to continue to optimize our processes and infrastructure in order to deliver further cost reductions and footprint consolidation in 2021.  
In addition to cost-out actions, we continued to focus on portfolio optimization to narrow our focus, streamline operations and improve overall operating efficiency. As an example, during the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company in which we will contribute our Subsea Drilling Systems product line with Akastor's MHWirth business. This transaction helps align our portfolio with our long-term strategic objectives. Additionally, we completed the sale of pressure pumping assets in Argentina, which includes our hydraulic fracturing fleet, coiled tubing unit and related equipment.  
On the second pillar of investing for growth, we continued to identify opportunities to expand in the industrial sector and increase our condition monitoring and asset management offerings. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of ARMS Reliability, an asset reliability services and software company with a strong presence across a broad range of industrial sectors, including metals and mining, power, manufacturing and utilities. The acquisition enables our Bently Nevada business to expand further into asset performance management and to use the scale of ARMS Reliability technology, utilizing our global footprint. This transaction further reinforces our commitment to accelerate the digital transformation of industrial assets across an ever-increasing range of end markets.  
On the third pillar of positioning for new frontiers, we took steps to build out our energy transition offerings. We announced an exclusive license for SRI International's mixed salt process for carbon capture. The mixed salt technology enables significant cost reductions to a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly carbon capture process. This provides total cost of ownership savings for energy and industrial operators to decarbonize their operations. The mixed salt process adds to our portfolio of capture technology development, which also includes the commercially available chilled ammonia process and an amine-based process through our Compact Carbon Capture acquisition last year. 
Additionally, we recently announced our intention to invest in the FiveT hydrogen funds alongside other cornerstone investors, Plug Power and Chart Industries. This fund, which is targeting an ultimate size of approximately EUR 1 billion, is designed to accelerate the infrastructure and technology investment necessary to develop the hydrogen value chain.  
We have also made progress commercially on our energy transition efforts, building a diverse portfolio of offerings supported by scale and technology development. In the first quarter, we signed an MOU with  Horisont Energi for the Polaris carbon storage project off northern coast of Norway. Under the agreement, we will explore the development and integration of technologies to minimize the carbon footprint, costs and delivery time of the project. 
This is a great example of what the unique Baker Hughes portfolio can bring to customers. OFS will bring technology and services to drill and complete the injection wells. OFE will supply subsea trees, control systems and injection risers. TPS will supply compression equipment for CO2 injection, and DS will provide monitoring solutions. As we continue to execute on these 3 strategic pillars and our evolution as an energy technology company, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital.  
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, activity has increased solidly in select areas so far this year. The strong commodity price performance has resulted in positive signs of further improvement across multiple regions over the course of 2021. In the international markets, we have greater confidence in our outlook for the second half as customer conversations and project opportunities are firming up in key markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and Russia. Based on discussions with our customers, we still expect a recovery in international activity to be second half weighted, which should provide strong momentum for growth in 2022.  
In North America, stronger-than-expected activity in the first quarter helped us to mitigate some of the impacts from the Texas winter storms and also provides some upside potential for the full year versus our prior expectations. Although the rig count is moving higher, we believe that the commitment towards capital discipline and maintenance mode spending remains intact among the public E&Ps.  
While we are pleased to see the outlook for OFS is improving somewhat faster than we anticipated, our primary focus remains on increasing the margin and return profile of this business through improved efficiency and portfolio actions. We continue to execute on our plan to reduce our rooftops by approximately 100 facilities in 2021 and size our product lines appropriately for the current environment. Overall, we believe that OFS remains on track to achieve double-digit operating income margins given the significant structural cost reductions we have made, improved operating process and the increasing use of remote operations.  
Moving to TPS. We continue to balance our focus between new energy initiatives and current core operations like LNG, high-technology compression applications, pumps and valves and aftermarket services. As I mentioned earlier, our long-term outlook for demand growth in the LNG market is improving. The resilience of demand during the pandemic, combined with the acceleration of climate commitments, has resulted in improving optimism over the demand outlook. 
This has also been reflected in our conversations with customers. As more nations such as China make net 0 commitments, it is becoming increasingly clear that a phaseout of coal in favor of natural gas is necessary to reach their goals as well as broader global carbon targets. Based on this outlook, we feel increasingly confident in our expectation of 3 to 4 projects reaching FID in 2021, followed by a strong pipeline of opportunities in 2022 and beyond. 
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, order activity remains solid with a positive outlook. During the first quarter, we booked awards for power generation and compression equipment for multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. For TPS services, we are optimistic about the outlook for recovery in 2021 and 2022 as customers resume spending to maintain and in some cases, upgrade their equipment. We expect growth to be led by a recovery in transactional services and upgrades, areas that were particularly impacted in 2020. 
In our Contractual Services business, we are pleased to receive a 10-year contract extension to the existing global service contract with Petronas Malaysia LNG project, one of the largest LNG facilities in the world. This contract is an extension of the 40-year partnership between the TPS team and the Petronas Malaysia LNG. The relationship has included key technology injections that have helped the customer increase production capacity by reducing machine downtime and saving costs with extended mean time between maintenance.  
On a longer-term basis, we are optimistic on the outlook for upgrade opportunities as customers seek to reduce carbon emissions and improve the efficiency of their equipment. As an example, in the first quarter, we announced a cooperation agreement with NOVATEK to upgrade existing liquefaction trains at Yamal LNG to run on hydrogen blends, supporting their emissions reduction efforts. Together with NOVATEK, we are introducing the first solution for decarbonizing the core of LNG production, an area we expect to grow meaningfully in the future.  
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we continue to focus on rightsizing the business and optimizing the portfolio in the face of a challenging offshore market environment. With Brent prices moving into the 60s and a more optimistic view for oil demand over the next few years, we continue to see the outlook for industry subsea tree awards improving modestly in 2021, though still well below 2019 levels. Longer term, we believe that deepwater activity will be increasingly dominated by low-cost basins and that it will be difficult to sustain 2019 industry order levels for the foreseeable future.  
As I mentioned, in the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a 50-50 joint venture company to deliver global offshore drilling solutions through the combination of our SDS business with Akastor's MHWirth business. This transaction will result in a leading equipment and services provider with integrated delivery capabilities, financial strength, a focused and experienced management team and the flexibility to address a full range of customer priorities.  
Finally, in Digital Solutions, although our operating results were below our initial expectations, we experienced a strong recovery in orders in the first quarter. This was primarily led by industrial end markets as the global economy began to recover. In the first quarter, we were awarded several projects that demonstrate our capabilities in emissions reduction solutions as well as our growing industrial presence.  
The Panametrics product line secured several orders with the Flare.IQ advanced flare gas monitoring and optimization system, with contracts for oil and gas operators in North America, China and the UAE. We signed a new agreement with a customer in the UAE to pilot our Flare.IQ technology, marking the first deployment of Flare.IQ in the Gulf region. Our technology will enable the customers to reduce methane emissions from flare operations and reduce its operational cost at pilot sites by delivering high-efficiency flare combustion.  
We were also pleased to secure an important award with a major aircraft engine OEM to utilize our Druck technology to improve fuel efficiency performance, displacing a competitor. Druck's dual-channel pressure sensor technology will enable the customer to deliver improved fuel efficiency and reliability performance. In our Waygate Technologies business, we were awarded several orders from LG Energy Solutions to support electric vehicle battery cell inspection across facilities in Asia and Europe.  
Overall, we executed well in the first quarter, delivering strong free cash flow and making significant progress on our strategic priorities. With a broad portfolio and a strategic focus on the rapidly changing energy market, Baker Hughes is well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the global economy and the oil and gas markets near term. Longer term, we are well positioned for growth as we develop decarbonization of solutions across multiple industries. We remain focused on driving better outcomes for customers, executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details.  
Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, down 12% sequentially, driven by OFE and TPS partially offset by an increase in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were down 18%, driven by declines in OFS and OFE partially offset by increases in Digital Solutions and TPS. Remaining performance obligation was $23.2 billion, down 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.5 billion, down 6% sequentially, and Services RPO ended at $15.7 billion, up 2% sequentially. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.9, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8.  
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 13% sequentially, with declines in all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was down 12%, driven by declines in OFS, OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by an increase in TPS. 
Operating income for the quarter was $164 million. Adjusted operating income was $270 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the first quarter relate to projects previously announced in 2020. Adjusted operating income was down 42% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 5.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 120 basis points. We are pleased with the operating margin improvement on a year-over-year basis, which was largely driven by strong execution on our restructuring actions and continued improvements in operating productivity.  
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $562 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was down 27% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. This quarter, we began disclosing total company adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release as well as EBITDA by reporting segment. In conjunction with this new disclosure, we filed an 8-K this morning that provides 3 years of history by quarter for both total company and reporting segment EBITDA.  
Corporate costs were $109 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat to slightly down compared to first quarter levels from continued cost-out efforts. Depreciation and amortization expense was $292 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially and to gradually decline in the second half of the year. Net interest expense was $74 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $69 million. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.61. Included in GAAP loss per share is a $788 million loss from the change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai, partially offset by the reversal of current accruals of $121 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12.  
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $498 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter includes $108 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the quarter. The sequential improvement was largely driven by working capital and a lower level of cash restructuring and separation payments. 
For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially primarily due to less favorable working capital trends. For the total year, we still expect free cash flow to improve significantly versus 2020 and to be in line with or better than historical levels. The drivers for free cash flow versus 2020 will be higher operating income, modestly lower CapEx and significantly lower restructuring and separation cash payments.  
Lastly, as Lorenzo mentioned, in the first quarter, we reached an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company that will bring together our Subsea Drilling Systems product line with Akastor's wholly owned subsidiary, MHWirth. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of the year, subject to customary closing conditions. This transaction reflects our continued focus on optimizing our portfolio.  
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter in a mixed market environment. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 4% sequentially. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, led by declines in Russia and the Middle East. North America revenue increased 1% sequentially, with solid growth in our North America land well construction businesses, offset by declines in Gulf of Mexico and chemicals. 
For the first quarter, our production-related businesses accounted for over 60% of our total North America revenue. Despite the 4% decline in revenue, operating income of $143 million grew 1% sequentially while margin rate expanded 30 basis points to 6.5%. The improvement in margin rate was driven by our restructuring and cost-out initiatives. 
The OFS team executed very well on robust cost-out programs over the last year under difficult market conditions. Despite a 30% decline in OFS revenue versus the first quarter of 2020, EBITDA margin rate for OFS was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.6%.  
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in international activity, which should be followed by a stronger cyclical recovery over the second half of the year. As a result, we expect our second quarter international revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. In North America, we expect the recent momentum in drilling and completion activity in the U.S. land segment to continue. As a result, we expect growth in North American OFS revenues to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. We expect solid and steady margin rate improvement through the year as volumes improve and our cost-out reduction efforts yield further results.  
For the full year 2021, our industry outlook has modestly improved from what we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. Internationally, we still expect a second half recovery in activity with positive signs developing from multiple customers. However, without clear visibility on some of these incremental opportunities, we expect our international revenue to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. 
In North America, the recent increase in commodity prices and strong recovery from private E&Ps have improved the near-term outlook. As activity recovers, we believe that drilling and completion activity is likely to be modestly higher on a year-over-year basis. We expect our North American revenue to lag overall industry spending and rig count trends, given our portfolio mix and the exit of several commoditized businesses last year. 
Although commodity prices have increased and signals around customer spending and rig count are moving in a positive direction, I want to reiterate that we will not be chasing revenue. We remain focused on pursuing projects that are accretive to margins and returns. Given these dynamics, OFS revenue may be down modestly for the full year, but we expect our cost-out actions to translate to a strong improvement in OFS margins in 2021.  
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $345 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 39% sequentially. Revenue was $628 million, down 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in Subsea Services, Subsea Drilling Systems and the disposition of SPC flow, partially offset by growth in SPS and flexibles. Operating income was $4 million, which is up $12 million year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume in SPS and flexibles, along with help from our cost-out program, partially offset by softness in services activity and Subsea Drilling Systems. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially, driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating income to remain close to first quarter levels. For the full year 2021, we expect the offshore markets to remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a difficult offshore environment in 2021. Although revenue will be down in 2021, our goal remains to generate positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should offset the decline in volumes.  
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 28% year-over-year. Orders this quarter were supported by awards for power generation and compression equipment from multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. Service orders in the quarter were down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in transactional services and contractual services.  
Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up over 100% as we continued to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was up 6% versus the prior year.  
Operating income for TPS was $207 million, up 55% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and strong execution on cost productivity, partially offset by a higher equipment mix. Operating margin was 13.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. We were very pleased with the margin rate improvement year-over-year, particularly given the change in equipment revenue mix from 32% to 47%.  
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be roughly flat sequentially based on expected equipment backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020 due to a higher mix of equipment revenue and an increase in technology spending. For the full year 2021, we expect TPS to generate double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by equipment backlog conversion and modest growth in TPS services. We expect a higher mix of equipment revenue to result in roughly flat margin rates year-over-year. However, we still anticipate solid growth in operating income based on higher volumes and improved cost productivity.  
Finally, in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $549 million, up 10% year-over-year. We saw growth in orders across oil and gas and most industrial end markets while aviation remains a challenge. Sequentially, orders were up 4%, driven by the improving global economic environment.  
Revenue for the quarter was $470 million, down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volumes in Nexus Controls, Process & Pipeline Services and Waygate Technologies. Sequentially, revenue was down 15% due to a lower opening backlog, driven by reduced order intake in 2020 as well as typical seasonality.  
Operating income for the quarter was $24 million, down 17% year-over-year, driven by lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity. Sequentially, operating income was down 68%, driven by lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the high single digits. For the full year 2021, we expect modest growth in revenue on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With higher volumes and a continued focus on costs, we believe DS margin rates can get back to low double digits for the full year.  
Overall, we delivered a strong quarter in TPS and OFS, along with exceptionally strong free cash flow. While we faced volume challenges in our OFE and DS businesses, we are confident in our ability to execute as the rest of the year unfolds. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

You'd said you like expect to get back to historical levels. That sounds like maybe in the low $1 billion type of number. Shouldn't expectations start to move higher based on how you started the year?"

And I'd say that the framework that we laid out when we were on the call in January is still largely intact but with a couple of positive exceptions. And you pointed out o",372,"Yes, Sean. Look, we are pleased with how free cash flow is pacing so far this year. And I'd say that the framework that we laid out when we were on the call in January is still largely intact but with a couple of positive exceptions. And you pointed out one, really driven by receivables and then some work we've been doing around inventory. I think working capital will likely be better, and EBITDA is pacing slightly better so far this year. So indications are pretty good for the full year free cash flow performance. 
And as we've talked with you about before, we've worked a lot on improving our supply chain and working capital processes. We've gotten a lot of systems in place, and we're becoming more efficient in managing cash collections and inventory overall. And then I think you'll recall we pointed out, I think this is very important, our incentive structure company-wide is really more focused on free cash flow and cash conversion. And so look, when I put all that together, I do think there are certainly tailwinds for free cash flow for the year.  
Sean, over the course of the year, working capital can fluctuate just really depending on the dynamics of each segment, OFS activity, TPS progress, collections, but it should be a source of cash this year. And that's a little better than we talked about in January. 
And just as a reminder, the other drivers of the backdrop of free cash flow for the year. Operating income should be higher. CapEx should be slightly lower with the activity levels that are similar to what we've been talking about here. While earnings are higher, cash taxes should be lower because of some of the refunds that we have and the mix of income.  
And then, as you know, the biggest thing is just the reduction in restructuring and separation-related charges. We had $108 million in the first quarter. I'd expect the second quarter to be around the same level, Sean, and then taper off in the second half of the year. So as you said, like the start to the year and the progress that we've made and feel pretty good about the overall performance."

And I'd say based on the actions that we've taken to date and actions we're still executing on and the outlook that we talked about, I continue to believe that we should have operating margin rates in the high single digits by the fourth quarter, with a real good shot at double digits. 
The team is executing incredibly well. Not done with everything that we've got to do, but I think you've seen the momentum here. And the team is still working hard at this and certainly have a lot that they've been working on and are continuing to execute on, and I feel good about their execution capability. 
So look, you should see a steady margin improvement, obviously, depending on activity levels, throughout the course of the year in OFS. So I'd say we're well on our way. Processes are beginning to be stabilized, and I think we're going to have a great margin business here as we continue to execute this year.  
You pointed out OFS -- or sorry, OFE is a bit of a heavier lift. Pleased with the joint venture announcement that we have. We expect that to close in the second half, and I think that's a good step in our overall portfolio optimization.  
For the remainder of OFE, we're continuing to focus on cost-out across the business as we see overall pressure in the offshore market. We've been reducing head count and footprint to align with the lower volumes. And I think just given the activity levels and backdrop that we see, we want to offset the volume pressure this year with those cost-out actions. So a margin profile that's better but still not where this business needs to be over the long term, and we'll continue to evaluate how we run it differently and better given this market environment."

And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we see the long-term outlook for LNG remaining intact and actually seeing positive upside. And so we've taken up the outlook from 600 to 650 MTPA from what we said previously for demand for 2030. And if you look at the backdrop, 2020 was very resilient, and also coming into 2021, you're continuing to see a good demand, robust from countries such as India, China. And there's a couple of factors at play here, really the move from coal to natural gas given some of the commitments relative to energy transition which are going to play out. 
Also, as you look at getting to 600 million to 650 million tonnes by the end of the decade from a demand perspective, that means we've got to have approximately 700 million to 800 million tonnes of nameplate capacity. So that suggests that we're going to have another 100 million to 150 million tonnes FID over the course of the next 3 to 4 years. And that's an incremental 50 million to 100 million tonnes than we indicated before. So I feel good about that outlook. 
This year, we still see 3 to 4 FIDs taking place. And in the discussion with customers, there's a lot of offtake discussions with the robust demand outlook. As you look at the backdrop, you've had some expansions in Qatar. You've had some expansions announced in other locations. You've got some of the North America projects that are out there commercially looking at offtake agreements. And again, it's really encouraging to see just the announcements being made by several of the large users on the way in which they're going to transition from coal to natural gas, which clearly applies to LNG as well. So feel good about the outlook as we go forward."

There could be some mix change from a year-over-year perspective.

So that continues to be a positive momentum, as we've indicated before. For non-LNG equipment, we believe there is an opportunity for 2021 to be in line with 2020. The mix could move around a little bit between onshore and offshore and valves and other areas, but the opportunity is roughly the same. 
We're also starting to see, even though minimal in numbers, an increased traction on our offerings for CCUS and hydrogen. There is a pickup there relative to discussions with customers. That's more forward-looking but some of the technologies that we're bringing on to the scene getting traction, and that will drive some possibility over the next couple of years. And then services, we're optimistic with the outlook that we've mentioned for '21 and '22 as customers resume their maintenance activity and in some cases, also look for upgrade equipment.

We've also got consulting and reservoir evaluation and design as well as then subsurface, storage, services like well construction, reservoir modeling and also, as you look at the longer term, integrity and monitoring. 
As you think about technology from a CCUS perspective, again, you've mentioned some of the carbon capture technologies that we have. Turbomachinery, solvent-based state-of-the-art capture processes are going to be key. The chilled ammonia process, which is commercially available already today, is going to be ideal for large-scale projects. The Compact Carbon Capture, which is rotating bed technology, which we acquired at the end of last year, this is going to be for smaller and mid-scale projects and key for offshore industries as well as cement factories and different types of industries. And then, this recently announced mixed salt process, which we mentioned during the -- SRI International license that we got, which is, again, another process that we'll be utilizing our key equipment and allow for lower energy usage, also reduced water and greater efficiency.

So talking specifically to CCUS. We look at the addressable market for ourselves to be between $35 billion to $40 billion by 2030. Now this addressable market covers a full range of technologies that Baker Hughes can currently offer like the carbon capture technologies we mentioned, the compression, storing and monitoring, and also assumes really a relatively mid case of 450 million tonnes of CCUS by 2030.

In the prepared remarks, we did talk about TPS margin throughout the year, as you described. And I'd say, look, the thing you got to keep in mind is that as we execute on our large backlog of projects, margin rate will likely fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on the equipment/service mix but also due to the mix of the projects in the backlog. There can be some differentiation there just given the broad range of  offerings that we have and the pretty diverse set of projects in the backlog that range from LNG to onshore/offshore production, to industrial turbines and some ref and pet things. So look, that's -- quarter-on-quarter, you can see some fluctuation based on that. 
As far as technology goes, roughly, in 2020, we spent at the total company level about $600 million on R&D. TPS makes up a decent portion of that given the overall end markets it serves and the new products we're bringing to market and we're focused on. And I'd say, look, from a second quarter standpoint, we are going to see a bit of a ramp-up across some areas in traditional markets like LNG and onshore and offshore production but also in some of the new frontiers that you've heard us talk about, Lorenzo just described around CCUS hydrogen and then some in energy storage. 
So specifically, we've got some increased program spend in high-pressure recip compressors for hydrogen and some more work on the hydrogen gas turbine development. We already have turbines today that run 100% on hydrogen. There's some more work that we can do to expand that to our broader turbine base. And then, look, we're spending some more in advanced and additive manufacturing to position TPS from a cost and a competitiveness standpoint, both in new equipment and services going forward. 
So look, this -- it's a great business, a really strong franchise. You see our positioning in some key markets. And this is an area where we think investments do make sense at this stage. And even despite that, TPS will have a strong year from a margin and overall income standpoint."

I'd say, as we said this year, we do expect solid growth in operating income based on the higher volume even though mix might be a bit of a headwind from an equipment standpoint, from a rate standpoint. 
The other thing I would point out is services -- we are starting to see services pick up a bit. I mean the first quarter service orders in TPS were slightly ahead of 1Q '19 levels, which is, I think, a good indicator. Based on what Lorenzo talked about from LNG order intake and the overall order set, feel good about rebuilding the backlog for equipment. We just booked a large extension on a contractual services agreement in TPS. So our RPO remains robust at about $13.5 billion for services. So look, I'd say in '22, when I put all that together, I'd expect service revenue to continue to grow. 
Depending on how orders play out this year and final backlog conversion, equipment orders could be flattish or modestly down, again depending on timing of how orders come in and the pace of backlog conversion over the next 18 months. And so in this scenario, revenue would be flat or slightly down, but margin, I think, would improve and show some growth in operating income. 
So look, I mean, I think the backdrop from a market standpoint is pretty solid for TPS from where I sit today. Services is showing some nice indication, as I mentioned here. And I think the backdrop for '22 margin progression looks pretty good sitting here today."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 
We are pleased with our first quarter results as we generated strong free cash flow, continued to drive forward our cost-out efforts and took further meaningful steps in the execution of our strategy to lead the energy transition. During the quarter, TPS delivered solid orders and operating income while OFS continued to execute our cost-out program to help drive another strong quarter of margin performance.  
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we remain cautiously optimistic that the global economy and oil demand will recover from the impact of the global pandemic. As vaccine rollouts ramp up around the world, we expect rising oil and gas demand, combined with continued discipline from OPEC+ and publicly traded operators to rebalance inventories. This should be supportive of higher oil prices and solid free cash flow across the industry.  
Following a resilient 2020, the natural gas and LNG markets' longer-term demand outlook appears increasingly positive. We anticipate future demand improving as governments around the world accelerate the transition towards cleaner sources of energy. Accordingly, we see potential upside to our 2030 LNG demand view, which previously called for 550 to 600 MTPA of demand by the end of the decade. Based on recent third-party analysis and directionally supported by discussions with some of our customers, we now see the potential 600 to 650 MTPA of global LNG demand by 2030.  
Outside of oil and gas, the focus on cleaner energy sources and technology to decarbonize resource-intense industries continues to accelerate. The U.S. is more closely aligning with Europe and other developed nations in steering government policy to incentivize clean energy sources as well as carbon capture technologies. We believe that these policy shifts will be crucial to supporting new industry-wide investment in areas like renewables, green hydrogen and CCUS. With this overall macro view in mind, we continue to believe that we are taking the right steps with our strategic priorities to position Baker Hughes as the leader in the energy transition.  
We've had a busy start to 2021, making solid progress on all 3 pillars of our strategy. On the first pillar, to transform the core of the business, we continued to identify and remove structural costs from our operations as evidenced by the improvement in our OFS margins despite lower revenue. Our goal is to continue to optimize our processes and infrastructure in order to deliver further cost reductions and footprint consolidation in 2021.  
In addition to cost-out actions, we continued to focus on portfolio optimization to narrow our focus, streamline operations and improve overall operating efficiency. As an example, during the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company in which we will contribute our Subsea Drilling Systems product line with Akastor's MHWirth business. This transaction helps align our portfolio with our long-term strategic objectives. Additionally, we completed the sale of pressure pumping assets in Argentina, which includes our hydraulic fracturing fleet, coiled tubing unit and related equipment.  
On the second pillar of investing for growth, we continued to identify opportunities to expand in the industrial sector and increase our condition monitoring and asset management offerings. To that end, in the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of ARMS Reliability, an asset reliability services and software company with a strong presence across a broad range of industrial sectors, including metals and mining, power, manufacturing and utilities. The acquisition enables our Bently Nevada business to expand further into asset performance management and to use the scale of ARMS Reliability technology, utilizing our global footprint. This transaction further reinforces our commitment to accelerate the digital transformation of industrial assets across an ever-increasing range of end markets.  
On the third pillar of positioning for new frontiers, we took steps to build out our energy transition offerings. We announced an exclusive license for SRI International's mixed salt process for carbon capture. The mixed salt technology enables significant cost reductions to a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly carbon capture process. This provides total cost of ownership savings for energy and industrial operators to decarbonize their operations. The mixed salt process adds to our portfolio of capture technology development, which also includes the commercially available chilled ammonia process and an amine-based process through our Compact Carbon Capture acquisition last year. 
Additionally, we recently announced our intention to invest in the FiveT hydrogen funds alongside other cornerstone investors, Plug Power and Chart Industries. This fund, which is targeting an ultimate size of approximately EUR 1 billion, is designed to accelerate the infrastructure and technology investment necessary to develop the hydrogen value chain.  
We have also made progress commercially on our energy transition efforts, building a diverse portfolio of offerings supported by scale and technology development. In the first quarter, we signed an MOU with  Horisont Energi for the Polaris carbon storage project off northern coast of Norway. Under the agreement, we will explore the development and integration of technologies to minimize the carbon footprint, costs and delivery time of the project. 
This is a great example of what the unique Baker Hughes portfolio can bring to customers. OFS will bring technology and services to drill and complete the injection wells. OFE will supply subsea trees, control systems and injection risers. TPS will supply compression equipment for CO2 injection, and DS will provide monitoring solutions. As we continue to execute on these 3 strategic pillars and our evolution as an energy technology company, we will maintain our discipline and prioritize free cash flow and returns above our cost of capital.  
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, activity has increased solidly in select areas so far this year. The strong commodity price performance has resulted in positive signs of further improvement across multiple regions over the course of 2021. In the international markets, we have greater confidence in our outlook for the second half as customer conversations and project opportunities are firming up in key markets such as the Middle East, Latin America and Russia. Based on discussions with our customers, we still expect a recovery in international activity to be second half weighted, which should provide strong momentum for growth in 2022.  
In North America, stronger-than-expected activity in the first quarter helped us to mitigate some of the impacts from the Texas winter storms and also provides some upside potential for the full year versus our prior expectations. Although the rig count is moving higher, we believe that the commitment towards capital discipline and maintenance mode spending remains intact among the public E&Ps.  
While we are pleased to see the outlook for OFS is improving somewhat faster than we anticipated, our primary focus remains on increasing the margin and return profile of this business through improved efficiency and portfolio actions. We continue to execute on our plan to reduce our rooftops by approximately 100 facilities in 2021 and size our product lines appropriately for the current environment. Overall, we believe that OFS remains on track to achieve double-digit operating income margins given the significant structural cost reductions we have made, improved operating process and the increasing use of remote operations.  
Moving to TPS. We continue to balance our focus between new energy initiatives and current core operations like LNG, high-technology compression applications, pumps and valves and aftermarket services. As I mentioned earlier, our long-term outlook for demand growth in the LNG market is improving. The resilience of demand during the pandemic, combined with the acceleration of climate commitments, has resulted in improving optimism over the demand outlook. 
This has also been reflected in our conversations with customers. As more nations such as China make net 0 commitments, it is becoming increasingly clear that a phaseout of coal in favor of natural gas is necessary to reach their goals as well as broader global carbon targets. Based on this outlook, we feel increasingly confident in our expectation of 3 to 4 projects reaching FID in 2021, followed by a strong pipeline of opportunities in 2022 and beyond. 
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, order activity remains solid with a positive outlook. During the first quarter, we booked awards for power generation and compression equipment for multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. For TPS services, we are optimistic about the outlook for recovery in 2021 and 2022 as customers resume spending to maintain and in some cases, upgrade their equipment. We expect growth to be led by a recovery in transactional services and upgrades, areas that were particularly impacted in 2020. 
In our Contractual Services business, we are pleased to receive a 10-year contract extension to the existing global service contract with Petronas Malaysia LNG project, one of the largest LNG facilities in the world. This contract is an extension of the 40-year partnership between the TPS team and the Petronas Malaysia LNG. The relationship has included key technology injections that have helped the customer increase production capacity by reducing machine downtime and saving costs with extended mean time between maintenance.  
On a longer-term basis, we are optimistic on the outlook for upgrade opportunities as customers seek to reduce carbon emissions and improve the efficiency of their equipment. As an example, in the first quarter, we announced a cooperation agreement with NOVATEK to upgrade existing liquefaction trains at Yamal LNG to run on hydrogen blends, supporting their emissions reduction efforts. Together with NOVATEK, we are introducing the first solution for decarbonizing the core of LNG production, an area we expect to grow meaningfully in the future.  
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we continue to focus on rightsizing the business and optimizing the portfolio in the face of a challenging offshore market environment. With Brent prices moving into the 60s and a more optimistic view for oil demand over the next few years, we continue to see the outlook for industry subsea tree awards improving modestly in 2021, though still well below 2019 levels. Longer term, we believe that deepwater activity will be increasingly dominated by low-cost basins and that it will be difficult to sustain 2019 industry order levels for the foreseeable future.  
As I mentioned, in the first quarter, we announced an agreement with Akastor to create a 50-50 joint venture company to deliver global offshore drilling solutions through the combination of our SDS business with Akastor's MHWirth business. This transaction will result in a leading equipment and services provider with integrated delivery capabilities, financial strength, a focused and experienced management team and the flexibility to address a full range of customer priorities.  
Finally, in Digital Solutions, although our operating results were below our initial expectations, we experienced a strong recovery in orders in the first quarter. This was primarily led by industrial end markets as the global economy began to recover. In the first quarter, we were awarded several projects that demonstrate our capabilities in emissions reduction solutions as well as our growing industrial presence.  
The Panametrics product line secured several orders with the Flare.IQ advanced flare gas monitoring and optimization system, with contracts for oil and gas operators in North America, China and the UAE. We signed a new agreement with a customer in the UAE to pilot our Flare.IQ technology, marking the first deployment of Flare.IQ in the Gulf region. Our technology will enable the customers to reduce methane emissions from flare operations and reduce its operational cost at pilot sites by delivering high-efficiency flare combustion.  
We were also pleased to secure an important award with a major aircraft engine OEM to utilize our Druck technology to improve fuel efficiency performance, displacing a competitor. Druck's dual-channel pressure sensor technology will enable the customer to deliver improved fuel efficiency and reliability performance. In our Waygate Technologies business, we were awarded several orders from LG Energy Solutions to support electric vehicle battery cell inspection across facilities in Asia and Europe.  
Overall, we executed well in the first quarter, delivering strong free cash flow and making significant progress on our strategic priorities. With a broad portfolio and a strategic focus on the rapidly changing energy market, Baker Hughes is well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the global economy and the oil and gas markets near term. Longer term, we are well positioned for growth as we develop decarbonization of solutions across multiple industries. We remain focused on driving better outcomes for customers, executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details.  
Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion, down 12% sequentially, driven by OFE and TPS partially offset by an increase in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were down 18%, driven by declines in OFS and OFE partially offset by increases in Digital Solutions and TPS. Remaining performance obligation was $23.2 billion, down 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.5 billion, down 6% sequentially, and Services RPO ended at $15.7 billion, up 2% sequentially. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 0.9, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.8.  
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 13% sequentially, with declines in all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was down 12%, driven by declines in OFS, OFE and Digital Solutions, partially offset by an increase in TPS. 
Operating income for the quarter was $164 million. Adjusted operating income was $270 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the first quarter relate to projects previously announced in 2020. Adjusted operating income was down 42% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. 
Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 5.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 120 basis points. We are pleased with the operating margin improvement on a year-over-year basis, which was largely driven by strong execution on our restructuring actions and continued improvements in operating productivity.  
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $562 million, which excludes $106 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was down 27% sequentially and down 5% year-over-year. This quarter, we began disclosing total company adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release as well as EBITDA by reporting segment. In conjunction with this new disclosure, we filed an 8-K this morning that provides 3 years of history by quarter for both total company and reporting segment EBITDA.  
Corporate costs were $109 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat to slightly down compared to first quarter levels from continued cost-out efforts. Depreciation and amortization expense was $292 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially and to gradually decline in the second half of the year. Net interest expense was $74 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $69 million. 
GAAP loss per share was $0.61. Included in GAAP loss per share is a $788 million loss from the change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai, partially offset by the reversal of current accruals of $121 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.12.  
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $498 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter includes $108 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the quarter. The sequential improvement was largely driven by working capital and a lower level of cash restructuring and separation payments. 
For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially primarily due to less favorable working capital trends. For the total year, we still expect free cash flow to improve significantly versus 2020 and to be in line with or better than historical levels. The drivers for free cash flow versus 2020 will be higher operating income, modestly lower CapEx and significantly lower restructuring and separation cash payments.  
Lastly, as Lorenzo mentioned, in the first quarter, we reached an agreement with Akastor to create a joint venture company that will bring together our Subsea Drilling Systems product line with Akastor's wholly owned subsidiary, MHWirth. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of the year, subject to customary closing conditions. This transaction reflects our continued focus on optimizing our portfolio.  
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter in a mixed market environment. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 4% sequentially. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, led by declines in Russia and the Middle East. North America revenue increased 1% sequentially, with solid growth in our North America land well construction businesses, offset by declines in Gulf of Mexico and chemicals. 
For the first quarter, our production-related businesses accounted for over 60% of our total North America revenue. Despite the 4% decline in revenue, operating income of $143 million grew 1% sequentially while margin rate expanded 30 basis points to 6.5%. The improvement in margin rate was driven by our restructuring and cost-out initiatives. 
The OFS team executed very well on robust cost-out programs over the last year under difficult market conditions. Despite a 30% decline in OFS revenue versus the first quarter of 2020, EBITDA margin rate for OFS was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 15.6%.  
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in international activity, which should be followed by a stronger cyclical recovery over the second half of the year. As a result, we expect our second quarter international revenue to increase in the mid-single-digit range on a sequential basis. In North America, we expect the recent momentum in drilling and completion activity in the U.S. land segment to continue. As a result, we expect growth in North American OFS revenues to be in the mid- to high single-digit range. We expect solid and steady margin rate improvement through the year as volumes improve and our cost-out reduction efforts yield further results.  
For the full year 2021, our industry outlook has modestly improved from what we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. Internationally, we still expect a second half recovery in activity with positive signs developing from multiple customers. However, without clear visibility on some of these incremental opportunities, we expect our international revenue to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. 
In North America, the recent increase in commodity prices and strong recovery from private E&Ps have improved the near-term outlook. As activity recovers, we believe that drilling and completion activity is likely to be modestly higher on a year-over-year basis. We expect our North American revenue to lag overall industry spending and rig count trends, given our portfolio mix and the exit of several commoditized businesses last year. 
Although commodity prices have increased and signals around customer spending and rig count are moving in a positive direction, I want to reiterate that we will not be chasing revenue. We remain focused on pursuing projects that are accretive to margins and returns. Given these dynamics, OFS revenue may be down modestly for the full year, but we expect our cost-out actions to translate to a strong improvement in OFS margins in 2021.  
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $345 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 39% sequentially. Revenue was $628 million, down 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in Subsea Services, Subsea Drilling Systems and the disposition of SPC flow, partially offset by growth in SPS and flexibles. Operating income was $4 million, which is up $12 million year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume in SPS and flexibles, along with help from our cost-out program, partially offset by softness in services activity and Subsea Drilling Systems. 
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially, driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating income to remain close to first quarter levels. For the full year 2021, we expect the offshore markets to remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a difficult offshore environment in 2021. Although revenue will be down in 2021, our goal remains to generate positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should offset the decline in volumes.  
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 28% year-over-year. Orders this quarter were supported by awards for power generation and compression equipment from multiple FPSOs in Latin America and for a fixed platform in Asia. Service orders in the quarter were down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in transactional services and contractual services.  
Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up over 100% as we continued to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was up 6% versus the prior year.  
Operating income for TPS was $207 million, up 55% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and strong execution on cost productivity, partially offset by a higher equipment mix. Operating margin was 13.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. We were very pleased with the margin rate improvement year-over-year, particularly given the change in equipment revenue mix from 32% to 47%.  
For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be roughly flat sequentially based on expected equipment backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020 due to a higher mix of equipment revenue and an increase in technology spending. For the full year 2021, we expect TPS to generate double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, driven by equipment backlog conversion and modest growth in TPS services. We expect a higher mix of equipment revenue to result in roughly flat margin rates year-over-year. However, we still anticipate solid growth in operating income based on higher volumes and improved cost productivity.  
Finally, in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $549 million, up 10% year-over-year. We saw growth in orders across oil and gas and most industrial end markets while aviation remains a challenge. Sequentially, orders were up 4%, driven by the improving global economic environment.  
Revenue for the quarter was $470 million, down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volumes in Nexus Controls, Process & Pipeline Services and Waygate Technologies. Sequentially, revenue was down 15% due to a lower opening backlog, driven by reduced order intake in 2020 as well as typical seasonality.  
Operating income for the quarter was $24 million, down 17% year-over-year, driven by lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity. Sequentially, operating income was down 68%, driven by lower volume. 
For the second quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the high single digits. For the full year 2021, we expect modest growth in revenue on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With higher volumes and a continued focus on costs, we believe DS margin rates can get back to low double digits for the full year.  
Overall, we delivered a strong quarter in TPS and OFS, along with exceptionally strong free cash flow. While we faced volume challenges in our OFE and DS businesses, we are confident in our ability to execute as the rest of the year unfolds. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

And typically, 1Q is seasonally challenging for collections. It sounds like your customers are feeling more comfortable with their cash flow profiles than maybe they did in the back half of last year, but it sounds like free cash flow will be positive even without the collections benefit. So how should we think about that full year free cash flow expectation given the strong start? 
You'd said you like expect to get back to historical levels. That sounds like maybe in the low $1 billion type of number. Shouldn't expectations start to move higher based on how you started the year?"

Look, we are pleased with how free cash flow is pacing so far this year. And I'd say that the framework that we laid out when we were on the call in January is still largely intact but with a couple of positive exceptions. And you pointed out one, really driven by receivables and then some work we've been doing around inventory. I think working capital will likely be better, and EBITDA is pacing slightly better so far this year. So indications are pretty good for the full year free cash flow performance. 
And as we've talked with you about before, we've worked a lot on improving our supply chain and working capital processes. We've gotten a lot of systems in place, and we're becoming more efficient in managing cash collections and inventory overall. And then I think you'll recall we pointed out, I think this is very important, our incentive structure company-wide is really more focused on free cash flow and cash conversion. And so look, when I put all that together, I do think there are certainly tailwinds for free cash flow for the year.  
Sean, over the course of the year, working capital can fluctuate just really depending on the dynamics of each segment, OFS activity, TPS progress, collections, but it should be a source of cash this year. And that's a little better than we talked about in January. 
And just as a reminder, the other drivers of the backdrop of free cash flow for the year. Operating income should be higher. CapEx should be slightly lower with the activity levels that are similar to what we've been talking about here. While earnings are higher, cash taxes should be lower because of some of the refunds that we have and the mix of income.  
And then, as you know, the biggest thing is just the reduction in restructuring and separation-related charges. We had $108 million in the first quarter. I'd expect the second quarter to be around the same level, Sean, and then taper off in the second half of the year. So as you said, like the start to the year and the progress that we've made and feel pretty good about the overall performance."

And I'd say based on the actions that we've taken to date and actions we're still executing on and the outlook that we talked about, I continue to believe that we should have operating margin rates in the high single digits by the fourth quarter, with a real good shot at double digits. 
The team is executing incredibly well. Not done with everything that we've got to do, but I think you've seen the momentum here. And the team is still working hard at this and certainly have a lot that they've been working on and are continuing to execute on, and I feel good about their execution capability. 
So look, you should see a steady margin improvement, obviously, depending on activity levels, throughout the course of the year in OFS. So I'd say we're well on our way. Processes are beginning to be stabilized, and I think we're going to have a great margin business here as we continue to execute this year.  
You pointed out OFS -- or sorry, OFE is a bit of a heavier lift. Pleased with the joint venture announcement that we have. We expect that to close in the second half, and I think that's a good step in our overall portfolio optimization.  
For the remainder of OFE, we're continuing to focus on cost-out across the business as we see overall pressure in the offshore market. We've been reducing head count and footprint to align with the lower volumes. And I think just given the activity levels and backdrop that we see, we want to offset the volume pressure this year with those cost-out actions. So a margin profile that's better but still not where this business needs to be over the long term, and we'll continue to evaluate how we run it differently and better given this market environment."

And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we see the long-term outlook for LNG remaining intact and actually seeing positive upside. And so we've taken up the outlook from 600 to 650 MTPA from what we said previously for demand for 2030. And if you look at the backdrop, 2020 was very resilient, and also coming into 2021, you're continuing to see a good demand, robust from countries such as India, China. And there's a couple of factors at play here, really the move from coal to natural gas given some of the commitments relative to energy transition which are going to play out. 
Also, as you look at getting to 600 million to 650 million tonnes by the end of the decade from a demand perspective, that means we've got to have approximately 700 million to 800 million tonnes of nameplate capacity. So that suggests that we're going to have another 100 million to 150 million tonnes FID over the course of the next 3 to 4 years. And that's an incremental 50 million to 100 million tonnes than we indicated before. So I feel good about that outlook. 
This year, we still see 3 to 4 FIDs taking place. And in the discussion with customers, there's a lot of offtake discussions with the robust demand outlook. As you look at the backdrop, you've had some expansions in Qatar. You've had some expansions announced in other locations. You've got some of the North America projects that are out there commercially looking at offtake agreements. And again, it's really encouraging to see just the announcements being made by several of the large users on the way in which they're going to transition from coal to natural gas, which clearly applies to LNG as well. So feel good about the outlook as we go forward."

So that continues to be a positive momentum, as we've indicated before. For non-LNG equipment, we believe there is an opportunity for 2021 to be in line with 2020. The mix could move around a little bit between onshore and offshore and valves and other areas, but the opportunity is roughly the same. 
We're also starting to see, even though minimal in numbers, an increased traction on our offerings for CCUS and hydrogen. There is a pickup there relative to discussions with customers. That's more forward-looking but some of the technologies that we're bringing on to the scene getting traction, and that will drive some possibility over the next couple of years. And then services, we're optimistic with the outlook that we've mentioned for '21 and '22 as customers resume their maintenance activity and in some cases, also look for upgrade equipment.

We've also got consulting and reservoir evaluation and design as well as then subsurface, storage, services like well construction, reservoir modeling and also, as you look at the longer term, integrity and monitoring. 
As you think about technology from a CCUS perspective, again, you've mentioned some of the carbon capture technologies that we have. Turbomachinery, solvent-based state-of-the-art capture processes are going to be key. The chilled ammonia process, which is commercially available already today, is going to be ideal for large-scale projects. The Compact Carbon Capture, which is rotating bed technology, which we acquired at the end of last year, this is going to be for smaller and mid-scale projects and key for offshore industries as well as cement factories and different types of industries. And then, this recently announced mixed salt process, which we mentioned during the -- SRI International license that we got, which is, again, another process that we'll be utilizing our key equipment and allow for lower energy usage, also reduced water and greater efficiency. So we're building a portfolio here across CCUS from a technology standpoint as well across the value chain."

So talking specifically to CCUS. We look at the addressable market for ourselves to be between $35 billion to $40 billion by 2030. Now this addressable market covers a full range of technologies that Baker Hughes can currently offer like the carbon capture technologies we mentioned, the compression, storing and monitoring, and also assumes really a relatively mid case of 450 million tonnes of CCUS by 2030.

In the prepared remarks, we did talk about TPS margin throughout the year, as you described. And I'd say, look, the thing you got to keep in mind is that as we execute on our large backlog of projects, margin rate will likely fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on the equipment/service mix but also due to the mix of the projects in the backlog. There can be some differentiation there just given the broad range of  offerings that we have and the pretty diverse set of projects in the backlog that range from LNG to onshore/offshore production, to industrial turbines and some ref and pet things. So look, that's -- quarter-on-quarter, you can see some fluctuation based on that. 
As far as technology goes, roughly, in 2020, we spent at the total company level about $600 million on R&D. TPS makes up a decent portion of that given the overall end markets it serves and the new products we're bringing to market and we're focused on. And I'd say, look, from a second quarter standpoint, we are going to see a bit of a ramp-up across some areas in traditional markets like LNG and onshore and offshore production but also in some of the new frontiers that you've heard us talk about, Lorenzo just described around CCUS hydrogen and then some in energy storage. 
So specifically, we've got some increased program spend in high-pressure recip compressors for hydrogen and some more work on the hydrogen gas turbine development. We already have turbines today that run 100% on hydrogen. There's some more work that we can do to expand that to our broader turbine base. And then, look, we're spending some more in advanced and additive manufacturing to position TPS from a cost and a competitiveness standpoint, both in new equipment and services going forward. 
So look, this -- it's a great business, a really strong franchise. You see our positioning in some key markets. And this is an area where we think investments do make sense at this stage. And even despite that, TPS will have a strong year from a margin and overall income standpoint."

Customers on the back end of that, on the LNG side, we are hearing that there is a move towards more disclosure, more transparency. And we think we can actually apply that to helping our customers because we've got new equipment that can upgrade and reduce the carbon intensity. We've also got capabilities around CCUS. So LNG is a destination transition fuel for the energy transition.

I'd say, as we said this year, we do expect solid growth in operating income based on the higher volume even though mix might be a bit of a headwind from an equipment standpoint, from a rate standpoint. 
The other thing I would point out is services -- we are starting to see services pick up a bit. I mean the first quarter service orders in TPS were slightly ahead of 1Q '19 levels, which is, I think, a good indicator. Based on what Lorenzo talked about from LNG order intake and the overall order set, feel good about rebuilding the backlog for equipment. We just booked a large extension on a contractual services agreement in TPS. So our RPO remains robust at about $13.5 billion for services. So look, I'd say in '22, when I put all that together, I'd expect service revenue to continue to grow. 
Depending on how orders play out this year and final backlog conversion, equipment orders could be flattish or modestly down, again depending on timing of how orders come in and the pace of backlog conversion over the next 18 months. And so in this scenario, revenue would be flat or slightly down, but margin, I think, would improve and show some growth in operating income. 
So look, I mean, I think the backdrop from a market standpoint is pretty solid for TPS from where I sit today. Services is showing some nice indication, as I mentioned here. And I think the backdrop for '22 margin progression looks pretty good sitting here today."

During the second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow, booked several key awards and took a number of positive steps in our journey to grow our new energy businesses. At a product company level, TPS once again delivered solid orders and operating income, while OFE booked a solid orders quarter and OFS continued to improve margins. 
As we look to the second half of 2021 and into 2022, we see continued signs of global economic recovery that should drive further demand growth for oil and natural gas. Although we recognize the risks presented by the varying strengths of the COVID-19 virus, we believe that the oil price environment looks constructive with demand recovering and operators largely maintaining spending discipline. 
In the natural gas and LNG markets, fundamentals are equally as strong, if not better, than oil, as the combination of outages and strong demand in Asia, Latin America and Europe have driven third quarter LNG prices to levels not seen since 2015. Although hot weather in Europe and U.S. has contributed to solid demand improvement and lower gas storage levels, structural growth continues unabated in Asia with Chinese LNG imports up almost 30% in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2020. Given the strong pace of current growth and the increasing demand for cleaner sources of energy, we maintain our positive long-term outlook for natural gas and LNG. 
Outside of traditional oil and gas, the momentum for cleaner energy projects continues to increase around the world in the U.S., Europe and Asia, various projects around wind, solar and green and blue hydrogen are moving forward as well as a number of carbon capture projects. For example, so far this year, there have been 21 CCUS projects announced and in the early stages of development. compared to 19 CCUS projects announced in 2020. 
During the second quarter, we continued to build on a key pillar of our strategy to position for some of these new energy frontiers. Our team has moved quickly and decidedly in selected areas to establish relationships and build a strong foundation for future commercial success. Our approach has been one of collaboration and flexibility, which is reflected in the number of agreements we reached in the second quarter, ranging from early-stage partnerships and MOUs to more immediate investments, commercial agreements and tangible orders for Baker Hughes. 
Most recently, we announced a collaboration with Samsung Engineering for low to 0 carbon projects utilizing hydrogen and CCUS technologies. As part of the collaboration, we will work with Samsung Engineering to identify joint business development opportunities for Korean energy and industrial customers, domestically and abroad, to help reduce their emissions. 
Baker Hughes will look to deploy compression and NovaLT gas turbine technology as well as flexible pipes for transportation in hydrogen. In CCUS, we will be providing reservoir studies, well construction services, flexible pipes, condition monitoring solutions and certain auxiliary solutions such as carbon dioxide compression and liquefaction for key industrial assets. 
Another example of our early-stage partnerships is the collaboration agreement we reached with Bloom Energy on the potential commercialization and deployment of integrated low-carbon power generation and hydrogen solutions. This partnership will allow Baker Hughes to work with Bloom Energy across a number of areas, including integrated power solutions, integrated hydrogen solutions and other technical collaborations. 
Bloom Energy is a leading clean energy player with solid oxide fuel cell technology in natural gas and hydrogen and a growing electrolyzer presence. Through this agreement, we will gain further insights into fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies where Bloom has key offerings today and explore how we can integrate and utilize our world-class gas turbine and compression technology alongside these solutions. 
We were also very pleased to announce an MOU with bulk Borg CO2, a Norwegian carbon capture and storage developer to collaborate on a CCS project to serve as a hub for the decarbonization of industrial sites in the Viking region of Norway. Borg industrial cluster approach provides a great opportunity for Baker Hughes to test and scale our wide-ranging CCUS portfolio, including our chilled ammonia process and our compact carbon capture solution. This builds on our MOU with Horisont Energi for the Polaris carbon storage project in Norway announced last quarter. 
During the quarter, we also announced a 15% investment in electric -- to expand Baker's CCUS portfolio with power to gas and energy storage solutions. Baker Hughes will combine its post-combustion carbon capture technology with [ electric air's ] biomethanation technology to transform CO2 emissions into synthetic natural gas, a low carbon fuel capable of being used across multiple industries. 
Lastly, during the second quarter, we were extremely pleased to finalize our collaboration with Air Products, a global leader in hydrogen, to develop next-generation hydrogen compression and accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as a zero carbon fuel. As part of the collaboration, Baker Hughes will provide Air Products with advanced hydrogen compression and gas turbine technology for global projects. This includes NovaLT 16 gas turbines and compression equipment for their net zero hydrogen energy complex in Alberta, Canada. 
We will also provide advanced compression technology using our high-pressure ratio compressors at the Neom carbon-free hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. Through these 2 projects with Air Products, Baker Hughes will provide equipment on the world's largest blue and green hydrogen projects. 
As you can see from all these recent announcements, we feel confident in the momentum we're building in both CCUS and hydrogen spaces and believe that we have a differentiated technology offering that positions us as a leader in these areas. 
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, increases in activity levels became more broad-based during the second quarter, and the outlook for the second half of the year continues to improve. Internationally, we have seen a pickup in activity across multiple regions over the last few months, including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the North Sea. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect stronger growth across a broader range of markets, most notably in the Middle East and Russia. Based on discussions with our customers, we expect international activity to gain momentum over the second half of the year and lay the foundation for growth in 2022. 
In North America, strong second quarter growth was evenly distributed between our onshore and offshore business lines. Given the strength in oil prices and bid activity, we expect to see additional growth over the second half of the year. While we expect to capitalize on the growing improvement in global activity levels, we are committed to being disciplined through this up cycle with a focus on profitability and returns. This includes maintaining focus on our various cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives as well as navigating the inflation in supply chain costs, a situation that our team is managing well. As a result, OFS remains on track to achieve our goal of 20% EBITDA margins in the medium term. 
Moving to TPS. The outlook continues to improve driven by opportunities in LNG, onshore/offshore production, pumps and valves and new energy initiatives. While the order outlook for TPS in 2021 should be roughly consistent with 2020, we are growing increasingly confident that a multiyear growth opportunity will begin to emerge in 2022. Underpinning this framework is the strength that is developing in multiple parts of the TPS portfolio and the diversification of the business, which has commercial offerings in several end markets with high-growth opportunities. 
In LNG, we booked 2 awards during the second quarter with gas turbines and compressors for Train 7 at Nigeria LNG and  liquefaction equipment for new fortresses Energy's fast LNG project. Following these 2 orders, we still expect 1 or 2 more LNG awards in 2021 and see a strong pipeline of opportunities that should produce a step-up in LNG activity in 2022 and beyond. 
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, we were pleased to book awards in the Middle East and Asia Pacific in our refinery and pipeline and gas processing segments. TPS also secured a key industrial win with our NovaLT 12-megawatt gas turbine technology in the Middle East for a combined heat and power application. We continue to see our NovaLT range of gas turbines gain further traction for lower megawatt industrial applications. 
For TPS Services, we are beginning to see real signs of recovery and remain optimistic about the outlook for 2021 and 2022. In the second quarter, we experienced strong growth in service orders, which grew year-over-year due to the significant upgrade awards across multiple regions and for the various applications, including pipeline, offshore and solutions to support customers' operational decarbonization efforts. We also saw further improvements in transactional service orders as customers continue to increase spending. 
In our contractual services business, TPS maintained strategic long-term relationships with LNG customers, achieving a major milestone by securing a 6-year services contract extension in North America for a key producer, building on the success we saw in the first quarter. Our TPS services RPO now stands at close to $14.1 billion, which is up almost 10% year-over-year. 
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we remain focused on rightsizing the business, improving profitability and optimizing the portfolio in the face of what remains a challenged long-term offshore outlook. 
While Brent prices are near $70 and FID activity is beginning to pick up, we continue to expect only a modest improvement in industry subsea tree awards in 2021, followed by some additional growth in 2022. However, we continue to believe that it will be difficult to achieve and sustain 2019 order levels in the coming years as the deepwater market becomes increasingly concentrated into low-cost basins and upstream spending budgets for many larger operators are reallocated to other areas. 
However, one deepwater area that we expect to benefit from this environment is Brazil where the presold reserves are viewed as attractive by a number of IOCs. This quarter, our flexible business signed an important frame agreement with Petrobras for a number of pre and post-salt fields offshore Brazil. In the first half of 2021 and including the 2 contracts we were awarded in the first quarter, Petrobras has contracted Baker Hughes to provide up to 370 kilometers of flexible pipe. This is larger than the volume of flexible pipe awarded by Petrobras. to Baker Hughes in 2019 and 2020 combined. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, we were pleased to see orders continue to recover despite a challenging operating quarter. Year-over-year, growth in orders was led by strong performances in our industrial and transportation end markets. We saw continued traction in industrial end markets in the second quarter, which represented over 30% of DS' second quarter orders as we continue to grow our presence in this key area. 
During the quarter, DS continued to expand its industrial asset management presence with a number of wins across multiple end markets. Bently Nevada secured a contract with a large corrugated paper manufacturing company for its condition monitoring and protection solutions to optimize production and reduce maintenance costs. 
We were also pleased to see the recently acquired ARMS Reliability business to secure some industrial asset management orders during the quarter. including a subscription for its [ 1PM ] software to be deployed by a global chemicals customer with initial rollout in China and Chile. The deal will include software and consulting services to develop the customers' equipment liability strategy library, driving the deployment of best-in-class asset reliability strategies and real-time alignment for its assets. 
We're also having success integrating some of our emissions management solutions with our Bently Nevada business. This quarter, DS secured a Flare.IQ contract with BP, marking the first time Flare.IQ will be used in upstream oil and gas. This contract builds on our partnership with BP to measure and reduce their emissions across global flaring operations. Flare.IQ will be embedded into BP's existing System 1 condition monitoring software from Nevada, requiring no additional hardware for the customer. 
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to spend a few moments highlighting some of the achievements from our corporate responsibility report that was published at the end of the second quarter. This report provides an expanded view of our environmental, social and governance performance and outlines our corporate strategy and commitments for a sustainable energy future. 
For 2020, we achieved several notable milestones in our CR report. First, we continue to advance our reporting around sustainability and climate-related disclosures. This year, we included new reporting frameworks from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. 
Second, we again lowered our emissions footprint and expanded our emissions reporting. We achieved a 15% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions compared to 2019, and we reset our base year from 2012 to 2019 to account for corporate changes in line with the greenhouse gas protocol. Importantly, we also expanded our reporting of scope-free emissions to include new categories. 
And third, we made significant improvements in HSE performance and engagement during 2020. We increased our number of perfect HSE days to 200, reduced our total recordable incident rate by 18% and conducted more than 1 million HSE observations and leadership engagements globally. 
Overall, Baker Hughes is successfully executing on its vision to become an energy technology company and to take energy forward, making it safer, cleaner and more efficient for people and the planet. Our corporate responsibility report demonstrates our progress in many of these areas, while our second quarter results illustrate our progress towards our financial and strategic priorities. 
We believe that Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned in the coming years to deliver sector-leading free cash flow conversion while also building one of the most compelling energy transition growth stories. We will also continue to evaluate our portfolio in order to drive the best financial returns and create the most value for shareholders as the energy markets evolve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.1 billion, up 12% sequentially, driven by OFE, OFS and TPS partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-y",1649,"Thanks, Lorenzo. I will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.1 billion, up 12% sequentially, driven by OFE, OFS and TPS partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were up 4%, driven by increases in TPS and Digital Solutions, partially offset by decreases in OFE and OFS. Remaining performance obligation was $23.8 billion, up 3% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.6 billion, up 1% sequentially; and Services RPO ended at $16.2 billion, up 3% sequentially. 
Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.0, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 8% sequentially, with increases in all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was up 9%, driven by increases in TPS and DS, partially offset by decreases in OFE and OFS. 
Operating income for the quarter was $194 million. Adjusted operating income was $333 million, which excludes $139 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the second quarter primarily relate to projects previously announced in 2020. We expect to see restructuring and separation charges taper off through the second half of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 23% sequentially and $229 million year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 6.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 430 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $611 million, which excludes $139 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. Corporate costs were $111 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect corporate cost to be slightly down compared to second quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $278 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially. 
Net interest expense was $65 million, Net interest expense was down $9 million sequentially, primarily driven by onetime interest on tax credits. Also slightly reducing interest expense in the second quarter was the repayment of our U.K. short-dated commercial paper facility. For the third quarter, we expect interest expense to be roughly in line with first quarter levels. 
Income tax expense in the quarter was $143 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.08. Included in GAAP loss per share is a nonrecurring charge for a loss contingency related to certain tax matters. Also included are losses for the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai. These charges are recorded in other nonoperating income. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.10. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $385 million, Free cash flow for the second quarter includes $62 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are again particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the second quarter following the strength we saw in the first quarter. We have worked hard to improve our billing and cash collection process and have also updated the company's incentive structure with an increased focus on free cash flow, and we are pleased to see the performance so far this year. 
We have now generated $883 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which includes $170 million of cash restructuring and separation-related payments. For the total year, we believe that our free cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA should be around 50% given the capital efficiency of our portfolio and the winding down of the restructuring and separation costs. 
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a good quarter in an improving market environment. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially. International revenue was up 6% sequentially, led by increases in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. North American revenue increased 11% with solid growth in both our U.S. land and offshore businesses. 
Operating income was $171 million, up 20% sequentially and  margin rate expanded 80 basis points to 7.3% due to higher volume and lower depreciation. While we continue to execute on our cost-out program in the second quarter, this was partially offset by mix and cost inflation in some areas. Although we have moved quickly to pass inflation on to our customers, there is a timing lag relative to the increase in costs. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect to see strong sequential improvement in international activity and continued improvement in North America. As a result, we expect sequential revenue growth for OFS in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. On the margin side, we expect the sequential increase in operating margin rate to solidly exceed the improvement in the second quarter due to more favorable mix and better cost recovery. 
For the full year 2021, our industry outlook remains largely intact with second half activity in North America modestly better than previously expected. Overall, we still expect our OFS revenue to be down slightly year-over-year with North American revenues roughly flat and international revenue down mid-single digits. On the margin side, we continue to expect growth in operating income and margin rates on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $681 million, down 3% year-over-year and up 97% sequentially. Strong year-over-year growth in Subsea Services and flexibles orders was offset by declines in [ SPC ] projects and Subsea Production Systems. The sequential improvement in orders was driven by an increase in orders in SPS along with several orders and flexibles outside of Brazil. 
Revenue was $637 million, down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in subsea drilling systems and the disposition of SPC flow partially offset by growth in flexibles. Operating income was $28 million, which is up $42 million year-over-year. This was driven by increased volumes in flexibles as well as productivity from our cost-out programs. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating margin rate in the low single digits. 
For the full year 2021, we believe the offshore markets will remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a lower order environment in 2021. Although revenue is likely to be down in 2021, we expect to generate positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should continue to offset the decline in volumes. 
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 8% year-over-year. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by LNG awards for Nigeria LNG Train 7 and for New Fortress Energy's fast LNG project. We were also pleased to book a number of non-LNG awards, specifically in our refinery and petrochemical and industrial segments. 
Service orders in the quarter were up 20% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially, primarily driven by increases in upgrades and transactional services. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 40% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up almost 90% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was up 14% versus the prior year. 
Operating income for TPS was $220 million, up 48% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and continued execution on cost productivity partially offset by a higher equipment mix. Operating margin was 13.5%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to be very pleased with the TPS margin rate improvement, particularly as our equipment revenue mix has increased from 36% to 48% year-over-year. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase modestly on a sequential basis based on expected equipment backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to improve modestly on a sequential basis. For the full year 2021, we expect TPS to generate strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by equipment backlog conversion and growth in TPS services. Despite a higher mix of equipment revenue, we now expect TPS margin rates to slightly improve year-over-year. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $540 million, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in orders in industrial and transportation offset by declines in power. Sequentially, orders were down 2%, driven by declines in power and oil and gas, partially offset by improvements in transportation and industrial. Revenue for the quarter was $520 million, up 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volumes in PPS and Waygate, offset by lower volume in Nexus Controls. Sequentially, revenue was up 11%, driven by a higher order intake in the first quarter of 2021. 
Operating income for the quarter was $25 million, down 39% year-over-year largely driven by costs related to a legacy software contract that we do not expect to repeat. Sequentially, operating income was up 3%, driven by higher volume. 
For the third quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the high single digits. For the full year 2021, we still expect modest growth in revenue on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With lower margins in the first half of the year and higher volumes over the second half, we expect DS margin rates to be in the high single digits on a full year basis. 
Overall, we delivered a solid quarter and continued strong free cash flow. While we faced challenges in our DS business, we are confident in our ability to execute as the rest of the year unfolds. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

And really, it's for a prolonged growth cycle of orders and EBITDA. As you look at the near term to immediate term, it's really going to be LNG and the orders that we've seen. You can also see the small awards we booked this year. We still see some other -- maybe 1 or 2 small projects being awarded this year. But as we go forward, the next 2 to 3 years, we see a step-up in LNG order opportunity, as been highlighted by the increasing demand and also what we announced previously for the long-term outlook of LNG out to 2030. 
Then as you go longer term, also the next 5 to 10 years, we expect to see significant growth around our energy transition initiatives, most notably hydrogen, CCUS but also in areas like valves, integrated power as the clean energy ecosystem continues to evolve. 
And I think as you look at our recent announcements with Air Products that was given, we see some near-term opportunities for hydrogen. And those will actually be additional awards over the course of the next 2 to 3 years as a first wave but continuing through the rest of the decade. 
And CCUS, you looked at our announcement with Borg and Horisont Energi, and we're in a number of active collaborations with our customers across several geographies of increasing opportunities around CCUS. And lastly, our service business, it's got solid growth potential for the next 10 years when you look at the installed base as well as the upgrade opportunities. I think with LNG growing about -- our installed base would grow by about 30% by 2025 with the increasing tonnage of LNG. And then you look also going forward with what we announced, our TPS services RPO now standing at $14.1 billion, which is up from $13 billion a year ago. So good signs of continued growth on the services side."

As I mentioned, the teams have done a great job in changing a lot of processes. And so look, our view really on capital allocation hasn't really changed. But as you pointed out, the pace of our free cash flow is improving, particularly as restructuring is winding down over the rest of this year. So that's a big capital allocation action that won't be repeating there. So it leaves us, I think, in a position to have quite a bit more optionality. 
We're primarily focused on investing in areas where we see the ability to grow offerings frontiers like energy transition and digital as well as some interesting places in industrial technologies. And you've seen some of those examples like C3.ai, Compact Carbon Capture and, more recently, ARMS Reliability. And look, I'd say beyond some small-scale acquisitions and investments in some of the new energy frontiers, share repurchases could certainly be an attractive piece of the capital allocation portfolio view. And the pace that we're generating free cash flow certainly gives us more optionality to evaluate that. and continue to look at ways to return value to shareholders. So look, we will keep you guys updated as we're evaluating that, and it's good to have this flexibility."

And we're seeing strong growth in upgrades with recovery across regions and various applications, pipeline, offshore, solutions also to support our customers on the operational decarbonization efforts with the upgrades that we can provide them. And you saw the double-digit growth in transactional services in the quarter as customers are returning to normalized spending levels. And also, we've got a solid CSA revenue stream that's been resilient.

Now the pricing that we're talking about here is really to offset some of the inflation that we're seeing. So we're not counting on any pricing increases to drive that margin improvement. But if we can get those pricing increases to stick and hold inflation levels down, I think that could provide some upside. So it's been a fundamental change in how that business is operating, how Maria Claudia and the team are leading it and how we're allocating capital. And that's really what's driving the improvement here, and we're making it fundamental and long lasting."

People are starting to look and people starting to buy into the cycle start to pick up. Now Baker Hughes has a very different business portfolio than your peers. So I was just wondering maybe you could just kind of talk about kind of over the next 2 to 3 years, maybe helping people understand what parts of your business do you think are going to have more pronounced growth and margin expansion? Really, I guess what I'm asking, what parts do you expect to outperform over the next 2, 3 years as the cycle accelerates? And I guess I'm just sort of thinking about your 4 segments and how you sort of see them kind of progressing here."

And in our last call, we mentioned the addressable markets of hydrogen by 2030 being $25 billion to $30 billion and CCUS being $35 billion to $40 billion for Baker Hughes. So clearly, as you look at the macro picture, the long-term growth prospects of our TPS business look very solid. 
Also, in the short term, with the continued rebound in some of the upstream and also the production side, Oilfield Services continuing to perform well. So short term, you'll see that pick up in longer term the TPS business continues to have a good future."

But what I'd say is our goal -- and what I think the capability of this portfolio is to generate free cash flow conversion at the 50% level or higher. I think if you look at next year, probably the biggest variable that you probably know that you pointed out is really working capital as we're early in the cycle for OFS. And the working capital intensity will really be driven by that pace of growth. And then if I step back and look at some of the other factors for next year, look, we'd expect to see EBITDA continue to grow on higher revenues and the continued focus around productivity. CapEx in absolute terms will be higher but, as a percent of revenue, should be in the same range as it's been the last couple of years in that 3.5% to 4% range. 
Taxes will likely be higher because of the refunds that we've gotten this year. And then you pointed out restructuring and separation charges will go away. And so that's roughly $200 million, which should contribute to material improvement in free cash flow. So that 50% level is certainly what this portfolio is capable of, and we're going to keep driving it higher."

And again, we do see a solid step-up in growth internationally over the second half of the year. So far this year, we've seen strong recovery in Latin America, North Sea, Southeast Asia. The Middle East has somewhat lagged, but we expect incremental stronger activity over the course of the second half and into 2022 as well as in Russia being bigger contributors to the second half as well. So we've been somewhat more conservative in forecasting international activity. I think you know that it really depends on how some of the regions come back. Right now, we think our growth in the second half of the year could be in the high single digits or low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that momentum to continue into 2022 with solid growth opportunities. 
North America, we generally expect the rig count to continue to trend a little higher over the second half, maybe adding an additional 50 rigs or so by the end of the year. So that would imply a modest improvement in the third quarter and fourth quarter. When you look at 2022, again, we anticipate solid growth with the prices holding at the range they are now. But similar to this year, we expect some of the privates to be active and -- at these prices but some of the public E&Ps also will continue to be only increasing their spending modestly as they continue to adjust some of their operating cash flow to some of the other areas of capital spending."

So we're providing the different solutions because there's no one solution that's going to be for everybody. And like in LNG, we want to be able to provide capabilities for small, medium and large scale as they get undertaken. 
Specifically on Borg, the Borg MOU announcement allows us again to really play at the forefront of capturing and storing up to 630,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, and they're going to be utilizing our technology to do that. And we're also going to be able to see an industrial cluster approach.

And we were disappointed in the margin rate, which was really a function of project delays for this legacy software contract. And just to clarify, this legacy software contract goes back several years and isn't associated with our C3.ai partnership. And so this resulted in some higher cost and not revenue here in the quarter, and that was the biggest driver. I will note it was a little bit of incremental costs we had in the R&D front in DS this quarter related to some strategic areas like the ARMS Reliability acquisition that we did earlier in the year and some -- the acceleration of some work we were doing around emissions management. 
And I'd say looking ahead in the third and fourth quarters, I don't expect the overall level of cost in DS to be at the levels that you saw here in the second quarter. So we do think the business is going to be back on track to generate higher margins with the volume growth that we're seeing in cost levels back to lower levels to support those higher margin rates."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow, booked several key awards and took a number of positive steps in our journey to grow our new energy businesses. At a product",2340,"Thank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the second quarter, we generated strong free cash flow, booked several key awards and took a number of positive steps in our journey to grow our new energy businesses. At a product company level, TPS once again delivered solid orders and operating income, while OFE booked a solid orders quarter and OFS continued to improve margins.  
As we look to the second half of 2021 and into 2022, we see continued signs of global economic recovery that should drive further demand growth for oil and natural gas. Although we recognize the risks presented by the varying strengths of the COVID-19 virus, we believe that the oil price environment looks constructive with demand recovering and operators largely maintaining spending discipline.  
In the natural gas and LNG markets, fundamentals are equally as strong, if not better, than oil, as the combination of outages and strong demand in Asia, Latin America and Europe have driven third quarter LNG prices to levels not seen since 2015. Although hot weather in Europe and U.S. has contributed to solid demand improvement and lower gas storage levels, structural growth continues unabated in Asia, with Chinese LNG imports up almost 30% in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2020.  
Given the strong pace of current growth and the increasing demand for cleaner sources of energy, we maintain our positive long-term outlook for natural gas and LNG. Outside of traditional oil and gas, the momentum for cleaner energy projects continues to increase around the world. In the U.S., Europe and Asia, various projects around wind, solar and green and blue hydrogen are moving forward as well as a number of carbon capture projects. For example, so far this year, there have been 21 CCUS projects announced and in the early stages of development compared to 19 CCUS projects announced in 2020.  
During the second quarter, we continued to build on a key pillar of our strategy to position for some of these new energy frontiers. Our team has moved quickly and decidedly in selected areas to establish relationships and build a strong foundation for future commercial success. Our approach has been one of collaboration and flexibility, which is reflected in the number of agreements we reached in the second quarter, ranging from early-stage partnerships and MOUs to more immediate investments, commercial agreements and tangible orders for Baker Hughes.  
Most recently, we announced a collaboration with Samsung Engineering for low to 0 carbon projects utilizing hydrogen and CCUS technologies. As part of the collaboration, we will work with Samsung Engineering to identify joint business development opportunities for Korean energy and industrial customers, domestically and abroad, to help reduce their emissions.  
Baker Hughes will look to deploy compression and NovaLT gas turbine technology as well as flexible pipes for transportation in hydrogen. In CCUS, we will be providing reservoir studies, well construction services, flexible pipes, condition monitoring solutions and certain auxiliary solutions such as carbon dioxide compression and liquefaction for key industrial assets.  
Another example of our early-stage partnerships is the collaboration agreement we reached with Bloom Energy on the potential commercialization and deployment of integrated low-carbon power generation and hydrogen solutions. This partnership will allow Baker Hughes to work with Bloom Energy across a number of areas, including integrated power solutions, integrated hydrogen solutions and other technical collaborations.  
Bloom Energy is a leading clean energy player with solid oxide fuel cell technology in natural gas and hydrogen and a growing electrolyzer presence. Through this agreement, we will gain further insights into fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies where Bloom has key offerings today and explore how we can integrate and utilize our world-class gas cabin and compression technology alongside these solutions.  
We were also very pleased to announce an MOU with Borg CO2, a Norwegian carbon capture and storage developer to collaborate on a CCS project to serve as a hub for the decarbonization of industrial sites in the Viking region of Norway. Borg industrial cluster approach provides a great opportunity for Baker Hughes to test and scale our wide-ranging CCUS portfolio, including our chilled ammonia process and our compact carbon capture solution. This builds on our MOU with Horisont Energi for the Polaris carbon storage project in Norway announced last quarter.  
During the quarter, we also announced a 15% investment in Electrochaea to expand Baker Hughes' CCUS portfolio with power to gas and energy storage solutions. Baker Hughes will combine its post-combustion carbon capture technology with Electrochaea's bio-methanation technology to transform CO2 emissions into synthetic natural gas, a low carbon fuel capable of being used across multiple industries.  
Lastly, during the second quarter, we were extremely pleased to finalize our collaboration with Air Products, a global leader in hydrogen, to develop next-generation hydrogen compression and accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as a zero carbon fuel. As part of the collaboration, Baker Hughes will provide Air Products with advanced hydrogen compression and gas turbine technology for global projects. This includes NovaLT16 gas turbines and compression equipment for their net zero hydrogen energy complex in Alberta, Canada.  
We will also provide advanced compression technology using our high-pressure ratio compressors at the NEOM carbon-free hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. Through these 2 projects with Air Products, Baker Hughes will provide equipment on the world's largest blue and green hydrogen projects.  
As you can see from all these recent announcements, we feel confident in the momentum we're building in both CCUS and hydrogen spaces and believe that we have a differentiated technology offering that positions us as a leader in these areas.  
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, increases in activity levels became more broad-based during the second quarter, and the outlook for the second half of the year continues to improve. Internationally, we have seen a pickup in activity across multiple regions over the last few months, including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the North Sea. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect stronger growth across a broader range of markets, most notably in the Middle East and Russia.  
Based on discussions with our customers, we expect international activity to gain momentum over the second half of the year and lay the foundation for growth in 2022.  
In North America, strong second quarter growth was evenly distributed between our onshore and offshore business lines. Given the strength in oil prices and bid activity, we expect to see additional growth over the second half of the year. While we expect to capitalize on the growing improvement in global activity levels, we are committed to being disciplined through this up cycle with a focus on profitability and returns. This includes maintaining focus on our various cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives as well as navigating the inflation in supply chain costs, a situation that our team is managing well. As a result, OFS remains on track to achieve our goal of 20% EBITDA margins in the medium term.  
Moving to TPS. The outlook continues to improve driven by opportunities in LNG, onshore/offshore production, pumps and valves and new energy initiatives. While the order outlook for TPS in 2021 should be roughly consistent with 2020, we are growing increasingly confident that a multiyear growth opportunity will begin to emerge in 2022. Underpinning this framework is the strength that is developing in multiple parts of the TPS portfolio and the diversification of the business, which has commercial offerings in several end markets with high-growth opportunities.  
In LNG, we booked 2 awards during the second quarter with gas turbines and compressors for Train 7 at Nigeria LNG and liquefaction equipment for New Fortress Energy’s Fast LNG project. Following these 2 orders, we still expect 1 or 2 more LNG awards in 2021 and see a strong pipeline of opportunities that should produce a step-up in LNG activity in 2022 and beyond.  
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, we were pleased to book awards in the Middle East and Asia Pacific in our refinery and pipeline and gas processing segments. TPS also secured a key industrial win with our NovaLT 12-megawatt gas turbine technology in the Middle East for a combined heat and power application. We continue to see our NovaLT range of gas turbines gain further traction for lower megawatt industrial applications.  
For TPS Services, we are beginning to see real signs of recovery and remain optimistic about the outlook for 2021 and 2022. In the second quarter, we experienced strong growth in service orders, which grew year-over-year due to the significant upgrade awards across multiple regions and for the various applications, including pipeline, offshore and solutions to support customers' operational decarbonization efforts.  
We also saw further improvements in transactional service orders as customers continue to increase spending. In our contractual services business, TPS maintained strategic long-term relationships with LNG customers, achieving a major milestone by securing a 6-year services contract extension in North America for a key producer, building on the success we saw in the first quarter.  Our TPS services RPO now stands at close to $14.1 billion, which is up almost 10% year-over-year.  
Next on Oilfield Equipment. We remain focused on rightsizing the business, improving profitability and optimizing the portfolio in the face of what remains a challenged long-term offshore outlook. While Brent prices are near $70 and FID activity is beginning to pick up, we continue to expect only a modest improvement in industry Subsea tree awards in 2021, followed by some additional growth in 2022. However, we continue to believe that it will be difficult to achieve and sustain 2019 order levels in the coming years as the deepwater market becomes increasingly concentrated into low-cost basins and upstream spending budgets for many larger operators are reallocated to other areas.  
However, one deepwater area that we expect to benefit from this environment is Brazil where the presold reserves are viewed as attractive by a number of IOCs. This quarter, our flexible business signed an important frame agreement with Petrobras for a number of pre and post-salt fields offshore Brazil. In the first half of 2021 and including the 2 contracts we were awarded in the first quarter, Petrobras has contracted Baker Hughes to provide up to 370 kilometers of flexible pipe. This is larger than the volume of flexible pipe awarded by Petrobras to Baker Hughes in 2019 and 2020, combined.  
Finally in Digital Solutions. We were pleased to see orders continue to recover despite a challenging operating quarter. Year-over-year, growth in orders was led by strong performances in our industrial and transportation end markets. We saw continued traction in industrial end markets in the second quarter, which represented over 30% of DS' second quarter orders as we continue to grow our presence in this key area.  
During the quarter, DS continued to expand its industrial asset management presence with a number of wins across multiple end markets. Bently Nevada secured a contract with a large corrugated paper manufacturing company for its condition monitoring and protection solutions to optimize production and reduce maintenance costs.  
We were also pleased to see the recently acquired ARMS Reliability business to [ sure ] some industrial asset management orders during the quarter, including a subscription for its OnePM software to be deployed by a global chemicals customer with initial rollout in China and Chile. The deal will include software and consulting services to develop the customers' equipment liability strategy library, driving the deployment of best-in-class asset reliability strategies and real-time alignment for its assets.  
We're also having success integrating some of our emissions management solutions with our Bently Nevada business. This quarter, DS secured a flare.IQ contract with BP, marking the first time flare.IQ will be used in upstream oil and gas. This contract builds on our partnership with BP to measure and reduce their emissions across global flaring operations. flare.IQ will be embedded into BP's existing [ System 1 ] condition monitoring software from Nevada, requiring no additional hardware for the customer.  
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to spend a few moments highlighting some of the achievements from our corporate responsibility report that was published at the end of the second quarter. This report provides an expanded view of our environmental, social and governance performance and outlines our corporate strategy and commitments for a sustainable energy future.  
For 2020, we achieved several notable milestones in our CR report. First, we continue to advance our reporting around sustainability and climate-related disclosures. This year, we included new reporting frameworks from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. Second, we again lowered our emissions footprint and expanded our emissions reporting. We achieved a 15% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions compared to 2019, and we reset our base year from 2012 to 2019 to account for corporate changes in line with the greenhouse gas protocol. Importantly, we also expanded our reporting of scope-free emissions to include new categories. And third, we made significant improvements in HSE performance and engagement during 2020. We increased our number of perfect HSE days to 200, reduced our total recordable incident rate by 18% and conducted more than 1 million HSE observations and leadership engagements globally.  
Overall, Baker Hughes is successfully executing on its vision to become an energy technology company and to take energy forward, making it safer, cleaner and more efficient for people and the planet. Our corporate responsibility report demonstrates our progress in many of these areas, while our second quarter results illustrate our progress towards our financial and strategic priorities.  
We believe that Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned in the coming years to deliver sector-leading free cash flow conversion while also building one of the most compelling energy transition growth stories. We will also continue to evaluate our portfolio in order to drive the best financial returns and create the most value for shareholders as the energy markets evolve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.1 billion, up 12% sequentially, driven by OFE, OFS and TPS partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were up 4%, driven by increases in TPS and Digital Solutions, partially offset by decreases in OFE and OFS. Remaining performance obligation was $23.8 billion, up 3% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.6 billion, up 1% sequentially; and Services RPO ended at $16.2 billion, up 3% sequentially. 
Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.0, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.9. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 8% sequentially, with increases in all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was up 9%, driven by increases in TPS and DS, partially offset by decreases in OFE and OFS. 
Operating income for the quarter was $194 million. Adjusted operating income was $333 million, which excludes $139 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the second quarter primarily relate to projects previously announced in 2020. We expect to see restructuring and separation charges taper off through the second half of the year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 23% sequentially and $229 million year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 6.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 430 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $611 million, which excludes $139 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. Corporate costs were $111 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect corporate cost to be slightly down compared to second quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $278 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially. 
Net interest expense was $65 million. Net interest expense was down $9 million sequentially, primarily driven by onetime interest on tax credits. Also slightly reducing interest expense in the second quarter was the repayment of our U.K. short-dated commercial paper facility. For the third quarter, we expect interest expense to be roughly in line with first quarter levels. 
Income tax expense in the quarter was $143 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.08. Included in GAAP loss per share is a nonrecurring charge for a loss contingency related to certain tax matters. Also included are losses for the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai. These charges are recorded in other nonoperating income. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.10. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $385 million. Free cash flow for the second quarter includes $62 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are again particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the second quarter, following the strength we saw in the first quarter. We have worked hard to improve our billing and cash collection process and have also updated the company's incentive structure with an increased focus on free cash flow, and we are pleased to see the performance so far this year. 
We have now generated $883 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which includes $170 million of cash restructuring and separation-related payments. For the total year, we believe that our free cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA should be around 50% given the capital efficiency of our portfolio and the winding down of the restructuring and separation costs. 
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a good quarter in an improving market environment. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 7% sequentially. International revenue was up 6% sequentially, led by increases in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America. North American revenue increased 11% with solid growth in both our U.S. land and offshore businesses. 
Operating income was $171 million, up 20% sequentially and  margin rate expanded 80 basis points to 7.3% due to higher volume and lower depreciation. While we continue to execute on our cost-out program in the second quarter, this was partially offset by mix and cost inflation in some areas. Although we have moved quickly to pass inflation on to our customers, there is a timing lag relative to the increase in costs. 
As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect to see strong sequential improvement in international activity and continued improvement in North America. As a result, we expect sequential revenue growth for OFS in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. On the margin side, we expect the sequential increase in operating margin rate to solidly exceed the improvement in the second quarter due to more favorable mix and better cost recovery. 
For the full year 2021, our industry outlook remains largely intact with second half activity in North America modestly better than previously expected. Overall, we still expect our OFS revenue to be down slightly year-over-year with North American revenues roughly flat and international revenue down mid-single digits. On the margin side, we continue to expect growth in operating income and margin rates on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $681 million, down 3% year-over-year and up 97% sequentially. Strong year-over-year growth in Subsea Services and flexibles orders was offset by declines in SPC Projects and Subsea Production Systems. The sequential improvement in orders was driven by an increase in orders in SPS along with several orders in flexibles outside of Brazil. 
Revenue was $637 million, down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in subsea drilling systems and the disposition of SPC flow, partially offset by growth in flexibles. Operating income was $28 million, which is up $42 million year-over-year. This was driven by increased volumes in flexibles as well as productivity from our cost-out programs. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by lower SPS and flexibles backlog conversion. We expect operating margin rate in the low single digits. 
For the full year 2021, we believe the offshore markets will remain challenged as operators reassess their portfolios and project selection. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits on a year-over-year basis due to the lower order intake in 2020 and a likely continuation of a lower order environment in 2021. Although revenue is likely to be down in 2021, we expect to generate positive operating income as our cost-out efforts should continue to offset the decline in volumes. 
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 8% year-over-year. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by LNG awards for Nigeria LNG Train 7 and for New Fortress Energy's FAST LNG project. We were also pleased to book a number of non-LNG awards, specifically in our refinery and petrochemical and industrial segments. 
Service orders in the quarter were up 20% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially, primarily driven by increases in upgrades and transactional services. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 40% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up almost 90% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog. Services revenue was up 14% versus the prior year. 
Operating income for TPS was $220 million, up 48% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and continued execution on cost productivity, partially offset by a higher equipment mix. Operating margin was 13.5%, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to be very pleased with the TPS margin rate improvement, particularly as our equipment revenue mix has increased from 36% to 48% year-over-year. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase modestly on a sequential basis based on expected equipment backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to improve modestly on a sequential basis. For the full year 2021, we expect TPS to generate strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by equipment backlog conversion and growth in TPS services. Despite a higher mix of equipment revenue, we now expect TPS margin rates to slightly improve year-over-year. 
Finally in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $540 million, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strong growth in orders in industrial and transportation, offset by declines in power. Sequentially, orders were down 2%, driven by declines in power and oil and gas, partially offset by improvements in transportation and industrial. Revenue for the quarter was $520 million, up 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volumes in PPS and Waygate, offset by lower volume in Nexus Controls. Sequentially, revenue was up 11%, driven by a higher order intake in the first quarter of 2021. 
Operating income for the quarter was $25 million, down 39% year-over-year largely driven by costs related to a legacy software contract that we do not expect to repeat. Sequentially, operating income was up 3%, driven by higher volume. 
For the third quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the high single digits. For the full year 2021, we still expect modest growth in revenue on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by a recovery in industrial end markets. With lower margins in the first half of the year and higher volumes over the second half, we expect DS margin rates to be in the high single digits on a full year basis. 
Overall, we delivered a solid quarter and continued strong free cash flow. While we faced challenges in our DS business, we are confident in our ability to execute as the rest of the year unfolds. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

And really, it's for a prolonged growth cycle of orders and EBITDA. As you look at the near term to immediate term, it's really going to be LNG and the orders that we've seen. You can also see the small awards we booked this year. We still see some other -- maybe 1 or 2 small projects being awarded this year. But as we go forward, the next 2 to 3 years, we see a step-up in LNG order opportunity, as been highlighted by the increasing demand and also what we announced previously for the long-term outlook of LNG out to 2030. 
Then as you go longer term, also the next 5 to 10 years, we expect to see significant growth around our energy transition initiatives, most notably hydrogen, CCUS but also in areas like valves, integrated power as the clean energy ecosystem continues to evolve. 
And I think as you look at our recent announcements with Air Products that was given, we see some near-term opportunities for hydrogen. And those will actually be additional awards over the course of the next 2 to 3 years as a first wave but continuing through the rest of the decade. 
And CCUS, you looked at our announcement with Borg and Horisont Energi, and we're in a number of active collaborations with our customers across several geographies of increasing opportunities around CCUS. And lastly, our service business, it's got solid growth potential for the next 10 years when you look at the installed base as well as the upgrade opportunities. I think with LNG growing about -- our installed base would grow by about 30% by 2025 with the increasing tonnage of LNG. And then you look also going forward with what we announced, our TPS services RPO now standing at $14.1 billion, which is up from $13 billion a year ago. So good signs of continued growth on the services side."

As I mentioned, the teams have done a great job in changing a lot of processes. And so look, our view really on capital allocation hasn't really changed. But as you pointed out, the pace of our free cash flow is improving, particularly as restructuring is winding down over the rest of this year. So that's a big capital allocation action that won't be repeating there. So it leaves us, I think, in a position to have quite a bit more optionality. 
We're primarily focused on investing in areas where we see the ability to grow offerings and new frontiers like energy transition and digital as well as some interesting places in industrial technologies. And you've seen some of those examples like C3.ai, Compact Carbon Capture and, more recently, ARMS Reliability. And look, I'd say beyond some small-scale acquisitions and investments in some of the new energy frontiers, share repurchases could certainly be an attractive piece of the capital allocation portfolio view. And the pace that we're generating free cash flow certainly gives us more optionality to evaluate that. And continue to look at ways to return value to shareholders. So look, we will keep you guys updated as we're evaluating that, and it's good to have this flexibility."

And we're seeing strong growth in upgrades with recovery across regions and various applications, pipeline, offshore, solutions also to support our customers on the operational decarbonization efforts with the upgrades that we can provide them. And you saw the double-digit growth in transactional services in the quarter as customers are returning to normalized spending levels. And also, we've got a solid CSA revenue stream that's been resilient. So overall, we think we could be reasonably that closer to a 2019-type level. in 2022 with the continued upgrade and transactional activity continuing strongly as we go forward."

And this is maybe an area that we haven't discussed much before, but we really see synthetic natural gas as being applicable to multiple industries and Electrochaea technology allows CO2 recycling into grid quality, low carbon synthetic natural gas, which helps to drive decarbonization in the hearts for both sectors such as transportation and heating.

And look, we have seen some traction there and started to see some pricing power come back across the portfolio, not everywhere, but we're certainly seeing that capability. 
We did get some price in the second quarter. But as I mentioned, it takes a little while longer for some of that to kick in versus the inputs that are coming in. So look, I'd say over the course of this year, we'll continue to push that and try to make sure that the price increases are offsetting as much of the inflation as possible. 
The one thing I would point out, too, is that look, we've got a global supply chain. We've got pretty good contractual arrangements in place and have been working with our suppliers as we started to see this coming through to mute some of the impact this year. Obviously, you have some hedges in place as well and really focused on looking at 2022 and making sure we're securing things for next year as well.

David, look, we're not counting on a significant mix shift to be able to deliver that level of margin. Sure. If some of the product lines that have higher margin rates get more tailwinds, that will certainly help. But we've taken the approach of driving improvement across the entire business. We've done a lot around remote operations. We multiskilled the workforce to be able to deploy them in different ways, and more effectively, we've made massive changes inside the supply chain and in our service shops, and you've seen us take a lot of cost out with the restructuring. And so a lot of those process improvements and cost out are going to continue, and that's really what's going to drive the margin rate. So the actions have already been launched, and the team is certainly executing on those. 
Now the pricing that we're talking about here is really to offset some of the inflation that we're seeing. So we're not counting on any pricing increases to drive that margin improvement. But if we can get those pricing increases to stick and hold inflation levels down, I think that could provide some upside. So it's been a fundamental change in how that business is operating, how Maria Claudia and the team are leading it and how we're allocating capital.

I think if you look at next year, probably the biggest variable that you probably know that you pointed out is really working capital as we're early in the cycle for OFS. And the working capital intensity will really be driven by that pace of growth. 
And then if I step back and look at some of the other factors for next year, look, we'd expect to see EBITDA continue to grow on higher revenues and we continued focus around productivity. CapEx in absolute terms will be higher but, as a percent of revenue, should be in the same range as it's been the last couple of years in that 3.5% to 4% range. 
Taxes will likely be higher because of the refunds that we've gotten this year. And then you pointed out restructuring and separation charges will go away. And so that's roughly $200 million, which should contribute to material improvement in free cash flow.

So we've been somewhat more conservative in forecasting international activity. I think you know that it really depends on how some of the regions come back. Right now, we think our growth in the second half of the year could be in the high single digits or low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that momentum to continue into 2022 with solid growth opportunities. 
North America, we generally expect the rig count to continue to trend a little higher over the second half, maybe adding an additional 50 rigs or so by the end of the year. So that would imply a modest improvement in the third quarter and fourth quarter. When you look at 2022, again, we anticipate solid growth with the prices holding at the range they are now.

Specifically on Borg. The Borg MOU announcement allows us again to really play at the forefront of capturing and storing up to 630,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, and they're going to be utilizing our technology to do that.

And just to clarify, this legacy software contract goes back several years and isn't associated with our C3.ai partnership. And so this resulted in some higher cost and not revenue here in the quarter, and that was the biggest driver. I will note, it was a little bit of incremental costs we had in the R&D front in DS this quarter related to some strategic areas like the ARMS Reliability acquisition that we did earlier in the year and some -- the acceleration of some work we were doing around emissions management. 
And I'd say looking ahead in the third and fourth quarters, I don't expect the overall level of cost in DS to be at the levels that you saw here in the second quarter. So we do think the business is going to be back on track to generate higher margins with the volume growth that we're seeing in cost levels back to lower levels to support those higher margin rates."

And we're very pleased to be collaborating with Bloom on a number of customer engagements, which really are going to come to the forefront over the course of the next 2 to 3 years on really looking at the way in which we can provide integrated power solutions and also the way in which we can provide integrated hydrogen solutions. So I think you may know that Bloom Energy is a leading player in solid oxide fuel cells. And really, it enables us to provide our technology of lightweight gas turbine technology within their proficient solid oxide fuel cells to really enable integrated power solutions for customers that are looking to be independent of the grid. We've got the NovaLT gas turbines. So we're looking at opportunities of combining there. 
And then on the integrated hydrogen solutions, they've got an increasing portfolio on electrolyzer cells that can produce 100% clean hydrogen. And with our compression technology, we think we can provide really an efficient production and also transport of hydrogen and usage, again with our 100% NovaLT gas turbines that can run on hydrogen and our compression capability. So it's an evolving space here, and we think a lot of good opportunities as the energy transition continues."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the way the team has continued to execute on our strategy over the course of the third quarter.

We are pleased with the way the team has continued to execute on our strategy over the course of the third quarter. At the total company level, we had a strong orders quarter, grew adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income margin rate sequentially and year-over-year and had another solid quarter of free cash flow. 
While we did experience some mixed results across our product companies, on the positive side,  TPS generated strong orders, operating income and margin rates, and OFE had a solid orders quarter. On the more challenging side, our OFS business was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida, cost inflation in our chemicals business and delivery issues stemming from supply chain constraints, while DS also faced supply chain delays that impacted product deliveries. 
As we look at the macro environment, the global economy continues to recover. However, the pace of growth is being hampered by lingering effects from the COVID-19 Delta variant, global chip shortages, supply chain issues and energy supply constraints in multiple parts of the world. Despite these headwinds, global growth appears to be on a relatively solid footing, underpinning a favorable outlook for the oil market, aided by continued spending discipline by the world's largest producers. 
In the natural gas and LNG markets, fundamentals remain strong with a combination of solid demand growth and extremely tight supply in many parts of the world. In fact, we believe the positive case for structural demand growth in natural gas as part of the broader energy transition is becoming increasingly evident. 
The current environment illustrates the need for policymakers to focus on the utilization of natural gas as a baseload fuel that can be combined with renewable energy sources to provide a cleaner, safer, more affordable and more reliable source of energy to populations around the world. 
A number of developed economies have had great success over the last 10 to 15 years, lowering their carbon emissions by switching from coal to natural gas. However, some policy scenarios have seen a more rapid conversion straight to renewables, which limits the role of natural gas as a transition fuel and can lead to broader grid instability. We believe that there is a strong and logical combination of a secure, stable baseload of natural gas that is needed to complement renewable energy sources and, in turn, offset intermittencies. 
As you can see from recent events, the cost of moving too aggressively are beginning to surface, as multiple parts of the world are experiencing energy shortages, unprecedented increases in energy prices and shutdowns and brownouts across multiple industries. The increase in natural gas prices has been most acute due to a number of factors, including underinvestment in gas reserves, a decline in contribution from hydroelectric and renewable power and continued increases in energy demand. Ironically, the [ falloff ] from higher prices has also led to an increase in coal consumption, leading to coal shortages and a spike in coal prices. 
Natural gas has been a key contributor to lowering emissions in the United States over the last 15 years as power generation consumption switched from coal to natural gas. U.S. power consumption of natural gas has increased from around 16% of total generation to roughly 40% over the past 20 years, while coal consumption has declined from over 50% of the energy supply mix to approximately 25% over the same period. By comparison, today, roughly 60% of Asia Pacific's power generation comes from coal and about 10% from natural gas. 
As more countries step up their carbon reduction commitments, we believe that natural gas will play a critical role in displacing higher emission sources like coal and by supporting the growth in renewable energy technologies with relatively cheaper and affordable baseload power. 
Natural gas and LNG are core to Baker Hughes' strategy, and we will continue to play a key role in providing natural gas as a safe, reliable resource to the world. In addition to our focus on natural gas and LNG, Baker Hughes has spent considerable time over the last few years to move and accelerate our broader strategy forward. During the third quarter, we outlined how we are working to best position Baker Hughes for today and in the coming years. 
We have given a lot of thought around how to service the oil and gas and energy markets today while also investing for the future across the industrial space and various new energy initiatives. While we continue to execute our strategy through the 3 pillars of transform the core, invest for growth and position for new frontiers, the way that we're thinking about the company and our broader long-term strategy is clearly evolving. 
As we recently highlighted at an investor conference at the beginning of September, we are starting to view our company in 2 broad business areas: oilfield services and equipment and industrial energy technology. On the OFE side of the company, we have a technology-leading global enterprise with core strengths in drilling services, high-end completion tools, flexible pipe, artificial lift and production and downstream chemicals. We strongly believe that these businesses can generate top-tier returns and free cash flow conversion. OFSE is poised to benefit from cyclical growth in the coming years as we believe that we are in the early stages of a broad-based multiyear recovery that will be characterized by longer-term investments into the core OPEC+ countries. 
The way we think about industrial energy technology, or IET, is essentially our TPS and DS businesses. Both product companies have compelling portfolios that are beginning to see significant secular growth opportunities, particularly in the areas like hydrogen and CCUS. With core competencies across a number of offerings like power generation, compression and condition monitoring, as well as a growing presence in flow control, industrial asset management and digital, we have a strong foundation on which to build an even more comprehensive presence in the broad industrial energy technology markets. We believe that focusing on 2 major business areas with close alignment will enhance our flexibility, improve execution, increase shareholder returns and provide long-term optionality as the energy markets evolve. 
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, activity levels continued to increase during the third quarter with North America outpacing the international markets broadly. As I just mentioned, we believe the OFS market is in the early stages of a broad-based multiyear recovery. Internationally, we saw the strongest rig count growth during the third quarter in Southeast Asia followed by a more modest growth in the North Sea and Latin America. The return to growth in Russia and the Middle East has been slower as OPEC+ is taking a measured approach to increasing production. However, based on discussions with our customers, the pipeline of opportunities in these regions continues to grow and will likely be a major driver of international growth in 2022. 
In North America, offshore activity was disrupted by hurricanes during the month of August, while U.S. land continues to steadily move higher. The underlying trends in North America remain the same with public E&Ps and IOCs remaining disciplined in deploying capital while private E&Ps remain more active. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect firm activity during the fourth quarter and continued strong growth in 2022. 
While activity levels and pricing discussions are both moving in the right direction, our OFS business has also had to navigate multiple challenges during the third quarter. These include Hurricane Ida, COVID-related impacts, supply chain constraints and higher input costs in our production chemicals business. 
Despite these challenges, we remain focused on growing our margin rates through a combination of cost reduction and efficiency initiatives as well as pricing increases to offset higher costs. As a result, we remain committed to driving OFS EBITDA margins to 20 [indiscernible] level over the medium term. 
Moving to TPS. The outlook continues to improve driven by opportunities in LNG, onshore, offshore production, pumps and valves and new energy initiatives. We still expect the order outlook for TPS in 2021 to be roughly consistent with 2020. Importantly, the case for a multiyear growth opportunity beginning next year continues to improve. While we expect the majority of the order growth in TPS to be driven by LNG over the next couple of years, we anticipate that we will start to book more meaningful equipment orders related to hydrogen and CCUS in 2022. 
In LNG, while we did not book any awards during the third quarter, we still expect to book 1 or 2 additional awards by the end of 2021. Based on the pace of discussions with multiple customers and the positive fundamentals in the global gas market, we still see the opportunity for an additional 100 to 150 MTPA of awards over the next 2 to 3 years with the bias towards the upper end of that range. 
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, we see multiple opportunities for continued growth. Most notably, our onshore/offshore production segment is poised to benefit from a strong project pipeline for FPSO awards driven by a number of opportunities in Latin America. In the third quarter, we were pleased to book 2 large FPSO awards in Brazil for power generation and compression equipment, building on our recent success early in 2021 and in 2020. We have now booked 8 FPSO and offshore topside equipment awards so far in 2021, which follows 5 awards in 2020. 
We also continue to see success in the industrial market, where TPS recently secured wins for our NovaLT industrial gas turbine technology in India and China. We are deploying our NovaLT turbines for power generation across several industrial segments, including electronics, ammonia production and pharmaceutical manufacturing. In carbon capture, TPS was selected to supply booster and export centrifugal pumps at Northern Lights CO2 transport and storage project in Norway. This order highlights our CO2 pump injection capabilities and is the first CCUS award for our pumps product line. 
For TPS services, we saw continued signs of recovery during the quarter with strong growth across transactional and contractual services as well as our upgrade business. and we remain optimistic about the outlook for 2022. 
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we remain focused on rightsizing the business, improving profitability and optimizing the portfolio in the face of what remains an unclear long-term offshore outlook. Trends in our OFE business remained somewhat mixed despite Brent prices around $80. We continue to see a strong pipeline of flexibles order opportunities as well as improving market conditions in our international wellheads and services business. 
For industry-wide subsea trades, we continue to expect modest improvement in 2021 and followed by some additional growth in 2022. During the third quarter, we were pleased to be awarded a contract by Chevron Australia to deliver subsea compression manifold technology for the Jansz-Io Compression Project in offshore Western Australia. This important win builds on our previous success for subsea equipment orders for Chevron's Gorgon natural gas facility. 
We recently completed the merger of our Subsea Drilling Systems business with MHWirth. We own 50% of the new fully independent company now called HMH. The merger is an excellent example of how we are transforming the core to ensure that we're making the right strategic decisions for Baker Hughes. By combining the 2 businesses, HMH will have more capability and a more integrated offering. Customers are incredibly complementary about this enhanced model, and we look forward to seeing HMH succeed in the future. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, we saw multiple challenges during the quarter. Electrical component shortages, largely around semiconductors, boards and displays, led to lower revenue conversion as well as broader supply chain constraints that drove pressure in the quarter. We recognize that we have work to do in digital solutions to drive operating margins back to an acceptable level. We are implementing changes across the business to drive operational improvements and ensure that we have the right team in place to take this business back to where it needs to be. 
Core to our strategy in DS is building out our industrial asset management platform. This area of focus encompasses a range of digital services and products around asset performance, asset inspection and emissions management. As the world strives towards a net zero target in the coming decades, enterprise-level industrial asset management capabilities will be a key driver by enabling better operating efficiency, lowering energy consumption and reducing emissions across multiple industries. 
Today, we have a strong position in monitoring critical industrial assets across a range of different facilities. The next steps in our strategy will be expanding our presence to noncritical assets and developing software capabilities to allow us to cover the entire balance of plant. 
During the quarter, DS continued to expand its industrial asset management presence with a number of wins across multiple end markets. We were pleased to announce the strategic framework alliance agreement with SABIC for Integrated Asset Performance Management services. This 5-year alliance includes the delivery of Bently Nevada's plant-wide condition monitoring and machine asset protection services across over 1,200 assets at over 16 SABIC sites in Saudi Arabia. The partnership with SABIC will deliver localized maintenance support and access to Bently Nevada's growing suite of sensors, hardware, software and engineering services, including the expansive now cloud-enabled System 1 platform. In Latin America, the Bently Nevada team secured a contract with a major company to apply System 1 and condition monitoring solutions to 2 hydroelectric plants and a wind farm. System 1 will deliver proactive asset management to more than 600 megawatts of power between the free power generation facilities, enabling safer and more reliable renewable energy. 
Despite a more challenging quarter in parts of our portfolio, we believe that Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned in the coming years to deliver sector-leading free cash flow conversion while also building one of the most compelling energy transition growth stories. We are committed to evolving our company with the energy markets while maintaining our prioritization on free cash flow, returns above our cost of capital and returning capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.4 billion, up 6% sequentially, driven by TPS, OFS and OFE and partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were up 5%, driven by increases in OFE, OFS and DS partially offset by a decrease in TPS. 
Remaining performance obligation was $23.5 billion down 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.6 billion down 1% sequentially, and services RPO ended at $15.9 billion down 2% sequentially. The reduction in RPO in the quarter was primarily driven by foreign exchange movements. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.1, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1. 
Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion down 1% sequentially, driven by declines in TPS, OFE and DS partially offset by an increase in OFS. Year-over-year, revenue was up 1% driven by increases in OFS, TPS and DS partially offset by a decrease in OFE. 
Operating income for the quarter was $378 million. Adjusted operating income was $402 million, which excludes $24 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 21% sequentially and 72% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 7.9%, up 140 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 330 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $664 million, which excludes $24 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. 
Corporate costs were $105 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat compared to third quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $262 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially. 
Net interest expense was $67 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $193 million. GAAP earnings per share was $0.01. Included in GAAP earnings per share are losses from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai. These charges are recorded in other nonoperating income. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $305 million. Free cash flow for the third quarter includes $40 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are again particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the third quarter following the strength we saw in the first half of 2021. We have now generated almost $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this year, which includes $210 million of cash restructuring and separation-related payments. For the total year 2021, we now believe that our free cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA will exceed 50%. 
We are pleased to see the performance this year as we have worked hard to improve our working capital and cash processes. Our diverse portfolio of capital-light businesses and strong free cash flow performance provides the company with flexibility and optionality when it comes to our broader capital allocation strategy. 
Last year, this flexibility allowed us to be the only company in our core peer group to maintain its dividend during the COVID crisis. This year, a recovery from the industry downturn, coupled with our strong cash performance, enabled us to authorize a $2 billion share repurchase in July, which we began to execute on in early September. In the third quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $106 million at an average price of just over $24 per share. 
Going forward, our strong balance sheet and strong free cash flow capability provide us with attractive optionality to continue to return cash to shareholders and also invest in offerings related to energy transition. More specifically, in addition to paying our dividend, we intend to repurchase shares on a consistent basis and deploy capital into tuck-in M&A and technology investments on an opportunistic basis. 
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. Starting with Oilfield Services. Revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. International revenue was up 2% sequentially led by increases in Latin America and the Middle East offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the North Sea. North American revenue increased 3% with solid growth in North America land offset by declines in North America offshore due to Hurricane Ida disruptions. Operating income was $190 million, up 11% sequentially. OFS operating margin rates expanded 60 basis points to 7.9% and due to higher volume and lower depreciation and amortization. Overall, OFS results were below our expectations in the third quarter due to several factors but, most notably, Hurricane Ida and supply chain-related issues that impacted both revenues and margins. Our chemicals business was the most heavily affected from these issues with some pricing increases offset by escalating input freight and logistics costs. 
As we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect to see solid sequential improvement in international activity and continued improvement in North America. As a result, we expect sequential revenue growth for OFS in the fourth quarter in the mid-single digits. On the margin side, we expect stronger sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter as some of the supply chain-related headwinds abate and the expected product sales lead to a more favorable mix. As a result, we believe that operating margin rates could approach double digits in the fourth quarter. 
Although it's still early, I would like to give you some initial thoughts on how we see the OFS market in 2022. In the international market, we expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery with double-digit growth a likely scenario across all geographic markets. In North America, we have limited visibility next year due to the short cycle nature of the market. We believe that the region could experience strong double-digit growth if commodity prices remain at current levels. With this type of macro backdrop, we would expect to generate double-digit revenue growth in OFS in 2022. Margin rates should also see strong improvement as some of the recent supply chain and cost escalation headwinds normalize. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $724 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Strong year-over-year growth was driven by Subsea Production Systems and Subsea Services. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by a large contract from Chevron Australia for subsea compression manifold technology. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in orders in Subsea Drilling Systems and Subsea Services partially offset by lower activity in SPS. 
Revenue was $603 million down 17% year-over-year primarily driven by declines in SPS, SPC projects and the disposition of SPC flow partially offset by growth in subsea services and flexibles. Operating income was $14 million down 27% year-over-year, driven by lower volumes. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by the removal of SDS from consolidated OFE operations. We expect operating margin rate to remain in the low single digits. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect a modest recovery in offshore activity driven by higher oil prices and capital deployment into low-cost basins and projects. We expect OFE revenue to be down primarily driven by the deconsolidation of SDS, but we expect OFE margins to be in the low to mid-single-digit range driven by business mix and benefits from the recent cost-out actions taken. 
Next, I will cover Turbomachinery. Rod and the team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution, and we are very pleased with the performance the TPS team has delivered this year. Orders in the quarter were $1.7 billion down 9% year-over-year. Equipment orders were down 33% year-over-year. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by 2 large FPSO awards in Brazil for power generation and compression equipment. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a large LNG order we received in the third quarter of 2020 from Qatar Petroleum. 
Service orders in the quarter were up 31% year-over-year driven by increases in transactional services, contractual services and upgrades. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 3% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up 2%. Services revenue was up 4% versus the prior year. Operating income for TPS was $278 million, up 46% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and continued execution on cost productivity. Operating margin was 17.8% up 520 basis points year-over-year. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect strong sequential revenue growth due to the continued execution of our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog as well as typical fourth quarter seasonality. As a result, TPS operating income should increase on a sequential basis with operating margin rates likely flat due to equipment project timing. 
Looking into 2022, we expect double-digit orders growth in TPS led by LNG opportunities. We also see a solid pipeline of opportunities in our onshore/offshore production segment along with growth opportunities in pumps, valves, hydrogen and CCUS. Although we expect to see a strong increase in TPS orders in this environment, we expect revenue to be roughly flat or modestly up in 2022. This will depend on the growth of services, the pacing of equipment project execution and order intake early in the year. On the margin side, we expect operating income margin rates to be roughly flat to modestly down, depending on the mix between equipment and service. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $523 million, up 6% year-over-year. We saw growth in orders in industrial and transportation. Sequentially, orders were down 3%, driven by declines in oil and gas and power. Revenue for the quarter was $510 million, up 1% year-over-year primarily driven by higher volumes in process and pipeline services and Waygate Technologies partially offset by lower volume in Nexus Controls and Bently Nevada. Sequentially, revenue was down 2%, driven by lower volume in Bently Nevada partially offset by TPS. 
As Lorenzo noted earlier, electrical component shortages and supply chain constraints led to lower revenue conversion during the quarter. GF also saw some COVID-19 mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific and the Middle East and delays in plant outages as a result of Hurricane Ida. 
Operating income for the quarter was $26 million down 44% year-over-year largely driven by headwinds from mix of volume supply chain challenges and higher R&D costs. Sequentially, operating income was up 3%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue and margin rate growth in line with the traditional year-end seasonality. Looking into 2022, we expect solid growth in revenue as supply chain constraints begin to ease and orders pick up across Digital Solutions. With higher volumes, we expect strong improvement in DS margins. 
Overall, I am pleased with our continued strong free cash flow execution and TPS business performance. While we face short-term challenges in our DS and OFS businesses, we are confident in our ability to execute in the fourth quarter and into 2022. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

And during the course of the next few years, we see projects of 100 to 150 MTPA being awarded, and we've got a bias towards the upper end of that and feel very good about the projects coming through. A number of customer discussions that have been ongoing, and you've seen what's happening in the industry at the moment. So we feel good about LNG with some large FIDs as well as small midsized opportunities and then also in the other segments of our TPS business. 
When you look at the offshore/onshore production side, most notably with some of the FPSOs and a strong number of opportunities in Latin America coming through; continued traction on the services business, both transactional and contractual.

So previously, we've also made other announcements around the linkage with Air Products. So you're starting to see the market mature and also the opportunities for markets. We look to 2022, we expect to see $100 million to $200 million of orders from the new energy spaces. 
And as we go forward during the course of the next 3 to 4 years, we think that it could be around 10% of our TPS orders coming from the new energy spaces. And as we said before, by the end of the decade, we could have as much as $6 billion to $7 billion of orders in the new energy spaces. So good traction. And as you know, we're coming up to COP 26 and there's a lot of activity. And we think that with continued regulation and continued support and policies, there's going to be more firming up in the new energy space as we go forward."

Look, as I said, OFS revenues were up 3% sequentially in the quarter. North America land actually basically performed in line with overall market trends when you factor in the heavy influence of our oilfield and industrials chemicals business. And international, we did see some increases primarily in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East that were offset by declines in some other areas due to some of the one-off factors that we talk about. 
So if I break it down and look at what was going on and what impacted revenue, a couple of things there. First, we did mention Ida as well as some of the supply chain constraints. So I'd say these 2 items cost us about $30 million to $40 million in revenue during the quarter. Ida, obviously, pretty straightforward as to what was going on. Logistics were impacted by just timing of some shipments, some COVID-related things and a couple of our suppliers and a couple of factories that will come back, not anything lost there. And then Asia Pacific, specifically was modestly down during the quarter, really related to some COVID delays and mobility issues. And that was about $10 million to $15 million of that overall revenue impact. 
And I'd say in the second area where we saw some impacts in the quarter, again, I think they're transitory, were around margin impacts related to some of the supply chain items that I talked about. Most notably, we saw some higher freight and shipping costs across several product lines that resulted in higher cost in the quarter. We saw that particularly in lift and in the chemicals business. And while we have been pushing price increases, there is a delay in that coming through with some of the contracts and things that we have in place. And I'd say, Chase, we -- as far as the COVID-related items go in factories and stuff, we have been working with the supply chain to build up inventory and safety stock to be able to handle that as we move forward. 
And then on the logistics front, we are starting to see that stabilize and ease a bit. We saw a lot of capacity constraints, particularly in air, as commercial aviation is well below prepandemic levels and you don't have as much room in the belly of planes with fewer flights. So as the U.S. opens up  and more countries open up here, we're starting to see that creep back up, and we've got good plans to deal with that. 
And look, I'd say the team made some really smart decisions here in the quarter on some of the product sales, Chase, where we saw logistics cost increase. We work with our customers to make sure we weren't impacting their timings. And the team decided not to ship at some of these higher costs and expedited freight costs and did the right thing for customers and for shareholders in terms of delaying some of those shipments and getting the lower cost as we look here in the fourth quarter. 
So over it, on top of it, everybody is working on it, and I think most of this is transitory. We're still spending a lot of time on chemicals as they have some unique things going on in the supply chain but feel good about OFS and the margin trajectory we laid out over the short to medium term here."

Look, I'd say the chemicals business actually had about 100 bps drag on overall OFS margins in third quarter due to the input cost that we saw come through in some of the logistics challenges. And look, we have instituted multiple price increases in the chemicals business. But most of our large contracts have contractual price renegotiations every 3 to 6 months. And when we  put some of these increases in place, it does take some time for them to roll through based on the contracts that we have. But spot prices have definitely been taken up. 
Given how quickly we saw increases from inputs like ethylene and propylene, there is a bit of a delay in terms of getting that through to customers. The other thing in our Chemicals business that's a bit unique for us is we've been particularly impacted by our sizable presence in North America and our concentration of supply in the Gulf Coast. About 75% of our supply chain rolls to the Gulf Coast, which has been impacted by several things this year; earlier, the Texas freeze; and then obviously, in August, Hurricane Ida, and about 10% of our North America chemical business is in the Gulf Coast. So that saw a drop here in the quarter as well. 
So look, we've got some pretty good contracts in place. We've worked to diversify the supply base here in the short term. I'd also remind you that we started back in 2018, and I'm happy to say that in the early part of 2022, our factory in Singapore should be up and running. That is going to be a natural margin accretion, Chase, as we have secured pretty favorable input costs there and are going to be closer to a lot of our customers in Asia, which will naturally cut down on logistics costs. 
The Head of Supply Chain for Maria Claudia is spending his time down in Sugarland and working to make sure these things are smoothed out here. So for us, it really boils down to 2 things. It's getting those price increases through, which I'd feel good we'll start to fill them coming. And we've worked hard on the supply chain to make sure that the logistics are squared away, and we're working on the supply base as far as the input costs go. 
And I just note that, typically, the chemicals business is accretive to overall OFS margins. They've done a great job through the first half of the year. We did see that flip in the third quarter here and do think it's transitory. And as things start to normalize, that business will see margin rates improve. And again, Chase, we'll just reiterate that we feel good about the margin track that we laid out for OFS and being able to deliver on that 20%-plus EBITDA here in the near to medium term."

And I'd say the supply chain is primarily focused around electrical component shortages, largely around semiconductors, boards and displays that led to really some lower convertibility in the quarter. And there's real tightness in supply in that market. We did have a quality issue from one of our suppliers that came out late in the quarter. And with the tightness in the supply chain and then the supplier base, that typically could have been rectified within the quarter. That has certainly had an impact and made some of the shipments slip out. 
I'd say, overall, the component shortages -- and a little bit around logistics and similar things we saw in Asia in OFS, we also saw in DS, roughly impacted the top line, about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Look, we've been well aware of this. We've been taking steps to make sure we have got the right products to fulfill, and I'd say the teams do daily production meetings on this and move things around accordingly. We have started to see that stabilize a little bit and feel good that we've got what we need to deliver in the fourth quarter from a supply chain standpoint and are obviously working on 2022 as we speak today. 
Look, to get margins back up into the mid-teens, which is where they should be, it will require higher volume and more recovery from our biggest businesses like Bently Nevada, Nexus and Waygate. And for fourth quarter, in particular, we do see a strong sequential revenue in line with traditional year-end seasonality. As I said, the supply chain constraints around electrical components is stabilizing. And the logistics, we've worked through similar to what we've done in OFS and have that lined up for the quarter as well. So look, we should see margin rate growth in line with the traditional seasonality as well. 
And then for 2022, the team is working hard to make sure supply chain is certainly not an issue. And again, it comes down to getting those orders in, in the big businesses, which we've got a really solid pipeline. And as we see the economy recover, we should see strength in those businesses, particularly in the industrial sector."

And I'd just remind you -- again, I mentioned the chemical factory that's going to be starting in Singapore in the first half of the year. In addition to that, we have a lot of the initiatives that have been taking hold over the last 12 to 18 months, including remote operations. We still are closing down some rooftops, and we've got some supply chain moves where we're moving things closer to our largest customer base. 
So there's still some of the things, Scott, that we put into place that haven't fully matured and aren't fully reflected in the results yet, and that will come through in the fourth quarter and into next year as we bridge over to that 20%-plus EBITDA rate."

Yes, David, look, I mean, Rod and the team have done an outstanding job this year. And I'd say from a backlog conversion standpoint, and I've seen this for almost 20 years now in TPS, things can move around from a project timing perspective with it's mostly customer schedules that moved that with some moving forward and some being pushed back. 
So I'd say what we're seeing right now is just typical movement across the backlog. Our actually capability and capacity to fulfill has certainly gotten better over the last few years. And so we can have that flexibility for our customers. And so I'd say what you've seen this year is you've seen some projects move in. You've seen some projects move out. And just given the order cadence and how that cycle is -- has played out, that's really what's driven the uptick in what we see in equipment revenue for 2022. 
As far as services go, look, we saw a bit of a dip last year. Contractual services has performed exactly in line with how we thought. We did see some movement in transactional services. And then we started to see an uptick in upgrades coming through this year. And the tailwinds for services look pretty good for next year as well. So while you may not see the same level of growth that you do in equipment because of the way the backlog is going to convert, we're pretty happy with the trajectory that we see in TPS services. 
So I'd just break that down again. Contractual services have performed right in line with what we expected. Transactional orders are up this year, and we expect revenue to be up next year for that. And the upgrade cadence looks pretty good as well. So listen, overall next year margins for both businesses are -- within TPS are going to be strong. The overall margin rate is really going to depend on the mix of equipment versus services. 
And the other thing I'd just add about the performance here is the cost productivity has been outstanding this year with how Rod and the team have been executing. I would expect that they would drive productivity next year. Given everything we're seeing in the commodity markets, not prudent right now to count on it falling through at the same level given some of the potential inflation that's coming through. But I think we've demonstrated this year that, that team can drive productivity, and it's shown up in the margin rates, and they're ahead of where we thought they'd be at this time, and really pleased with that and feel good about the outlook for next year."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with the way the team has continued to execute on our strategy over the course of the third quarter.

We are pleased with the way the team has continued to execute on our strategy over the course of the third quarter. At the total company level, we had a strong orders quarter, grew adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income margin rate sequentially and year-over-year and had another solid quarter of free cash flow. 
While we did experience some mixed results across our product companies, on the positive side, TPS generated strong orders, operating income and margin rates, and OFE had a solid orders quarter. On the more challenging side, our OFS business was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida, cost inflation in our chemicals business and delivery issues stemming from supply chain constraints, while DS also faced supply chain delays that impacted product deliveries. 
As we look at the macro environment, the global economy continues to recover. However, the pace of growth is being hampered by lingering effects from the COVID-19 Delta variant, global chip shortages, supply chain issues and energy supply constraints in multiple parts of the world. Despite these headwinds, global growth appears to be on a relatively solid footing, underpinning a favorable outlook for the oil market, aided by continued spending discipline by the world's largest producers. 
In the natural gas and LNG markets, fundamentals remain strong with a combination of solid demand growth and extremely tight supply in many parts of the world. In fact, we believe the positive case for structural demand growth in natural gas as part of the broader energy transition is becoming increasingly evident.
The current environment illustrates the need for policymakers to focus on the utilization of natural gas as a baseload fuel that can be combined with renewable energy sources to provide a cleaner, safer, more affordable and more reliable source of energy to populations around the world. 
A number of developed economies have had great success over the last 10 to 15 years, lowering their carbon emissions by switching from coal to natural gas. However, some policy scenarios have seen a more rapid conversion straight to renewables, which limits the role of natural gas as a transition fuel and can lead to broader grid instability. We believe that there is a strong and logical combination of a secure, stable baseload of natural gas that is needed to complement renewable energy sources and, in turn, offset intermittencies. 
As we can see from recent events, the costs of moving too aggressively are beginning to surface as multiple parts of the world are experiencing energy shortages, unprecedented increases in energy prices and shutdowns and brownouts across multiple industries. The increase in natural gas prices has been most acute due to a number of factors, including underinvestment in gas reserves, a decline in contribution from hydroelectric and renewable power and continued increases in energy demand. Ironically, the fallout from higher prices has also led to an increase in coal consumption, leading to coal shortages and a spike in coal prices. 
Natural gas has been a key contributor to lowering emissions in the United States over the last 15 years as power generation consumption switched from coal to natural gas. U.S. power consumption of natural gas has increased from around 16% of total generation to roughly 40% over the past 20 years, while coal consumption has declined from over 50% of the energy supply mix to approximately 25% over the same period. By comparison, today, roughly 60% of Asia Pacific's power generation comes from coal and about 10% from natural gas. 
As more countries step up their carbon reduction commitments, we believe that natural gas will play a critical role in displacing higher emission sources like coal and by supporting the growth in renewable energy technologies with relatively cheaper and affordable baseload power. Natural gas and LNG are core to Baker Hughes' strategy, and we will continue to play a key role in providing natural gas as a safe, reliable resource to the world. 
In addition to our focus on natural gas and LNG, Baker Hughes has spent considerable time over the last few years to move and accelerate our broader strategy forward. During the third quarter, we outlined how we are working to best position Baker Hughes for today and in the coming years. 
We have given a lot of thought around how to service the oil and gas and energy markets today while also investing for the future across the industrial space and various new energy initiatives. While we continue to execute our strategy through the 3 pillars of transform the core, invest for growth and position for new frontiers, the way that we're thinking about the company and our broader long-term strategy is clearly evolving. 
As we recently highlighted at an investor conference at the beginning of September, we are starting to view our company in 2 broad business areas: oilfield services and equipment and industrial energy technology. On the OFSE side of the company, we have a technology-leading global enterprise with core strengths in drilling services, high-end completion tools, flexible pipe, artificial lift and production and downstream chemicals. We strongly believe that these businesses can generate top-tier returns and free cash flow conversion. OFSE is poised to benefit from cyclical growth in the coming years as we believe that we are in the early stages of a broad-based multiyear recovery that will be characterized by longer-term investments into the core OPEC+ countries. 
The way we think about industrial energy technology, or IET, is essentially our TPS and DS businesses. Both product companies have compelling portfolios that are beginning to see significant secular growth opportunities, particularly in the areas like hydrogen and CCUS. With core competencies across a number of offerings like power generation, compression and condition monitoring as well as a growing presence in flow control, industrial asset management and digital, we have a strong foundation on which to build an even more comprehensive presence in the broad industrial energy technology markets. We believe that focusing on 2 major business areas with close alignment will enhance our flexibility, improve execution, increase shareholder returns and provide long-term optionality as the energy markets evolve. 
Now I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In oilfield services, activity levels continued to increase during the third quarter with North America outpacing the international markets broadly. As I just mentioned, we believe the OFS market is in the early stages of a broad-based multiyear recovery. 
Internationally, we saw the strongest rig count growth during the third quarter in Southeast Asia followed by a more modest growth in the North Sea and Latin America. The return to growth in Russia and the Middle East has been slower as OPEC+ is taking a measured approach to increasing production. However, based on discussions with our customers, the pipeline of opportunities in these regions continues to grow and will likely be a major driver of international growth in 2022. 
In North America, offshore activity was disrupted by hurricanes during the month of August, while U.S. land continues to steadily move higher. The underlying trends in North America remain the same with public E&Ps and IOCs remaining disciplined in deploying capital while private E&Ps remain more active. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect firm activity during the fourth quarter and continued strong growth in 2022.
While activity levels and pricing discussions are both moving in the right direction, our OFS business has also had to navigate multiple challenges during the third quarter. These include Hurricane Ida, COVID-related impacts, supply chain constraints and higher input costs in our production chemicals business. 
Despite these challenges, we remain focused on growing our margin rates through a combination of cost reduction and efficiency initiatives as well as pricing increases to offset higher costs. As a result, we remain committed to driving OFS EBITDA margins to 20% level over the medium term. 
Moving to TPS. The outlook continues to improve driven by opportunities in LNG, onshore/offshore production, pumps and valves and new energy initiatives. We still expect the order outlook for TPS in 2021 to be roughly consistent with 2020. Importantly, the case for a multiyear growth opportunity beginning next year continues to improve. While we expect the majority of the order growth in TPS to be driven by LNG over the next couple of years, we anticipate that we will start to book more meaningful equipment orders related to hydrogen and CCUS in 2022. 
In LNG, while we did not book any awards during the third quarter, we still expect to book 1 or 2 additional awards by the end of 2021. Based on the pace of discussions with multiple customers and the positive fundamentals in the global gas market, we still see the opportunity for an additional 100 to 150 MTPA of awards over the next 2 to 3 years with a bias towards the upper end of that range.
For the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, we see multiple opportunities for continued growth. Most notably, our onshore/offshore production segment is poised to benefit from a strong project pipeline for FPSO awards driven by a number of opportunities in Latin America. In the third quarter, we were pleased to book 2 large FPSO awards in Brazil for power generation and compression equipment, building on our recent success early in 2021 and in 2020. We have now booked 8 FPSO and offshore topside equipment awards so far in 2021, which follows 5 awards in 2020. 
We also continue to see success in the industrial market, where TPS recently secured wins for our NovaLT industrial gas turbine technology in India and China. We are deploying our NovaLT turbines for power generation across several industrial segments, including electronics, ammonia production and pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
In carbon capture, TPS was selected to supply booster and export centrifugal pumps to the Northern Lights CO2 transport and storage project in Norway. This order highlights our CO2 pump injection capabilities and is the first CCUS award for our pumps product line.
For TPS services, we saw continued signs of recovery during the quarter with strong growth across transactional and contractual services as well as our upgrade business, and we remain optimistic about the outlook for 2022. 
Next, on Oilfield Equipment, we remain focused on rightsizing the business, improving profitability and optimizing the portfolio in the face of what remains an unclear long-term offshore outlook. Trends in our OFE business remain somewhat mixed despite Brent prices around $80. We continue to see a strong pipeline of flexibles order opportunities as well as improving market conditions in our international wellheads and services business. 
For industry-wide subsea trees, we continue to expect modest improvement in 2021 and followed by some additional growth in 2022. During the third quarter, we were pleased to be awarded a contract by Chevron Australia to deliver subsea compression manifold technology for the Jansz-Io compression project in offshore Western Australia. This important win builds on our previous success for subsea equipment orders for Chevron's Gorgon natural gas facility. 
We recently completed the merger of our Subsea Drilling Systems business with MHWirth. We own 50% of the new fully independent company now called HMH. The merger is an excellent example of how we are transforming the core to ensure that we're making the right strategic decisions for Baker Hughes. By combining the 2 businesses, HMH will have more capability and a more integrated offering. Customers are incredibly complementary about this enhanced model. And we look forward to seeing HMH succeed in the future. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions, we saw multiple challenges during the quarter. Electrical component shortages, largely around semiconductors, boards and displays, led to lower revenue conversion as well as broader supply chain constraints that drove pressure in the quarter. We recognize that we have work to do in Digital Solutions to drive operating margins back to an acceptable level. We are implementing changes across the business to drive operational improvements and ensure that we have the right team in place to take this business back to where it needs to be.
Core to our strategy in DS is building out our industrial asset management platform. This area of focus encompasses a range of digital services and products around asset performance, asset inspection and emissions management. As the world strives towards a net zero target in the coming decades, enterprise-level industrial asset management capabilities will be a key driver by enabling better operating efficiency, lowering energy consumption and reducing emissions across multiple industries.
Today, we have a strong position in monitoring critical industrial assets across a range of different facilities. The next steps in our strategy will be expanding our presence to noncritical assets and developing software capabilities to allow us to cover the entire balance of plant. 
During the quarter, DS continued to expand its industrial asset management presence with a number of wins across multiple end markets. We were pleased to announce the strategic framework alliance agreement with SABIC for integrated asset performance management services. This 5-year alliance includes the delivery of Bently Nevada's plant-wide condition monitoring and machine asset protection services across over 1,200 assets at over 16 SABIC sites in Saudi Arabia. 
The partnership with SABIC will deliver localized maintenance support and access to Bently Nevada's growing suite of sensors, hardware, software and engineering services, including the expansive, now cloud-enabled System 1 platform. In Latin America, the Bently Nevada team secured a contract with a major company to apply System 1 and condition monitoring solutions to 2 hydroelectric plants and a wind farm. System 1 will deliver proactive asset management to more than 600 megawatts of power between the 3 power generation facilities, enabling safer and more reliable renewable energy. 
Despite a more challenging quarter in parts of our portfolio, we believe that Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned in the coming years to deliver sector-leading free cash flow conversion while also building one of the most compelling energy transition growth stories. We are committed to evolving our company with the energy markets while maintaining our prioritization on free cash flow, returns above our cost of capital and returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.4 billion, up 6% sequentially driven by TPS, OFS and OFE, partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year",1844,"Thanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.4 billion, up 6% sequentially driven by TPS, OFS and OFE, partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions. Year-over-year, orders were up 5% driven by increases in OFE, OFS and DS, partially offset by a decrease in TPS. 
Remaining performance obligation was $23.5 billion, down 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $7.6 billion, down 1% sequentially, and services RPO ended at $15.9 billion, down 2% sequentially. The reduction in RPO in the quarter was primarily driven by foreign exchange movements. 
Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.1, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.1. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, down 1% sequentially driven by declines in TPS, OFE and DS, partially offset by an increase in OFS. Year-over-year, revenue was up 1% driven by increases in OFS, TPS and DS, partially offset by a decrease in OFE. 
Operating income for the quarter was $378 million. Adjusted operating income was $402 million, which excludes $24 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 21% sequentially and 72% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 7.9%, up 140 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 330 basis points. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $664 million, which excludes $24 million of restructuring, separation and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. 
Corporate costs were $105 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat compared to third quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $262 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly flat sequentially. 
Net interest expense was $67 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $193 million. GAAP earnings per share was $0.01. Included in GAAP earnings per share are losses from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai. These charges are recorded in other nonoperating income. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16. 
Turning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $305 million. Free cash flow for the third quarter includes $40 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. We are, again, particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in the third quarter following the strength we saw in the first half of 2021. We have now generated almost $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this year, which includes $210 million of cash restructuring and separation-related payments. For the total year 2021, we now believe that our free cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA will exceed 50%.
We are pleased to see the performance this year as we have worked hard to improve our working capital and cash processes. Our diverse portfolio of capital-light businesses and strong free cash flow performance provides the company with flexibility and optionality when it comes to our broader capital allocation strategy. 
Last year, this flexibility allowed us to be the only company in our core peer group to maintain its dividend during the COVID crisis. This year, a recovery from the industry downturn, coupled with our strong cash performance, enabled us to authorize a $2 billion share repurchase in July, which we began to execute on in early September. In the third quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $106 million at an average price of just over $24 per share. 
Going forward, our strong balance sheet and strong free cash flow capability provide us with attractive optionality to continue to return cash to shareholders and also invest in offerings related to energy transition. More specifically, in addition to paying our dividend, we intend to repurchase shares on a consistent basis and deploy capital into tuck-in M&A and technology investments on an opportunistic basis.
Now I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. Starting with oilfield services. Revenue in the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. International revenue was up 2% sequentially led by increases in Latin America and the Middle East, offset by declines in Asia Pacific and the North Sea. North American revenue increased 3% with solid growth in North America land, offset by declines in North America offshore due to Hurricane Ida disruptions. 
Operating income was $190 million, up 11% sequentially. OFS operating margin rates expanded 60 basis points to 7.9% and due to higher volume and lower depreciation and amortization. 
Overall, OFS results were below our expectations in the third quarter due to several factors but, most notably, Hurricane Ida and supply chain-related issues that impacted both revenues and margins. Our chemicals business was the most heavily affected from these issues with some pricing increases offset by escalating input, freight and logistics costs. 
As we look ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect to see solid sequential improvement in international activity and continued improvement in North America. As a result, we expect sequential revenue growth for OFS in the fourth quarter in the mid-single digits. 
On the margin side, we expect stronger sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter as some of the supply chain-related headwinds abate and the expected product sales lead to a more favorable mix. As a result, we believe that operating margin rates could approach double digits in the fourth quarter. 
Although it's still early, I would like to give you some initial thoughts on how we see the OFS market in 2022. In the international market, we expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery with double-digit growth a likely scenario across all geographic markets. In North America, we have limited visibility next year due to the short cycle nature of the market. We believe that the region could experience strong double-digit growth if commodity prices remain at current levels. With this type of macro backdrop, we would expect to generate double-digit revenue growth in OFS in 2022. Margin rates should also see strong improvement as some of the recent supply chain and cost escalation headwinds normalize. 
Moving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $724 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Strong year-over-year growth was driven by subsea production systems and subsea services. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by a large contract from Chevron Australia for subsea compression manifold technology. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in orders in subsea drilling systems and subsea services partially offset by lower activity in SPS. 
Revenue was $603 million, down 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by declines in SPS, SPC projects and the disposition of SPC flow, partially offset by growth in subsea services and flexibles. Operating income was $14 million, down 27% year-over-year, driven by lower volumes. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to decrease sequentially driven by the removal of SDS from consolidated OFE operations. We expect operating margin rate to remain in the low single digits. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect a modest recovery in offshore activity driven by higher oil prices and capital deployment into low-cost basins and projects. We expect OFE revenue to be down primarily driven by the deconsolidation of SDS. But we expect OFE margins to be in the low to mid-single-digit range driven by business mix and benefits from the recent cost-out actions taken. 
Next, I will cover turbomachinery. Rod and the team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution, and we are very pleased with the performance the TPS team has delivered this year. Orders in the quarter were $1.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year. Equipment orders were down 33% year-over-year. As Lorenzo mentioned, orders this quarter were supported by 2 large FPSO awards in Brazil for power generation and compression equipment. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a large LNG order we received in the third quarter of 2020 from Qatar Petroleum. 
Service orders in the quarter were up 31% year-over-year driven by increases in transactional services, contractual services and upgrades. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, up 3% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was up 2%. Services revenue was up 4% versus the prior year. 
Operating income for TPS was $278 million, up 46% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and continued execution on cost productivity. Operating margin was 17.8%, up 520 basis points year-over-year.
For the fourth quarter, we expect strong sequential revenue growth due to the continued execution of our LNG and onshore/offshore production backlog as well as typical fourth quarter seasonality. As a result, TPS operating income should increase on a sequential basis with operating margin rates likely flat due to equipment project timing.
Looking into 2022, we expect double-digit orders growth in TPS led by LNG opportunities. We also see a solid pipeline of opportunities in our onshore/offshore production segment along with growth opportunities in pumps, valves, hydrogen and CCUS. Although we expect to see a strong increase in TPS orders in this environment, we expect revenue to be roughly flat or modestly up in 2022. This will depend on the growth of services, the pacing of equipment project execution and order intake early in the year. On the margin side, we expect operating income margin rates to be roughly flat to modestly down, depending on the mix between equipment and service. 
Finally, in Digital Solutions. Orders for the quarter were $523 million, up 6% year-over-year. We saw growth in orders in industrial and transportation. Sequentially, orders were down 3%, driven by declines in oil and gas and power. Revenue for the quarter was $510 million, up 1% year-over-year primarily driven by higher volumes in process and pipeline services and Waygate Technologies, partially offset by lower volume in Nexus Controls and Bently Nevada. Sequentially, revenue was down 2%, driven by lower volume in Bently Nevada, partially offset by TPS. 
As Lorenzo noted earlier, electrical component shortages and supply chain constraints led to lower revenue conversion during the quarter. DS also saw some COVID-19 mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific and the Middle East and delays in plant outages as a result of Hurricane Ida. 
Operating income for the quarter was $26 million down 44% year-over-year largely driven by headwinds from mix of volume supply chain challenges and higher R&D costs. Sequentially, operating income was up 3%. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue and margin rate growth in line with the traditional year-end seasonality. 
Looking into 2022, we expect solid growth in revenue as supply chain constraints begin to ease and orders pick up across Digital Solutions. With higher volumes, we expect strong improvement in DS margins. 
Overall, I am pleased with our continued strong free cash flow execution and TPS business performance. While we face short-term challenges in our DS and OFS businesses, we are confident in our ability to execute in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud."

And during the course of the next few years, we see projects of 100 to 150 MTPA being awarded, and we've got a bias towards the upper end of that and feel very good about the projects coming through. 
A number of customer discussions that have been ongoing, and you've seen what's happening in the industry at the moment. So we feel good about LNG with some large FIDs as well as small-midsize opportunities and then also in the other segments of our TPS business. 
When you look at the offshore/onshore production side most notably with some of the FPSOs and a strong number of opportunities in Latin America coming through; continued traction on the services business, both transactional and contractual. And then as we go through '22 and beyond, also continued pipeline of good growth opportunities for our pumps, valves as well as the new energy markets of hydrogen and CCUS.

So previously, we've also made other announcements around the linkage with Air Products. So you're starting to see the market mature and also the opportunities firm up. As we look to 2022, we expect to see $100 million to $200 million of orders from the new energy spaces. 
And as we go forward during the course of the next 3 to 4 years, we think that it could be around 10% of our TPS orders coming from the new energy spaces. And as we said before, by the end of the decade, we could have as much as $6 billion to $7 billion of orders in the new energy spaces. So good traction. And as you know, we're coming up to COP26 and there's a lot of activity. And we think that with continued regulation and continued support and policies, there's going to be more firming up in the new energy space as we go forward."

Look, as I said, OFS revenues were up 3% sequentially in the quarter. North America land actually basically performed in line with overall market trends when you factor in the heavy influence of our oilfield and industrial chemicals business. And international, we did see some increases primarily in Latin America, Russia and the Middle East that were offset by declines in some other areas due to some of the one-off factors that we talk about. 
So if I break it down and look at what was going on and what impacted revenue, a couple of things there. First, we did mention Ida as well as some of the supply chain constraints. So I'd say these 2 items cost us about $30 million to $40 million in revenue during the quarter. Ida, obviously pretty straightforward as to what was going on. Logistics were impacted by just timing of some shipments, some COVID-related things and a couple of our suppliers and a couple of factories that will come back, not anything lost there. And then Asia Pacific specifically was modestly down during the quarter, really related to some COVID delays and mobility issues. And that was about $10 million to $15 million of that overall revenue impact. 
And I'd say in the second area where we saw some impacts in the quarter, again, I think they're transitory, were around margin impacts related to some of the supply chain items that I talked about. Most notably, we saw some higher freight and shipping costs across several product lines that resulted in higher cost in the quarter. We saw that particularly in lift and in the chemicals business. And while we have been pushing price increases, there is a delay in that coming through with some of the contracts and things that we have in place. 
And I'd say, Chase, we -- as far as the COVID-related items go in factories and stuff, we have been working with the supply chain to build up inventory and safety stock to be able to handle that as we move forward. And then on the logistics front, we are starting to see that stabilize and ease a bit. We saw a lot of capacity constraints, particularly in air, as commercial aviation is well below prepandemic levels and you don't have as much room in the belly of planes with fewer flights. So as the U.S. opens up and more countries open up here, we're starting to see that creep back up, and we've got good plans to deal with that. 
And look, I'd say the team made some really smart decisions here in the quarter on some of the product sales, Chase, where we saw logistics cost increase. We work with our customers to make sure we weren't impacting their timings. And the team decided not to ship at some of these higher costs and expedited freight costs and did the right thing for customers and for shareholders in terms of delaying some of those shipments and getting the lower cost as we look here in the fourth quarter. 
So over it, on top of it, everybody is working on it, and I think most of this is transitory. We're still spending a lot of time on chemicals as they have some unique things going on in the supply chain but feel good about OFS and the margin trajectory we laid out over the short to medium term here."

Look, I'd say the chemicals business actually had about 100 bps drag on overall OFS margins in third quarter due to the input cost that we saw come through in some of the logistics challenges. And look, we have instituted multiple price increases in the chemicals business. But most of our large contracts have contractual price renegotiations every 3 to 6 months. And when we put some of these increases in place, it does take some time for them to roll through based on the contracts that we have. But spot prices have definitely been taken up. Given how quickly we saw increases from inputs like ethylene and propylene, there is a bit of a delay in terms of getting that through to customers. 
The other thing in our chemicals business that's a bit unique for us is we've been particularly impacted by our sizable presence in North America and our concentration of supply in the Gulf Coast. About 75% of our supply chain rolls to the Gulf Coast, which has been impacted by several things this year: earlier, the Texas freeze; and then obviously, in August, Hurricane Ida. And about 10% of our North America chemical business is in the Gulf Coast. So that saw a drop here in the quarter as well. 
So look, we've got some pretty good contracts in place. We've worked to diversify the supply base here in the short term. I'd also remind you that we started back in 2018. And I'm happy to say that in the early part of 2022, our factory in Singapore should be up and running. That is going to be a natural margin accretion, Chase, as we have secured pretty favorable input costs there and are going to be closer to a lot of our customers in Asia, which will naturally cut down on logistics costs. The Head of Supply Chain for -- Maria Claudia is spending his (sic) [ her ] time down in Sugar Land and working to make sure these things are smoothed out here. 
So for us, it really boils down to 2 things. It's getting those price increases through, which I feel good -- we'll start to fill them coming. And we've worked hard on the supply chain to make sure that the logistics are squared away. And we're working on the supply base as far as the input costs go. 
And I just note that, typically, the chemicals business is accretive to overall OFS margins. They've done a great job through the first half of the year. We did see that flip in the third quarter here and do think it's transitory. And as things start to normalize, that business will see margin rates improve. And again, Chase, we'll just reiterate that we feel good about the margin track that we laid out for OFS and being able to deliver on that 20%-plus EBITDA here in the near to medium term."

Look, as we did say, we did see a few challenges in the quarter. And I'd say the supply chain is primarily focused around electrical component shortages, largely around semiconductors, boards and displays that led to really some lower convertibility in the quarter. 
And there's real tightness in supply in that market. We did have a quality issue from one of our suppliers that came out late in the quarter. And with the tightness in the supply chain and in the supplier base, that typically could have been rectified within the quarter. That has certainly had an impact and made some of the shipments slip out. 
I'd say, overall, the component shortages -- and a little bit around logistics and similar things we saw in Asia in OFS, we also saw in DS, roughly impacted the top line, about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Look, we've been well aware of this. We've been taking preemptive steps to make sure we have got the right products to fulfill. And I'd say the teams do daily production meetings on this and move things around accordingly. We have started to see that stabilize a little bit and feel good that we've got what we need to deliver in the fourth quarter from a supply chain standpoint and are obviously working on 2022 as we speak today. 
Look, to get margins back up into the mid-teens, which is where they should be, it will require higher volume and more recovery from our biggest businesses like Bently Nevada, Nexus and Waygate. And for fourth quarter, in particular, we do see a strong sequential revenue in line with traditional year-end seasonality. As I said, the supply chain constraints around electrical components is stabilizing. And the logistics, we've worked through similar to what we've done in OFS and have that lined up for the quarter as well. So look, we should see margin rate growth in line with the traditional seasonality as well. 
And then for 2022, the team is working hard to make sure supply chain is certainly not an issue. And again, it comes down to getting those orders in, in the big businesses, which we've got a really solid pipeline. And as we see the economy recover, we should see strength in those businesses, particularly in the industrial sector."

Look, I mean, Rod and the team have done an outstanding job this year. And I'd say from a backlog conversion standpoint, and I've seen this for almost 20 years now in TPS, things can move around from a project timing perspective with -- it's mostly customer schedules that move that with some moving forward and some being pushed back. 
So I'd say what we're seeing right now is just typical movement across the backlog. Our actually capability and capacity to fulfill has certainly gotten better over the last few years. And so we can have that flexibility for our customers. And so I'd say what you've seen this year is you've seen some projects move in. You've seen some projects move out. And just given the order cadence and how that cycle is -- has played out, that's really what's driven the uptick in what we see in equipment revenue for 2022.
As far as services go, look, we saw a bit of a dip last year. Contractual services has performed exactly in line with how we thought. We did see some movement in transactional services. And then we started to see an uptick in upgrades coming through this year. And the tailwinds for services look pretty good for next year as well. So while you may not see the same level of growth that you do in equipment because of the way the backlog is going to convert, we're pretty happy with the trajectory that we see in TPS services. 
So I'd just break that down again. Contractual services have performed right in line with what we expected. Transactional orders are up this year, and we expect revenue to be up next year for that. And the upgrade cadence looks pretty good as well. 
So listen, overall, next year margins for both businesses are -- within TPS are going to be strong. The overall margin rate is really going to depend on the mix of equipment versus services. 
And the other thing I'd just add about the performance here is the cost productivity has been outstanding this year with how Rod and the team have been executing. I would expect that they would drive productivity next year. Given everything we're seeing in the commodity markets, not prudent right now to count on it falling through at the same level given some of the potential inflation that's coming through. But I think we've demonstrated this year that, that team can drive productivity, and it's shown up in the margin rates. And they're ahead of where we thought they'd be at this time, and really pleased with that and feel good about the outlook for next year."

I mean we've got tons of examples of partnerships across the industry today. So again, we're going to be really focused on margins and cash and returns in the upstream business and IT, its growth, taking advantage of what's going on in the new energy space. And again, we'll look at overall shareholder return as we think about structure over the long term. But where these businesses naturally work together, I don't think that's a hindrance to any structure going forward. And in fact, I think it could help in multiple structures."

And listen, our goal here is to continue to be in the market. And from a capital allocation standpoint, we like the dividend. We like the pace of buyback. We've generated quite a bit of free cash flow and have excess cash to deploy in that space. And we still have capital to deploy in the tuck-in M&A and technologies that we talked about here. 
So from a buyback standpoint, we'll continue to be in the market. And look, we'll also be opportunistic if things change, and we have an opportunity to do more. So that's the thing I like about our free cash flow capabilities. It gives us some optionality here to continue to drive returns, and we'll do that."

So I just wanted to thank everyone for joining the earnings call today and just leave you with a couple of thoughts. 
We're really pleased with the way the team has executed and continues to execute on our strategy over the course of the third quarter. While we had some mixed results across OFS and DS, we're pleased with the strong operating and orders performance at TPS and a solid quarter of free cash flow. 
Looking ahead, we see a multiyear cycle in the OFS business and a multiyear growth cycle for TPS led by LNG and new energy initiatives. So we're going to continue to execute our strategy through the 3 pillars of transform the core, invest for growth and position for new frontiers. And as I mentioned, the way we're thinking about the company and our broader long-term strategy is evolving. We are starting to view our company in the 2 broad business areas of oilfield services and equipment and industrial energy technology. 
We feel Baker Hughes is uniquely positioned in the coming years to evolve with the energy markets and grow in the industrial space while maintaining our prioritization on free cash flow, returns above our cost of capital and returning capital to shareholders. 
So thanks for taking the time and look forward to speaking to you again. And operator, you may close the call."
