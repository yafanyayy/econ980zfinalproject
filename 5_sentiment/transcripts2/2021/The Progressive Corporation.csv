As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons. From the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused by social unrest. As I reflect on the year we just closed, I couldn't be more proud of the way Progressive rose to these challenges by delivering fantastic results while supporting its customers, employees, communities and partners during these unprecedented times. 
The annual report theme of resilience truly defines how we approached every obstacle during this past year. As of prior quarters, the fourth quarter profitability continued to benefit from reduction in frequency, which was partially offset by an increase in severity. Miles driven continued to be lower than the fourth quarter last year. We continue to react to the changes in driving behavior caused by the pandemic. In addition to the over $1 billion given to customers in the form of credits early on in the pandemic, we also filed personal auto rate changes that averaged a decrease of approximately 3% between April and December in over 40 states that represent approximately 85% of our country-wide premium, thereby providing our customers an aggregate annualized savings estimated at about $800 million. There's much uncertainty about reopenings, vaccine distribution and if and when will return to pre-pandemic driving patterns. Our product teams are staying abreast of the situation and continue to adjust rates to related risks, which include risks such as weather. 
We continue to recognize both policy and premium growth in the fourth quarter, which combined with the rest of the year resulted in 2020 having an increase of 2.4 million policies in force and $3 billion more net premiums written over the prior year. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit GP growth. While all of our segments contributed to this growth, our agency auto business was more heavily impacted by the federal state and local social distancing and shelter-in-place restrictions that were put in place to stop so will slow the spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a decrease in new applications year-over-year. Our Commercial Lines business saw significant growth in the for-hire transportation business as the demand for shipping services grew as a result of the pandemic. On the other hand, our Uber and lift premiums took a hit during the year as miles driven decreased with restrictions in place, and our premiums are based on actual and estimated miles over the policy term. Our property business had a profitable fourth quarter, but with the 2020 Atlanta hurricane season being the most active on record, it recognized an underwriting loss for the full year. Growth continues to be strong with our bundled Robinson business growing faster than any other segment. We're confident that we have the pricing and product enhancements in place to get closer to our target margins, and will continue to make changes as we grow. 
Despite the challenges faced in light of the pandemic, our combination of strong growth and profitability in 2020 suggests we are managing the situation well. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our personal auto product. Our first day was elevated to our newest product model in January. As part of our relief program, we also launched a temporary change to snapshot that allows existing non-snapshot customers to receive a snapshot adjusted rate after just 30 days of monitoring as opposed to the normal 6 months. This, in addition to a snapshot road test, which we had available for several months, gives consumers the ability to see their snapshot rate before purchasing a policy. While not available countrywide, where it is available, we believe this is a perfect opportunity for some customers to lower their rates based on either the driving behavior or frequency of their driving habits that's changed as a result of the pandemic. We're also investing in our Commercial Lines business. Our BOP product is now active in 18 states. Illinois went live last week. And during the fourth quarter, was added to our business ""Explorer"" platform in the direct channel. Also Smart Hall, our UBI program for truckers continues to see excellent adoption rates and is a great asset in the for-hire trucking markets. And Snapshot Proview, which expands our UBI offerings beyond truck is now available in 45 states. 
Looking to 2021, I'm happy to report that we are well positioned for further growth as reflected in our January results. We continue to make investments in pricing segmentation, cost efficiency, accurate claims handling and expense management. Most importantly, we've supported our people and retained our culture, which we know will pay huge dividends going forward. Another exciting thing about 2021 is that in April, we will celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming a public company. A fun fact, if you bought 100 shares at our IPO in 1971, it would have cost you $1,800. And at the end of 2020, that initial investment would have grown to be worth over $19 million, a 20.5% compounded annual return. Not about investment, especially if you compare it to the 9.9 return by the S&P 500 over that same period. I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our shareholders, both past and present, for investing in us over the years. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to express how pleased insight I am about the agreement with Protective Insurance Corporation. We've been very impressed with Protective's products, employees and culture. As we've said in the past, Commercial Lines is our greatest opportunity to grow, and we're excited to expand our capabilities with the expertise, protective offers and larger fleet and affinity programs and by providing additional breadth of product lines. As you know, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we're not able to share additional information at this time. We will provide additional information, thoughts after the transaction closes. Chris, I think we can open it up for questions now."

And actually, what I just talked about when I did my opening remarks was something that came out of a discussion that John Sauerland and Pat Callahan and John Murphy and I have when we were talking about the desire to have people -- have the rate to risk be really relevant to people that are driving less. And so we really, in record time, created the April Relief Snapshot program. And because time is of the essence, and maybe people are going back to work, maybe they're partially work, partially not. We wanted to be able to provide our UBI program with a shortened monitoring period. So that 30-day period is really important. So we've sent out to our current customers millions of emails. And for those where we don't have the e-mail, we're sending out actual USPS mail to alert our customers of this offering and make sure that if they are driving less and they do want receive a discount or their frequency and severity of driving those down, they can offer this option. We think that's a fantastic addition to the credits that we gave early on, the rate reductions and our road test option for consumers."

So I think that -- I'm assuming our competitors are doing similar things. For us, it really is about that balance of growth and profitability. And so we're pretty proud of the fact that in 2020, even with the reduced rate and shopping down substantially during the first part of the pandemic that we were able to grow both in prospects and sales on a full year. So that's really our concentration. We obviously look across our competitor set to see if prices are down, John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this last February, we look at a few big competitors raise their -- prices are still down, premium is down about 1.7%. And so yes, I think it will continue to be a challenge to grow but we're up for that challenge, as you can see by our January results."

We continue to have deeper segmentation. February is not going to be a great -- February is that going to be a great month for the industry because of the winter storm. And we try to obviously put a load in for those events. And last year was another unprecedented year of hurricanes. So I'm happy with the product. I'm happy with our continued ability segment. I'm happy with the fact that we're growing Robinsons across the board in both direct and the agency channel. We've increased our Platinum agents. And I think you're referring to the Homequote Explorer, very happy there. So we saw Progressive home, along with many other unaffiliated partners, and that's been a higher growth than even the agency channel. We're very excited about that. It's our highest growing segment. And when you think about having customers for life. That was really our basis for acquiring ARX is to make sure that we have those auto home bundled, one to allow us extend our auto policy life expectancy. So our retention, of course, is the holy grail, but also have those customers for life. So as their needs change, we had them, we didn't want to be the training wheels when people want at home. So those customers we see add on toys and life and other products that we're able to offer, either on our paper or not. And I will tell you, although we don't talk about this externally, the policy life expectancy on a Robinson versus some of the other segments are extraordinarily higher.

When I think of growth, it's -- we look at, obviously, PIF growth as our preferred measure because trends are going to change up and down depending on things. Obviously, the pandemic was dramatic. And we can't -- we have to react to our trends. And like I said at the beginning, even though no one took rates up last year, we continued to be able to grow new sales and prospects. How we think about it, on the auto side and, of course, on both the commercial lines that I've talked about is we're really going to focus on our four strategic pillars. The first one, our people and our culture, we're going to make sure we have the best work environment ever people that want to serve our customers, and in turn, they reward us with their loyalty. We're going to focus on our brand. So whether it's mass media, digital, making sure that we send out the message of savings and protection. We've continued that this year. I've talked a little bit about competitive prices. We care deeply about costs and taking costs out of the system so that when people do shop us because they love our brand, we convert. And of course, the industry-leading segmentation. And I talked about the broad coverage. So we're going to continue to focus on that. And we -- this year is going to be, again, another year where it's going to be really hard to compare because the odds are the denominator in March and April because there was relatively no shopping is pretty low. With that, my comment, I don't know exactly when the timing will hit, income tax returns, more stimulus payments, and we're ready and able to write those consumers. So there's going to be a lot of change. I think what we have be as well positioned and nimble as things change. And that's really what my team and I talk about at a time, are we ready for this? And so we'll constantly adjust our rate level to make sure we're competitive but also profitable, which is one of our core values. We talked about the different product models that we'll roll out. And some of the other items that we've done like our Snapshot Apron and other things to do to make sure our customers are taken care of. I know our CRM organization has something in place right now called more time to pay, where they really try to personalize that experience if someone just needs a little bit more time or needs some adjustments on their pay plan because we know retention is important, and we know it's important for our customers. So that's a long-winded answer. And I think there's going to be a lot of variables this year, and a lot of it will depend on at states open if frequency happens. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen. I think of the last pandemic, and when will the roaring 2021 to 2022, will people be out driving more. We just have to watch the data, and we're going to react really quickly to it."

But we're also, as Tricia said, work with our new risk and reinsurance leader, getting a little more holistic in terms of our risk appetite and making some changes upcoming to recognize a little more holistic perspective there. 
You might recall, we retained much of the reinsurance program in our property business for years because we had a minority interest there remaining, and their buyout was a function of book value. So there were some interest there in not raising that retention. And obviously, at our size and balance sheet, we could raise that and not incur any material risk to our balance sheet."

We appreciate you joining us. As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons, from the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused",1015,"Good afternoon, and welcome to Progressive's fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. As we stated during the past few quarters, 2020 was an extremely trying year for many reasons, from the global pandemic to the emotional toll caused by social unrest. As I reflect on the year we just closed, I couldn't be more proud of the way Progressive rose to these challenges by delivering fantastic results, while supporting its customers, employees, communities and partners during these unprecedented times.
The annual report theme of resilience truly defines how we approached every obstacle during this past year. As of prior quarters, the fourth quarter profitability continued to benefit from reduction in frequency, which was partially offset by an increase in severity. Miles driven continued to be lower than the fourth quarter last year. We continue to react to the changes in driving behavior caused by the pandemic. In addition to the over $1 billion given to customers in the form of credits early on in the pandemic, we also filed Personal Auto rate changes that averaged a decrease of approximately 3% between April and December in over 40 states that represent approximately 85% of our country-wide premium, thereby providing our customers an aggregate annualized savings estimated at about $800 million. 
There's much uncertainty about reopenings, vaccine distribution and if and when we'll return to pre-pandemic driving patterns. Our product teams are staying abreast of the situation and continue to adjust rates to related risks, which include risks such as weather. We continue to recognize both policy and premium growth in the fourth quarter, which combined with the rest of the year resulted in 2020 having an increase of 2.4 million policies in force and $3 billion more net premiums written over the prior year. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit PIF growth. While all of our segments contributed to this growth, our agency auto business was more heavily impacted by the federal, state and local social distancing and shelter-in-place restrictions that were put in place to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a decrease in new applications year-over-year. 
Our Commercial Lines business saw significant growth in the for-hire transportation business as the demand for shipping services grew as a result of the pandemic. On the other hand, our Uber and Lyft premiums took a hit during the year as miles driven decreased with restrictions in place, and our premiums are based on actual and estimated miles over the policy term. Our property business had a profitable fourth quarter, but with the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season being the most active on record, it recognized an underwriting loss for the full year. Growth continues to be strong with our bundled Robinson business growing faster than any other segment. We're confident that we have the pricing and product enhancements in place to get closer to our target margins, and will continue to make changes as we grow.  
Despite the challenges faced in light of the pandemic, our combination of strong growth and profitability in 2020 suggests we are managing the situation well. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our Personal Auto product. Our first sale was elevated to our newest product model in January. As part of our Apron Relief Program, we also launched a temporary change to Snapshot that allows existing non-Snapshot customers to receive a Snapshot adjusted rate after just 30 days of monitoring as opposed to the normal 6 months. This, in addition to Snapshot road test, which we had available for several months, gives consumers the ability to see their Snapshot rate before purchasing a policy. 
While not available country-wide, where it is available, we believe this is a perfect opportunity for some customers to lower their rates based on either the driving behavior or frequency of their driving habits that have changed as a result of the pandemic. We're also investing in our Commercial Lines business. Our BOP product is now active in 18 states. Illinois went live last week. And during the fourth quarter was added to our BusinessQuote Explorer platform in the direct channel. Also Smart Haul, our UBI program for truckers, continues to see excellent adoption rates and is a great asset in the for-hire trucking markets. And Snapshot ProView, which expands our UBI offerings beyond truck, is now available in 45 states.  
Looking to 2021, I'm happy to report that we are well positioned for further growth as reflected in our January results. We continue to make investments in pricing segmentation, cost efficiency, accurate claims handling and expense management. Most importantly, we've supported our people and retained our culture, which we know will pay huge dividends going forward. Another exciting thing about 2021 is that, in April, we will celebrate our 50th anniversary of becoming a public company. A fun fact, if you bought 100 shares at our IPO in 1971, it would have cost you $1,800. At the end of 2020, that initial investment would have grown to be worth over $19 million, a 20.5% compounded annual return. Not about investment, especially if you compare it to the 9.9% return by the S&P 500 over that same period. I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our shareholders, both past and present, for investing in us over the years. 
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to express how pleased and excited I am about the agreement with Protective Insurance Corporation. We've been very impressed with Protective's products, employees and culture. As we've said in the past, Commercial Lines is our greatest opportunity to grow, and we're excited to expand our capabilities with the expertise Protective offers at larger fleet and affinity programs and by providing additional breadth of product lines. As you know, the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we're not able to share additional information at this time. We will provide additional information, thoughts after the transaction closes. 
Chris, I think we can open it up for questions now."

It's a great question, Mike. And actually, what I just talked about when I did my opening remarks was something that came out of a discussion that John Sauerland and Pat Callahan and John Murphy and I had when we were talking about the desire to have people -- have the rate to risk be really relevant to people that are driving less. And so we really, in record time, created the Apron Relief Snapshot Program. And because time is of the essence, and maybe people are going back to work, maybe they're partially in work, partially not, we wanted to be able to provide our UBI program with a shortened monitoring period. So that 30-day period is really important. So we've sent out to our current customers millions of emails. And for those where we don't have the e-mail, we're sending out actual USPS mail to alert our customers of this offering and make sure that if they are driving less and they do want to receive a discount or their frequency and severity of driving those down, they can opt for this option. We think that's a fantastic addition to the credits that we gave early on, the rate reductions and our road test option for consumers."

And we make sure that when we acquire a customer that it's under our allowable cost or at or under our allowable costs. And so I can't go into a lot of the proprietary ways with which we do that. But we believe that allows us to have very reasonable acquisition cost, which we believe are much lower than in insurtech."

So we are looking very surgically at each state, channel and product to give the right discounts to make sure we manage that trade-off between growth and profitability. So I think that -- I'm assuming our competitors are doing similar things. For us, it really is about that balance of growth and profitability. And so we're pretty proud of the fact that, in 2020, even with the reduced rate and shopping down substantially during the first part of the pandemic that we were able to grow both in prospects and sales on a full year. So that's really our concentration. We obviously look across our competitor set to see if prices are down. John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this last February, we look at a few big competitors raised their -- prices are still down, premium is down about 1.7%. And so yes, I think it will continue to be a challenge to grow but we're up for that challenge, as you can see by our January results."

And in fact, over the years, I think, we've talked about the Horizons. And Horizon 2 is our biggest growth opportunity.

But we really do prefer to grow organically and have done so for the past 80-plus years."

Let me -- well, I was very satisfied with the property results in January and the fourth quarter. That, of course, does not take up the whole year. And if you take out weather-related, including cats and other weather, we feel like we're in a good position. So we've taken rates up substantially. We've changed our product model. We continue to have deeper segmentation. February is not going to be a great month for the industry because of the winter storm. And we tried to obviously put a load in for those events. And last year was another unprecedented year of hurricanes. So I'm happy with the product. I'm happy with our continued ability to segment. I'm happy with the fact that we're growing Robinsons across the board in both direct and the agency channel. We've increased our Platinum agents. And I think you're referring to the HomeQuote Explorer. Very happy there. 
So we sell Progressive Home, along with many other unaffiliated partners, and that's been a higher growth than even the agency channel. We're very excited about that. It's our highest growing segment. And when you think about having customers for life, that was really our basis for acquiring ARX, is to make sure that we have those auto home bundled, one to allow us to extend our auto policy life expectancy. So our retention, of course, is the holy grail, but also have those customers for life. So as their needs change, we had them. We didn't want to be the training wheels when people wanted homes. So those customers we see add on toys and life and other products that we're able to offer, either on our paper or not. And I will tell you, although we don't talk about this externally, the policy life expectancy on a Robinson versus some of the other segments are extraordinarily higher. And so we're very happy with that growth, and we'll continue to invest in that area."

Obviously, those are annual policies that all hasn't earned in. We've also taken steps to better balance where we're writing homes to ensure our storm risk is diversified. We've taken actions in terms of policy coverage as well to ensure that our interests are more aligned with our insurers when it comes to storm losses. So I think we've taken a lot of actions that should show benefits coming into this year. I expect we'll continue to take up rates this year. But as Tricia noted, it's surprising to know that February will be a tougher start to the year. But again, I think the Progressive Home team is taking the right actions to get profitability where we want it for home. And as Tricia noted, we are writing a lot more auto because we have home and the agency channel. You can think of over $1 billion of very profitable auto insurance that we believe we would not have had through agents were it not for the opportunity to bundle with Progressive."

And then, John, you can add anything you want. So remember, we have a different calendar. We don't go by the Gregorian calendar. In 2019, if you're looking at new apps in particular, it was a 53-week year, and quarter 4 was at 14-week quarter. So when you look at new app growth year-to-date -- or I should say, in agency, the fourth quarter was down maybe 1%, but it was up on the direct side, about 3%. If you look at last year for the quarter -- for quarter 3, it was down in agency about 4% and up in direct, about 8%. These are new apps in particular. You've seen our retention statistics. We're very proud of the fact that retention continues to increase. We also know part of that is because of the moratoriums and non-cancels. So we know a portion of that has to do with the pandemic, but we also believe that both what we're doing on the nature and nurture side will continue to reap benefits on the retention side. 
When I think of growth, it's -- we look at, obviously, PIF growth as our preferred measure because trends are going to change up and down depending on things. Obviously, the pandemic was dramatic. And we can't -- we have to react to our trends. And like I said at the beginning, even though no one took rates up last year, we continued to be able to grow new sales and prospects. How we think about it? On the auto side and, of course, on both the Commercial Lines that I've talked about is we're really going to focus on our four strategic pillars. The first one, our people and our culture. We're going to make sure we have the best work environment ever people that want to serve our customers, and in turn, they reward us with their loyalty. We're going to focus on our brand. So whether it's mass media, digital, making sure that we send out the message of savings and protection. We've continued that this year. 
I've talked a little bit about competitive prices. We care deeply about costs and taking costs out of the system, so that when people do shop us because they love our brand, we convert. And of course, the industry-leading segmentation. And I talked about the broad coverage. So we're going to continue to focus on that. And we -- this year is going to be, again, another year where it's going to be really hard to compare because the odds are the denominator in March and April because there was relatively no shopping is pretty low. With that, my comment -- I don't know exactly when the timing will hit. Income tax returns, more stimulus payments, and we're ready and able to write those consumers. So there's going to be a lot of change. I think what we have to be is well positioned and nimble as things change. And that's really what my team and I talk about at the time. Are we ready for this? 
And so we'll constantly adjust our rate level to make sure we're competitive but also profitable, which is one of our core values. We talked about the different product models that we'll roll out. And some of the other items that we've done like our Snapshot Apron and other things to do to make sure our customers are taken care of. I know our CRM organization has something in place right now called more time to pay, where they really try to personalize that experience if someone just needs a little bit more time or needs some adjustments on their pay plan because we know retention is important, and we know it's important for our customers. So that's a long-winded answer. And I think there's going to be a lot of variables this year, and a lot of it will depend on states open, if frequency happens. I mean, you don't know what's going to happen. I think of the last pandemic, and when will the roaring 2021s or 2022s be, where people will be out driving more. We just have to watch the data, and we're going to react really quickly to it."

You might recall, we retained much of the reinsurance program in our property business for years because we had a minority interest there remaining, and their buyout was a function of book value. So there were some interest there in not raising that retention. And obviously, at our size and balance sheet, we could raise that and not incur any material risk to our balance sheet."

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us.During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now",922,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us.
During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollouts brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next with a positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results.
This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19%, and we report a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable, with the exception of property, where cash profit weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continue to be strong at 12%, and I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004 that we reported double-digit growth in personal auto, special lines and commercial lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder that so many people trust Progressive's to protect some of their most important assets.
I'd like to take some time to address the effects the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons. 
This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects 2 items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of the pandemic, growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic.
Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, but not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released, which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth.
Also, starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our personal auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio.
In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our policy retention. Both policy in force counts and retention metrics were affected by billing leniency.
In Commercial Lines, our T&C business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021.
Our Property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, Property business suffered significant losses. Further, the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19.
I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was the desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic, one in which senior managers from around the organization would present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least 2 of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight Commercial Lines.
Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters.
Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question, Ditamara."

We have a very specific target margin for our property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick radar segmentation in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in home. So we have new product models. We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be year of roof. And we've also had some restrictions for customers in the state to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that, that really causes a lot.
In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1. And we have another 4.2 expected in quarter 2. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal.
Now what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is, without having a property product, we would not have gotten -- likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board, period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have, along with the industry, been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have heavily reinsurance on the property side to protect the downside. But no, we're not thrilled with those results.

Would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like -- and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. 
Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home, et cetera. as well as some of the other items we've talked about, the Apron Relief that I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving less the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate.

So yes, GEICO did -- Berkshire talked a lot about it. And they're a formidable competitor. And we like the competition because it makes us better, and it's better for customers.
Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now. And we're not going to stop. We believe rate to risk has a lot to do with many different variables. Insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many million miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the Commercial Auto side. So We like the competition. We think it's great.

So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and the people and culture at Progressive.

In your current pricing, are the inflation issues that are sort of kitchen table issues that everybody knows about? Is that captured in how you're pricing right now? Or is that going to contribute to future rates?"

I would say, on the rental coverage, especially for our first party, we have contracts in place to minimize the amount that you pay per day on a rental. So we feel good about that. We also believe on the rental side that if you get out there and see the car -- customers want their car back in their driveway. So we really do try to compress the time which to get the car back into at or better shape than before the accident. So we've always prided ourselves on the actual time that, that takes, which, of course, affects rental.
On lumber, we will start to see that unfold. And if we believe that it is a piece of the severity, we will price that in future rate increases."

And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices, your broad coverage gets you in the door. So we believe that we've obviously spent a lot more on brand, another 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we're spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad or you want to call in or you want to go to your agent, we try to be aware when and how you want to shop, just to make it easy for all customers.

They also do it recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So you can imagine, if we have a longer retaining customer and it's direct, we can spend more. If it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space, and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now.
The other important thing to do is, once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit the quoting process, and we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said, get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to a buy. So I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there."

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. No",921,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. 
During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollouts brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next with a positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. 
This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19%, and we report a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable, with the exception of property, where catastrophic weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continue to be strong at 12%, and I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004 that we reported double-digit growth in Personal Auto, special lines and Commercial Lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets. 
I'd like to take some time to address the effects the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons.  
This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects 2 items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of the pandemic, growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic. 
Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, though not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released, which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth. 
Also, starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our Personal Auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. 
In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our policy retention. Both policy in force counts and retention metrics were affected by billing leniency. 
In Commercial Lines, our T&C business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. 
Our Property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, Property business suffered significant losses. Further, the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. 
I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was the desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic, one in which senior managers from around the organization would present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least 2 of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight Commercial Lines. 
Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. 
Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question, Ditamara."

We have a very specific target margin for our Property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96%. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick radar segmentation in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in home. So we have new product models. We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be year of roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in the hail-prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that, that really causes a lot.
In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1. And we have another 4.2 expected in quarter 2. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal.
Now what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is, without having a property product, we would not have gotten -- likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board, period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have, along with the industry, been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have heavily reinsurance on the property side to protect the downside. But no, we're not thrilled with those results.

And we've talked off and on, too, about do we have continuous monitoring. Would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. 
Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home, et cetera. as well as some of the other items we've talked about, the Apron Relief that I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving less the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades. We'll continue to do so. We do so on both the Personal Auto and the Commercial Auto side, really happy with our Smart Haul results, very successful.

So yes, GEICO did -- or Berkshire talked a lot about it. And they're a formidable competitor. And we like the competition because it makes us better, and it's better for customers.
Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now. And we're not going to stop. We believe rate to risk has a lot to do with many different variables. Insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many million miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the Commercial Auto side. So we like the competition. We think it's great.
And now -- 10 years ago, I might not have said this, but now we have head-to-head brands. So you may like her or you may not, but you know who Flow is, and we're very proud of Flo, the network and all the different characters. So I think going head to head on all those things is a good thing. I've always been competitive, and we like that. I think it makes us better. It makes Sure that you don't just rest on your laurels. So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and the people and culture at Progressive. And we think all those together are really a winning formula."

And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door. So we believe that we've obviously spent a lot more on brand, another 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we're spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad or you want to call in or you want to go to your agent, we try to be aware when and how you want to shop, just to make it easy for all customers.

They also do it, recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So you can imagine, if we have a longer retaining customer and it's direct, we can spend more. If it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space, and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now.
The other important thing to do is, once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit the quoting process, and we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said, get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to a buy. So I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there."

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. No",921,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. 
During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollouts brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next with a positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. 
This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19%, and we report a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable, with the exception of property, where catastrophic weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continue to be strong at 12%, and I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004 that we reported double-digit growth in Personal Auto, special lines and Commercial Lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets. 
I'd like to take some time to address the effects the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons.  
This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects 2 items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of the pandemic, growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic. 
Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, though not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released, which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth. 
Also, starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our Personal Auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. 
In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our policy retention. Both policy in force counts and retention metrics were affected by billing leniency. 
In Commercial Lines, our T&C business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. 
Our Property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, Property business suffered significant losses. Further, the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. 
I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was the desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic, one in which senior managers from around the organization would present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least 2 of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight Commercial Lines. 
Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. 
Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question, Ditamara."

And then it's different depending on the type of customer that comes in, if things are bundled. We obviously have several thousand Platinum agents who get a higher commission because they are bundling the auto and home, those Robinsons customers. And if you bring in a -- some -- a group of customers that we believe are going to be there short term, the commission might be less. Again, the aggregate is we try to keep around 10%, 10.5%. And we also do have some preferred programs and bonuses for our agents depending on their loss performance. It's not across the board. It's with specific agents. Do you want to add anything, John?"

But the overarching objective here is to ensure we have competitive prices. That means we have to have competitive commissions as well as competitive other costs, what we call non-acquisition expense ratio or cost. And so really, it's the combination of go-to-market in terms of having a competitive aggregate expense ratio, both of those come into play. And obviously, a commission which we think our agents will thrive. So there has been downward movement from competitors, you're right. I think we have seen some positives to that, to some degree, because we are -- our commissions are more like competitive these days than perhaps they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact to that, if that's where you're going."

We have a very specific target margin for our Property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96%. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick radar segmentation in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in home. So we have new product models. We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be year of roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in the hail-prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that, that really causes a lot.
In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1. And we have another 4.2 expected in quarter 2. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal.
Now what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is, without having a property product, we would not have gotten -- likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board, period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have, along with the industry, been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have heavily reinsurance on the property side to protect the downside. But no, we're not thrilled with those results.

And we've talked off and on, too, about do we have continuous monitoring. Would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. 
Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home, et cetera. as well as some of the other items we've talked about, the Apron Relief that I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving less the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades. We'll continue to do so. We do so on both the Personal Auto and the Commercial Auto side, really happy with our Smart Haul results, very successful.

Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now. And we're not going to stop. We believe rate to risk has a lot to do with many different variables. Insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many million miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the Commercial Auto side. So we like the competition. We think it's great.
And now -- 10 years ago, I might not have said this, but now we have head-to-head brands. So you may like her or you may not, but you know who Flow is, and we're very proud of Flo, the network and all the different characters.

So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and the people and culture at Progressive.

That probably is explained by accurate matching of price and risk. But on the quote side, you're doing something powerful that gets people in the funnel in the first place. And you have a big flow of customers. So if I'm sitting at home, whether I have a stimulus check or not, maybe I'm a Robinsons. And at some point, I decided I'm going to go shopping. Just wondering, what's sort of the key ingredients of being successful at getting that customer in to get a Progressive quote?"

I think a lot of it is our brand. So we started out -- I started out one of the answers with 10 years ago, 11 years ago, our brand would be different. It's about awareness.

It's a solid brand. It's a reputable brand. So that's kind of awareness gets you on the short list. And then when you're on the short list and you shop our competitive prices and our broad coverage gets you in the door. So we believe that we've obviously spent a lot more on brand, another 25% increase in this quarter. And again, we're spending a lot in expanding our broad coverage. So if you're sitting on a couch and you're a Robinson and you want to buy an auto and home on your phone or your iPad or you want to call in or you want to go to your agent, we try to be aware when and how you want to shop, just to make it easy for all customers.
And those -- then you have competitive prices. So I think that is really important. And that goes, of course, into our segmentation and understanding rate to risk."

They also do it, recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So you can imagine, if we have a longer retaining customer and it's direct, we can spend more. If it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space, and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now.
The other important thing to do is, once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit the quoting process, and we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said, get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to a buy. So I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there."

On the agency side, we've increased our Platinum agents, have a little bit over 4,000 Platinum agents now. So again, more ability to buy those. On the -- we want to make money on the property side. And so we have been -- I think we're in 47 states now. We want to grow across the country. And for years, we were -- we had a lot of density in Texas, Florida, that area. And we continue to, but we also want to grow out of those and do the right thing in terms of segmentation. So our appetite is we want to grow as fast as we can. But our other part of that, of course, is we want to make our target profit margin.
So we look at those states, we look at ex cat to try to understand where we believe the underlying price is accurate. And as I said, we are increasing rates and trying to understand segmentation a little bit more deeply. So we want to grow there. We want to grow Robinsons. That's one of the reasons why we've made so many big investments, but we need to make money on that product."

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. No",921,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. 
During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollouts brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next with a positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. 
This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19%, and we report a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable, with the exception of property, where catastrophic weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continue to be strong at 12%, and I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004 that we reported double-digit growth in Personal Auto, special lines and Commercial Lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets. 
I'd like to take some time to address the effects the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons.  
This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects 2 items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of the pandemic, growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic. 
Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, though not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released, which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth. 
Also, starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our Personal Auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. 
In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our policy retention. Both policy in force counts and retention metrics were affected by billing leniency. 
In Commercial Lines, our T&C business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. 
Our Property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, Property business suffered significant losses. Further, the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. 
I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was the desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic, one in which senior managers from around the organization would present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least 2 of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight Commercial Lines. 
Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. 
Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question, Ditamara."

And obviously, a commission which we think our agents will thrive. So there has been downward movement from competitors, you're right. I think we have seen some positives to that, to some degree, because we are -- our commissions are more like competitive these days than perhaps they were previously, but we couldn't really tease out any specific impact to that, if that's where you're going."

I'm wondering if the view on the Property business at this point in time is more of a loss leader to drive retention in the Robinsons and so you're willing to sacrifice your margins in order to drive up retention. Or alternatively, do you also have this overarching objective to eventually get that business down to, I think, your corporate target is 96% combined ratio. Maybe it's lower because it's property, but some color there would be helpful."

We have a very specific target margin for our Property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96%. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick radar segmentation in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in home. So we have new product models. We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be year of roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in the hail-prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that, that really causes a lot.
In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1. And we have another 4.2 expected in quarter 2. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal.
Now what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is, without having a property product, we would not have gotten -- likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board, period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have, along with the industry, been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have heavily reinsurance on the property side to protect the downside. But no, we're not thrilled with those results. And we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal."

We've been working on that for a while, but we think it is an important next step for the use in our telematics. 
And we've talked off and on, too, about do we have continuous monitoring. Would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. 
Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home, et cetera. as well as some of the other items we've talked about, the Apron Relief that I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving less the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades. We'll continue to do so. We do so on both the Personal Auto and the Commercial Auto side, really happy with our Smart Haul results, very successful. And the program is very profitable on the Commercial Auto side because that's a big expense for truckers. But I mean, all of those things are on our agenda, and we continue to invest a lot in this area."

Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now. And we're not going to stop. We believe rate to risk has a lot to do with many different variables. Insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many million miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the Commercial Auto side. So we like the competition. We think it's great.
And now -- 10 years ago, I might not have said this, but now we have head-to-head brands. So you may like her or you may not, but you know who Flow is, and we're very proud of Flo, the network and all the different characters.

So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and the people and culture at Progressive. And we think all those together are really a winning formula."

They also do it, recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So you can imagine, if we have a longer retaining customer and it's direct, we can spend more. If it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space, and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now.
The other important thing to do is, once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume. There are multiple avenues where customers can decide to quit the quoting process, and we optimize continuously to make that funnel that starts at the top of the flow, as you said, get as efficient as possible to get them a quote and then obviously to translate that quote to a buy. So I think a lot of this is our great people, great analytical skills, massive data sets. And I think we're doing some impressive things there."

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. No",921,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's first quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us. 
During our fourth quarter call, we took the opportunity to reflect on 2020 and the emotional toll of the pandemic and social unrest. Now with the first quarter of 2021 behind us, we look forward with the optimism that the vaccine rollouts brings and the hope of a return to normalcy. Our people are showing tremendous resilience in the face of hardships and a willingness to react to whatever comes next with a positive attitude, which allow us to continue to deliver fantastic results. 
This quarter, our net premiums written growth was 19%, and we report a healthy combined ratio of 89.3. All lines were profitable, with the exception of property, where catastrophic weather losses added 30.6 points to the combined ratio. Policies in force growth continue to be strong at 12%, and I'm most excited to report that we passed the milestones of 17 million personal auto PIFs, 5 million special line PIFs and 25 million company-wide PIFs during the first quarter. I also want to point out that this is the first time since the second quarter of 2004 that we reported double-digit growth in Personal Auto, special lines and Commercial Lines policies in force. We couldn't be prouder that so many people trust Progressive to protect some of their most important assets. 
I'd like to take some time to address the effects the pandemic will have on our year-over-year comparative results for the next several months. March was the first month where we saw the effect of the pandemic in our previous year's results. So it feels like a good time to give some further insight into our March 2021 results and to remind everyone of the actions that we took in 2020 that could affect our year-over-year comparisons.  
This quarter, we reported 14% new app growth in Personal Lines and 29% new app growth in Commercial Lines. The year-over-year growth reflects 2 items: the effect of the stimulus package and the denominator that includes the onset of the pandemic in which shopping virtually stalled. Even considering the effects of the pandemic, growth is robust. We've often said that PIF growth is our preferred measure of growth. This is a great example why since the denominator was only nominally affected by the pandemic. 
Last year's new business metrics continue to be affected by the pandemic well into the summer of 2020, though not always negatively. In mid-April 2020, the first wave of stimulus checks were released, which restarted new business shopping. We expect the uptick in shopping last year will affect our second quarter 2021 year-over-year new business growth. 
Also, starting in April of last year, we took actions to support our customers, including our Apron Relief program, which we believe will have an impact on many key metrics, including our expense ratio. At the end of April and May of 2020, our Personal Auto customers received monthly premium credits of 20%, which provided substantial financial assistance to our customers, but also increased our expense ratio. 
In addition, as part of the Apron Relief Program, we initiated payment and billing leniency, which temporarily increased our bad debt expense, but also increased our policy retention. Both policy in force counts and retention metrics were affected by billing leniency. 
In Commercial Lines, our T&C business saw a sudden and dramatic decrease in miles driven and estimated future miles be driven in March of 2020, which contributed to the significant Commercial Lines net premiums written increase in March of 2021, as noted in our March release. Miles driven in those premiums slowly recovered over the course of 2020, so we anticipate the effect on the denominator will decrease over the remainder of 2021. 
Our Property results continue to be rocked by catastrophic losses. In the first quarter, which is normally a relatively quiet quarter for cat losses, Property business suffered significant losses. Further, the hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma that occurred in late April appear to be another large event. While it's too early to assess our ultimate exposure, I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have an $80 million retention threshold from a single storm under our occurrence excess of loss reinsurance program. We'll have more details on the late April events in our April release, which is currently scheduled for May 19. 
I'd also like to take a moment to thank everyone who participated in the perception study we commissioned at the beginning of the year. It was encouraging to see all the positive comments we received and helpful to receive feedback on ways we can improve. One opportunity that we heard loud and clear was the desire to return to the quarterly call format we had before the pandemic, one in which senior managers from around the organization would present on various aspects of the business. We intend to return to this format during at least 2 of the calls each year, starting with the August call, where we will highlight Commercial Lines. 
Looking forward into the rest of 2021, I'm filled with a sense of optimism. While the pandemic is far from over and we still have many challenges ahead of us, I think pride in the strength of our business, the resilience of our people and have confidence that the plans we have in place will likely continue to deliver great results in the coming quarters. 
Thank you. And I'm ready to take the first question, Ditamara."

We have a very specific target margin for our Property business that, as you stated, rolls up to our 96%. We've just been riddled with a lot of catastrophes. It's also a fairly newer business for us in terms of segmentation. So if you look at over the years how much we've improved and continued to improve at a really quick radar segmentation in auto, we anticipate we'll do that in home. So we have new product models. We have our R&D group working on the right product models, which could be year of roof. And we've also have some restrictions for customers in the hail-prone states to have them buy relatively higher deductibles for wind and hill because we've seen that, that really causes a lot.
In addition, we have done a lot of rate increases. So in 2020, we took about 11.5 points, another close to 1.5 in Q1. And we have another 4.2 expected in quarter 2. So we continue to raise rates to ultimately get to that goal.
Now what we're happy with, and I wrote it in my letter, is the fact that we are getting a high percentage of bundled customer on both the direct and agency side. And what we know on the agency side is, without having a property product, we would not have gotten -- likely have not gotten most of those autos. So we want those, but we want to make our target margins across the board, period. So that's what we're working towards. We really have, along with the industry, been rocked with catastrophes. And of course, we also have heavily reinsurance on the property side to protect the downside. But no, we're not thrilled with those results. And we're going to continue to chip away to get to our ultimate goal."

I think we have about 150,000 customers that are currently -- that we currently have access to claims information should they have a loss. And we'll have more to come on that. We've been working on that for a while, but we think it is an important next step for the use in our telematics. 
And we've talked off and on, too, about do we have continuous monitoring. Would that help not only with understanding the likelihood of changing driving behavior, but also could help with other necessary things that customers have grown accustomed to in terms of added services like tows and gas stations and things like that. So that is on our list as well. 
Currently, obviously, during the pandemic, our big effort was to try to understand vehicle miles driven and how that relates to work from home versus not work from home, et cetera. as well as some of the other items we've talked about, the Apron Relief that I've talked about in terms of actually a shorter monitoring period to give people who believe that they're driving less the ability to improve that through data and give them a lesser rate. But we've been on the UBI bandwagon for a couple of decades. We'll continue to do so. We do so on both the Personal Auto and the Commercial Auto side, really happy with our Smart Haul results, very successful. And the program is very profitable on the Commercial Auto side because that's a big expense for truckers. But I mean, all of those things are on our agenda, and we continue to invest a lot in this area."

I guess, if we combine those 2 things and credit score may start to fade away in other states and then their use of telematics may start to pick up, how do you think about that competitive dynamic between you and them in states as the overall market shifts away from credit and they start to shift more towards telematics?"

Here's how we think about segmentation. We have -- we've had an edge on a lot of our competitors for many, many years now. And we're not going to stop. We believe rate to risk has a lot to do with many different variables. Insurance credit scores being one of them. Usage-based insurance being one of them, but there are a lot of other variables. We will comply with the regulators. We believe they help to match rate to risk, and they're correlated to ultimate losses, which is really important for all consumers to keep the rates competitive. So I'm not surprised that they are going to spend more money on that. We also will be spending more money on continuation of our many, many million miles of Snapshot data on both the auto side and the Commercial Auto side. So we like the competition. We think it's great.
And now -- 10 years ago, I might not have said this, but now we have head-to-head brands. So you may like her or you may not, but you know who Flow is, and we're very proud of Flo, the network and all the different characters. So I think going head to head on all those things is a good thing. I've always been competitive, and we like that. I think it makes us better. It makes Sure that you don't just rest on your laurels. So we will react to whatever we need to react and continue to invest in segmentation, especially in usage-based insurance, but other segmentation variables as well as our brand, our broad coverage and the people and culture at Progressive.

They also do it, recognizing the lifetime value of the prospects that are looking to quote. So you can imagine, if we have a longer retaining customer and it's direct, we can spend more. If it's shorter, you get the whole concept there. So I think we are pretty good in that space, and that has been a space that has been growing for us a lot for a number of years now.
The other important thing to do is, once you get the person in the front door, you got to get them to the price. And that is not as simple as you might assume.

This construct allows us to focus and make investments that drive value to the organization and all of our constituents. Who we are? Which are our 5 core values? Peter Lewis wrote these back in 1987, and they have served us well over the decades. Specifically during this past 1.5 years, as we've navigated completely foreign waters and have made decisions on behalf of all of our constituents, we have used our core values as a guide. I won't go into all that we did because I've publicly written about much of it, but suffice it to say, we believe all along the way we did the right thing.
Why we're here. Our purpose statement, which is True to our name, Progressive. We believe this statement is about forward progress, innovation and never resting on our past performance.
Where we're headed, our vision, which is to become consumers and agents #1 choice and insurance needs with us now and as those needs evolve. We know that we must earn their trust every day in order to achieve this vision.
How we'll get there, our strategy and more specifically, our 4 strategic pillars, which is how we think explicitly about investing to ultimately achieve our vision. I'll briefly give you a high-level overview of how we think about each pillar.
People and culture. Our goal is to ensure our people and culture collectively remain our most powerful source of competitive advantage, including attracting and hiring new talent, retain the people we have and developing everyone so that we can all have long and prosperous careers. We will support our people and culture by ensuring our people can bring their whole selves to work through our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Broad needs. We will meet the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetimes by being available where, when and how our customers want to interact with us. Helping our customers select the best insurance for their current needs as well as their evolving insurable needs throughout their lifetime.
Leading brand. We will maintain the leading brand recognized for innovative offerings and supported by experiences that instill confidence with messages that resonate.
Competitive pricing. We will offer competitive prices by pricing rate to risk through our industry-leading segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy in claims and finding ways to continually drive cost down through process changes and technology advances.
Our agenda will be in 3 sections, and we'll cover the commercial auto market and trends in the industry, including our performance relative to the market. We'll do a market overview that will outline our long-term growth plans. And finally, an update on market capabilities and expanding our product offering.
Before we begin our deep dive Commercial Lines agenda, I do want to acknowledge that we're highly cognizant of the fact that we reported a 100.5 combined ratio for June and are have been taking steps to ensure profitability as we come out of the pandemic. Commercial Lines is a huge opportunity for Progressive. So I don't want to draw attention away from the very important agenda Karen and Yoke and have for you, upcoming by offering prepared comments on results. I expect we'll have the opportunity in Q&A to share steps we've taken and are in the process of undertaking to ensure we achieve our calendar year 96 or better underwriting margin objective. 
Let's kick off the first section by talking about the addressable market. When we began these webcasts many years back, we started with showing the property and casualty addressable market, and we discussed our plans for both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines. Our Commercial Lines offerings have evolved over time, and of course, we recently acquired Protective Insurance. So we thought this was a good time to give you a more detailed update.
To summarize the entire market, you'll see in the center of the slide that the total property and casualty market is $730 billion. The progressive share, 5.7% is reflected in both the blue section of the donuts and the blue percentages. The gray reflects the industry.
On the Personal Lines side, we have a 9.6% of the $366 billion market, split between personal auto at 12.9% share and homeowners at 1.7% share. We've had massive growth here, but still plenty of room to grow.
The Commercial Lines addressable market is $364 billion and includes a wide array of opportunities. The commercial auto opportunity alone is a $46 billion market where we hold the #1 position with plenty of room to grow at 12.1% share with a large other commercial addressable market of $318 billion. At this point in time, the market that we believe we can both play and win in is approximately $78 billion.
If you start near the top of the circle and go clockwise, that entails monoline commercial auto, small fleet, transportation network companies, commercial auto bundled with GL/BOP, small business with GL/BOP, medium and large fleet with protective and workers' comp with protective. The addressable market that we aren't currently in include public transportation, larger commercial multi-peril businesses with over 20 employees and products like mortgage guaranty and marine, just to name a few. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and that we started investing in many years ago to set us up for future growth.
We've shared these 2x2 charts a few times. As a reminder, the x-axis is the combined ratio on an inverted scale. So you want to be to the right of 100. The y-axis is net written premium growth. So you want to be above the black line showing positive growth. Together, you want to be in the top right-hand shaded area where we're growing market share at or below a 96 combined ratio. The blue dot is progressive. The black dot is the industry and the gray dots are the others in the top 10 each year since 2015 through 2020. As we reflect in the past 6 years, we've consistently been in that area, growing market share and achieving at least a 96 combined ratio. In fact, on both profitability and growth, we frequently beat the industry in any individual competitor by wide margins.
I think to get into the meat of the program, but before I do that, I'll give some background on our speakers. I think many of you have met Karen before. Karen Bailo is our Commercial Lines President. She's been with Progressive for over 30 years with her most recent role as General Manager of Acquisition and Small Business Insurance. Karen has held several other significant leadership positions, including Personal Lines GM, Commercial Lines controller. And most notably, she spent 9 years building our agency distribution organization and positioning Progressive as a preferred supplier in that channel. Karen started her career in customer service as a management trainee and like others on our executive team, she was a claims rep early in her Progressive career. A graduate of the University of South Carolina. Karen earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with a minor in statistics and shoot to earn an MBA from Case Western Reserve University.
Jochen Schunter began his career progressive in 2006 after moving to Cleveland, Ohio from Southern Germany. He's an alumnus of both the University of Dayton, where he earned an MBA and of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlingan Nirenberg, where he earned Bachelors and Masters degree in the yards. After doing rounds in both the accounting and analyst rotational programs at Progressive, Jochen joined Commercial Lines in 2008. He started out in various pricing and control functions and then moved into product management. First, he managed several states, including California and our market entry into Hawaii and then took on bigger responsibilities as the leader of our truck product. During his tenure, he significantly contributed to increasing our market share by rolling out numerous product enhancements and also improving segmentation. Now as Commercial Lines controller, Jochen leads the organization responsible for ensuring we run a profitable business. This includes strategy and performance monitoring, risk analysis, data and analytics, rate setting, compliance and recovery as well as finance and accounting.
I'll now hand it over to Karen to outline our Commercial Lines trends."

While our June results include protective based on our closing date of June 1 for the purposes of this presentation, unless otherwise stated, the numbers exclude protective. I'd like to begin with a look at our performance relative to the industry.
This is a 20-year time series of progressive commercial auto net written premium growth rate versus the rest of the industry. During this time period, our results have really diverged from the industry. There are a couple of observations around growth that I'd like to highlight.
First, commercial auto has some cyclicality to it and tends to move with the larger economy. And second, when the market grows, Progressive has historically grown at a faster pace. In fact, since 2016, we've doubled the business and gained almost 4 points of market share, and that equates to more than 20% compounded growth rate and achieving more than 12% market share.
The more significant divergence from the market has been an underwriting profit. We've outperformed the industry by 8 to 10 and as much as 20 points over those 20 years. Our objective is to grow as fast as we can at target combined ratios. And we've had a track record of success and outperformed the industry on both growth and profit over those 20 years.
There's a number of contributing factors, but perhaps most important has been the intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business for the company. We've shared this information in the past and wanted to provide a brief refresher on how we approach our auto business. We segment our business into what we refer to as business market targets. And we introduced these business market targets for commercial auto in 2014.
Since introduced, BMTs are now operationalized across virtually every aspect of our business. That's important because we see meaningful and actionable differences between these BMTs. For example, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function responds to changes in different economic conditions is different. We also see that losses present differently and how they develop, attorney representation rates and litigation outcomes differ by BMT. Certainly, frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT. All of which are critical inputs to determining rate level. This granular focus allows us to develop insights faster, be more responsive with strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share.
I want to talk about what we're observing in shopping, loss trends and how we're positioned for continued success. We have the benefit of over 10 billion miles of driving data with our telematics data. This chart shows patterns in driving miles, highway congestion and highway speeding pre and post pandemic. You can see that as stay-at-home orders were issued, there was a significant decrease in miles driven and congestion on the highway. At the same time, there was an increase in highway speeding. Now while the impact from COVID on small businesses was severe, when we look at our business class level data, it's also clear that different businesses were affected differently. For example, in the truck space, fully 1/3 of our Smart Haul customers saw their mileage increase, while about 8% were shut down completely. Landscapers and most construction trades were still working and other service businesses were not.
Looking at more recent trends. While we see mileage and congestion back to pre-COVID levels, speeding events haven't dropped back to where they were. This raises the question around whether COVID brought a permanent change to truckers driving habits and is something we'll keep a close eye on in the months to come.
In addition to our own data, we look to other macroeconomic trends to develop a deeper understanding of shopping and small business trends, especially during challenging economic conditions. This chart shows our shopping trends, in this case, agency growth for businesses that tie to goods and services sectors indexed to 2019. Progressive quote data is in the solid line, and consumer spend data is in the dotted line. Our experience tracks closely to the rate of consumer spending on goods and services. So this is data we have and we'll continue to monitor.
The macroeconomic data shows spending on goods recovered more quickly, while the services sector has lagged and has been more depressed relative to good sectors. Some of that is because services sectors were more affected by stay-at-home orders and good spending has been supported by federal government stimulus. That intuitively makes sense, and we see that in our underlying data.
Businesses that were considered more essential, plumbing or sanitation services or those that tie to the transportation of goods like agriculture hauling or livestock hauling, responded differently versus those that are tied to services industries like airport shuttles, food trucks and entertainers. The positive news is that as the service businesses reopen, we're seeing a recovery in spending towards 2019 levels. This increase in spending on services should drive a rebound in insurance shopping for businesses related to that sector. Again, food trucks, restaurant delivery, airport shuttles, just to name a few.
In summary, different businesses have been affected differently. And this is important in terms of how we think about trends, the implications for frequency and severity and ultimately rate level going forward.
In our last update in 2019, we shared a historical perspective that provides a good illustration of how we will approach today's environment. Back in 2016, we saw a marked increase in frequency between May and November. At the same time, some prior year reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We responded quickly to address those trends, raising rates by more than 10% and made a series of underwriting changes in about 3 months, and we've continued with a series of changes and adjustments since.
Fast forward to recent trends, you can clearly see the impact of COVID on frequency. We saw a sharp decline in frequency as stay-at-home orders went into effect. And as I shared earlier, driving miles from our usage-based insurance data shows driving miles and congestion levels are back to prepandemic levels. And the services sectors are also rebounding. Given all of those conditions, we're seeing loss frequency rising relative to COVID lows when frequency fell dramatically. And at the same time, we continue to see a steady increase in severity trends that we've been accounting for in our rate level indications.
Given the variation in how businesses were affected by the pandemic, some slowing down and others seeing an increase in business, we have been and plan to continue to be cautious in our actions. We haven't lowered rates, and we've been conservative in our pricing and underwriting decisions. The trends we're observing now are lining up with what's forecasted in our rate level indications. We have planned for frequency recovery and a continued steep severity trend and have kept pace with net trends with a combined rate increase of 29% from the beginning of 2016 through the first half of this year.
The additional segmentation we've built into the product over the last 5 years has proven effective and driven better than industry underwriting results and growth. And I would suggest having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see. While much of the market is slower to react has been an important part of maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business over the years. So we continue to advance our product segmentation and underwriting capabilities, and we plan to continue to respond appropriately to loss trends going forward.
I'd like to shift to a discussion on expenses and efficiency. Now we know from experience that companies that can achieve a lower cost structure, gain share at a greater rate than the overall industry. We've seen that in the Personal Lines market and believe it matters in the Commercial Lines market as well. The correlation of efficiency aiding and growth isn't lost on us, and we're well positioned on this chart.
Now 2020 results show that we're nearly 11 points lower than the industry average in LAE and expense ratio. In a very price-sensitive industry, that 11-point advantage is significant. But there's a balance. We don't necessarily want to be the lowest because we believe and also investing in what matters. Quality outcomes for customers that earn loyalty and investments that foster great work environments for our employees.
To that end, I'd like to highlight where we're making investments to improve on both those fronts. This is a view of our expense ratio track record over a 10-year time period. And over that time period, we've seen a 7 to 8-point expense advantage compared to the industry. That advantage was 6 points in 2020 due in part because COVID credits flowed through expenses rather than premium, resulting in a slight elevated expense ratio. While we've had an expense advantage over this time period, we're prioritizing initiatives to extend our leadership position. There are a number of levers that drive expense ratio advantages. And while we don't have enough time for a comprehensive review of all the efforts underway, I wanted to share with you 2 examples that demonstrate active cost management efforts to drive expense reductions and improve experiences at the same time. These both highlight our focus in managing expenses related to our growth and improving our operational efficiency.
We maintain a disciplined focus on managing overhead and growth in headcount as we grow the business. This chart is designed to represent a few things. The solid blue line represents overall net earned premium growth. The solid orange line represents employee costs and real estate costs are represented in the solid black line. You can see that while employee costs and real estate costs have gone up, they've grown at a lower rate relative to net earned premium. And there are a couple of reasons for that. 
One is being disciplined and judicious in decisions to increase staff. We've added the dotted lines here to represent volume-driven and nonvolume-driven employee growth. And while we've grown our volume-driven counts in line with our net earned premium pace, we've been very targeted in adding nonvolume-driven resources, and our nonvolume-driven employee count has grown at a much lower rate. This discipline has resulted in growing our total employee cost, the orange line, less the net earned premium growth. 
The second is related to real estate. Like Personal Lines, prior to the pandemic, our customer and agent services organization enabled real estate expense savings by implementing a home-based consultant model. This model has a number of benefits. It provides broader access to talent and improved our ability to increase staff to support our growing business, especially last year, and it's also provided flexibility that employees value. In addition, this model allows us to grow our business without a commensurate growth in space. In 2019, almost 40% of our Commercial Lines agents and customer services consultants were working from home. Now we're still working through our plans as we transition back to the office post pandemic. We expect the portion of our customer and agent services consultants that work from home to grow materially as people make the decision to remain working from home going forward. This will support our ability to grow without significantly growing our real estate footprint.
The second example of our cost management efforts highlights investments in systems and technology to deliver the products and services our agents and customers value while focusing on increasing operational efficiency. We've been investing significantly in systems to support our core auto business and in expanding our business with our bot product and direct small business capabilities. Despite significant investments in technology and systems, we've been able to maintain our expense advantage. And we acknowledge and expected this relatively short-term increase in technology costs to lower our costs in the long run with gains in efficiency and new lines of business.
Now improving efficiency to push our expense advantage is a key objective. Two examples of progress are shown here. We've shared in previous annual report commentary that we're transitioning to a new policy administration system. And this new system is a significant driver of our technology expenses and rolling out the new system is a big part of our ability to drive more efficiency.
The new system introduces more modern functionality that enables faster delivery of our products and enhancements and the ability to improve customer experiences and self-service capabilities. The initial launch of this new system in estate brings consumer online buying capabilities. The chart on the left shows the total lift in direct online sales yield with our new system. 
Now completely isolating the effects of the online buy capabilities is difficult. But we're seeing an 80% improvement in online sales yield after introducing this new system. And that would translate to more than a 20% increase in direct auto sales. Now while direct is still a relatively small portion of our business. We expect this added functionality to bring long-term economic benefit to us in terms of improved sales yield and lower acquisition costs for that part of our business. And that's very important as this business grows.
A second way we're gaining efficiency is via process automation. On the right is a representation of improvements and we've already made reducing the manual work associated with millions of documents we receive every year via fax, e-mail or paper mail. Until recently, each document had to be manually reviewed and categorized for action, either to be attached to a policy and sent directly to storage or put in queue for additional processing. Over half of these documents are in that first group. They don't require any action beyond archival. We have a project underway to automate that workflow by the end of the year using optical character recognition technology, to review those documents automatically and attach them to a policy and send them to storage without human intervention. And this frees up resources to focus on other more value-added work. These are just 2 examples to illustrate how we will focus future investments.
Now while we're pleased with our early progress, we're just getting started, and we have a robust road map ahead of us that will target more efficiency improvements and self-service capabilities designed to meet customer and agent expectations. Investments in product, experiences and more efficient workflows combined should enable us to reduce the drivers of costs to service our customers. We anticipate that by lowering our costs, we will be able to further extend our expense advantage and position us well for any market conditions.
Now moving on to the other part of our expense advantage. We believe our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on commercial auto vis-a-vis our competition. We've doubled the core auto business while maintaining very competitive loss adjustment expense ratios and good quality. Our claims advantage comes from a surgical focus on claims accuracy and efficiency. And back in 2019, we shared how our claims organization leverages the scale of our broader Personal Lines claims organization with a focus on specialization for high-impact and complex claims. We continue to push Commercial Lines specialization as we grow our business. And we also see significant potential in leveraging technology and analytics to increase productivity and claims handling segmentation along with improving accuracy.
I wanted to share a brief example to illustrate how we're leveraging data, data science and advanced analytics to monitor and react to claims activity and exposure changes. The image on this slide represents a homegrown tool developed to inform leaders of claims that need review. The tool is powered by a file intervention program that uses analysis and data science to populate the tool and is designed to improve a leader's focus on at-risk files. This helps improve claims accuracy through better coaching and supports timely claim handling efforts. We know handling delays can result in unfavorable outcomes. And the alerts are prioritized and trigger on the best date for the leader to intervene for the most favorable results.
In this example, you see a code FS13 with the description potential for delayed total loss resolution. In this example, an alert triggered on March 19 with a message indicating a potential delay in resolving a total loss settlement. The leader intervenes by providing guidance to the claim rep on the open activity on the file. And since the leader intervened, the trigger is programmed to return 2 days later to make sure the claim rep is following up on the guidance provided. The next alert triggers on March 21. The leader reviews the file and sees that the claim rep followed up on the direction provided, so no additional intervention is needed at this point in time. The leader indicates no to the intervention question in the lower left. And once no intervention is selected, an alert is programmed to return 8 days later if the total loss is still not resolved. In this case, the total loss resolved on March 25, and so the alert didn't return for the third time. This is a powerful tool that helps our claims teams efficiently run the business of claims and contribute to more timely and accurate claims handling.
A final point on our performance relative to the industry is related to reserving where our philosophy is to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation. This chart shows our commercial auto reserve development versus the industry, and we have a much tighter variance. And we see 2 primary reasons for this. One contributing factor is the claims organization we just talked about. Leveraging technology and advanced analytics to increase productivity and get the right claims to the right resource more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better outcomes.
The other contributing factor is the highly segmented approach we take to loss reserving for commercial auto as we do with our other products. We've operationalized that BMT structure, in addition to the usual loss cost cuts, and it allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. Having more consistent and predictable loss cost estimates through accurate reserving lets us understand our true ultimate cost faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements.
So that's a little background on what we've been seeing in our commercial auto results recently and why we've been able to produce some different outcomes relative to the industry.
I'd now like to turn it over to Jochen Schunter, who will share a little about our plans for extending our leadership in commercial auto, including how and where protective insurance fits into those plans."

I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our commercial auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make.Let me start by talking a little bit about our 2 telematics programs that we have",1902,"Thank you, Karen. I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our commercial auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make.
Let me start by talking a little bit about our 2 telematics programs that we have in market today, Smart Haul and Snapshot ProView. We're proud to say that we have recently surpassed $500 million of commercial auto premium in force from these telematics-based programs and that we've analyzed over 10 billion miles of data. Smart Haul is our truck-focused telematics program that leverages the data from federally mandated electronic logging devices or ELD for short. Pilla federal mandate, most over-the-road truckers need an ELD to manage their hours of service. Smart Haul uses driving data from a trucker's existing ELD in exchange for a discount on the insurance of up to 18%. And while conversion is nearly double our normal truck conversion, we continue to see a sizable loss ratio advantage for this book even after applying those steep discounts, which average about $1,500 per policy. It's clear. This is good business and it's all incremental and verifiable segmentation that we're able to apply at point of sale.
To demonstrate how powerful this segmentation has proven to be, I'd like to draw your attention to the chart on the left. Telematics is the most predictive variable in our for-hire transportation segment. The depicted bar includes the power of new variables, enabled by telematics in addition to variables that can be derived from telematics, such as territory or zone. As you can see, telematics is, by far, our most predictive rating variable. And we have plans to further evolve the model by adding even more predictiveness to it. Our continued research of driving data is allowing us to constantly evolve and improve the model.
Switching over to our other telematics program, Snapshot ProView. We have a program that provides discounts and complementary fleet management features to our non-ELD customers. While this program is much younger, we already see the segmentation power of telematics, especially in segments where driving panels vary significantly from risk to risk.
The chart on the slide shows the average drive time for select business classes and their variance around that average. Let's pick the restaurant business class as an example. We have ensured that use their vehicle close to 5 hours a day, likely to deliver food. At the same time, we have restaurants that used the vehicle less than 1 hour a day. You can imagine last cars may look very different for those 2 use cases. That's just 1 example, how telematics data can help us create new segmentation as we create new insights from the 10 billion miles of collected data.
Next, I'd like to highlight some of the most significant milestones we've been able to achieve in commercial auto over the years that we're especially proud of. First, in 2008, we became the largest write-off truck insurance in the United States. In 2015, we became the #1 writer of commercial auto overall. In 2019, we became the #1 writer of preferred truck in the nonfleet space. I'll talk more about that in a minute. And lastly, this year, we passed $6 billion in net written premium, making us more than 2x the size of our next closest competitor based on trailing 12-month statutory data.
As mentioned on the prior slide, we've made big strides in growing our preferred truck book, enabling us to become the #1 write-off nonfleet preferred truck in 2019. We define preferred truck as motor carriers that have a track record of being financially responsible with 3 or more yields in business and a strong safety record. Based on our analysis, we grew our estimated share of nonfleet preferred truck from 5.9% in January of 2016 to 15.4% in May of 2021. On a direct written premium basis, that reflects an annual growth rate of 29.5% over that same 5-year time period. We did so by launching product enhancements that improved our competitiveness while hitting our annual calendar year profit targets each of those yields. Those investments have helped us improve consideration amongst the most preferred truckers shopping for insurance. In fact, of all the nonfleet preferred motor carriers that require a federal filing that switched insurance carriers in 2021 without a lapse in coverage, we got quoted on 48.2% of them. That number is up from 35.3% in Q1 of 2016. With this success, we continue to pursue a robust road map to enhance our product and coverage offerings along with improved segmentation, allowing us to offer even lower rates for the best risk.
Another exciting opportunity to grow our business across all BMTs is targeted at businesses with 10 to 40 vehicles. The small fleet market is about a $7 billion market where we have low penetration and only began increasing our focus on and investing in over the last couple of years. As we increased our focus, we saw opportunities to improve our pricing and add fleet-specific segmentation to provide more competitive rates to the best fleet risks. In addition, we expanded our underwriting team to support new underwriting capabilities, ensure appropriate pricing and accelerate the underwriting process. Today, we have the segmentation, assets and capabilities to compete effectively in this attractive market.
As you can see on the left chart, we've been able to more than triple our fleet book over the last 5 years with a meaningful acceleration in the last year. The right funnel chart shows the impact of improvements we've been able to elevate just in the last year driving that growth. While we've been able to increase growth by 19% in the trailing 12 months, we've been able to increase bindable quotes by 85% and ultimately, sales by 92%.
Let me cover some of the specific improvements that have allowed us to achieve those results. First, we brought and continue to bring automation and technology to the quoting process, helping us to increase efficiency. Specifically, we've automated the review of the supplemental application intake of this data into our database, underwriting review processes and related agent follow-up. We've also been able to improve the quote term around time by simplifying the quote process and leveraging our distribution organization to educate agents, which in turn is driving agent engagement, more completed quotes and increased conversion.
With our continued investments, we believe we're well positioned to continue our growth in the small fleet space. Talking about investments in small fleet, that's a great transition to highlight our plans to move even further upstream in the fleet market. That's where our recent acquisition of Protective Insurance fits in.
Before we get to talking about how Protective will help us grow fleets, let's spend a few minutes and talk about Protective, the products Protective offers and customers they serve. Let's start with some background. Protective Insurance is located in common Indiana, employing about 500 people. The company has nearly 100 years of experience of providing innovative insurance solutions primarily for the fleet trucking operations. Protective operates several statutory insurance companies, which are collectively licensed in all 50 states. While Protective will benefit from Progressive's strong balance sheet and financial strength, Progressive will benefit from many of Protective's unique capabilities, allowing it to successfully serve the fleet market. Let's talk about some of those capabilities and the protective product suite.
Protective sales, many of the lines we're very familiar with including commercial auto physical damage, commercial auto liability, nontrucking liability, cargo and general liability. In addition, and very critical to fleets coverage needs, protective alphas workers' comp and occupational accident. Two coverages that are very additive to Progressive's offering. In fact, workers comp reflects the largest statutory commercial coverage in terms of premium, even bigger than commercial auto. As mentioned on the prior slide, this is done through a variety of statutory entities and distribution channels.
Next, let's cover what customers Protective sales. While we just talked about Progressive's #1 position in truck overall, it's important to note that we've achieved that position primarily by dominating the less than 10 vehicle space. Only recently have we begun investing into our fleet product, becoming competitive for fleets of up to 40 total vehicles, inclusive of trailers. We're early in that journey. And while we've hit some major milestones and seen some encouraging growth, we realized that there are needed capabilities we would have to build to effectively compete for medium and large fleets. Protective delivers those capabilities, allowing us to move upstream. Those include sophisticated risk retention mechanisms, allowing fleets to participate in the risk and indemnity; safety and loss control programs, along with underwriting expertise; and lastly, rating by mileage and revenue.
Independent contractors in the FedEx Affinity program are amongst many of Protective's other customers engaged in the rapidly growing last mile delivery space. A sector, we expect to continue to expand over the coming years.
Switching to profitability. Protective has had a long track record of generating excellent results, meeting their respective profit targets over decades. Similarly to Progressive, in doing so, they were able to outperform the commercial auto industry consistently. While the last few years have been challenged from a profitability perspective, we strongly believe that the right actions have been taken to return to those industry-leading combined ratios. Specifically, Protective has refocused on its core business, which is transportation insurance. In addition, significant rate was taken to account for the industry's steep severity trends. We believe this focus on core products and rate take are already proving to be successful with the last few quarters showing constant improvement of underwriting results.
In addition, Protective has reinsurance in place to protect from significant adverse development from prior accident yields. Those reinsurance treaties ensure that retained severities and tails are consistent with Progressive established risk appetite.
Finally, I'd like to talk about how protective is additive to Progressive's product offering and allows us to expand our addressable market. Clearly, while we're both heavily focused on the commercial auto line, we do so with minimal overlap. Progressive is the market leader in the small transportation space, while Protective is a leader in the medium and large transportation fleet space. Together, we're able to serve that market in its entirety and with Protective's workers' comp capabilities, we're able to establish a foothold into that critical coverage. A coverage that is considered an anchor product in the small, medium and large fleet space. We look forward to further complementing each of ours product offering, enabling both entities to grow market share collectively.
Lastly, while we are still early in this acquisition, we look forward to what we call preserve and learn for the remainder of the year before focusing on further integrating our commercial offerings under the Progressive Commercial Lines umbrella. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that we intend to maintain the common, Indiana operation. This acquisition has always been about growing addressable markets and therefore, revenue collectively beyond what each of us would be able to achieve individually.
With that, I'd like to go back to a slide Tricia shared earlier. This slide shows our addressable market, which has grown to $78 billion with this acquisition, which reflects an increase of more than 25%.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Karen, who will cover our investments in the small business insurance space."

We believe customer choice is important. And our goal is to continue to work toward customers having options for how they shop for insurance with us. Our plans include both adding products we develop ourselves as well as offering other carrier products in our in-house agency.
In our experience, developing products ourselves works best in our agency business, and we will continue to focus on investments that enable us to continue to grow and succeed with our agents. We're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. In addition to developing our own products, we're offering other carrier products through our in-house agency. That approach is working well for us, and it will remain a part of our strategy for that part of our business. In the end, expanding our product offering is all about having a broad enough product portfolio that agents and customers never have to look elsewhere for their insurance needs.
In 2019, we expanded our product offering with our own business owner's policy and general liability product. This line of business opens up our addressable market with a product that fits with our customer set and creates an opportunity to extend relationships with our customers. Similar to Commercial Auto, our goal is to have a streamlined, intuitive quote flow and competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. We initially limited our appetite to the first 5 categories in this table. They are big enough to matter, allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills and allow for a straightforward streamlined quoting and binding process. We've since added a sixth BMT, Lessors Risk. We've limited our appetite in this category to those commercial rental properties that meet our underwriting criteria in the other 5.
The 6 categories depicted on this screen account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the U.S. with fewer than 20 employees. As we did last year with Lessors Risk, we will continue to expand the categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Today, this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to add real value in small business insurance. We chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and have designed the products, systems and experience to succeed with agents. At the same time, we kept an eye on requirements for the digital channel. And last year, introduced our product in our in-house agency and our online quoting platform for small business owners.
We officially launched our product in May of 2019 and finished the year with 4 states. Last year, all things considered, we finished strong launching 13 new states and introduced an updated product model. And building on the momentum from 2020, we launched 4 additional states through the end of the second quarter and 4 more in July. So we're now in states, representing just over 50% of the commercial multi-peril market. And we expect to roll out another 9 to 10 states this year, and that would result in a state footprint that represents about 67% of the commercial multi-power market.
Feedback we've received from our agents supports our assessment that we have an easy-to-use quoting and underwriting experience and competitive products. We're happy with our momentum, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our progress where we can continue to grow profitably.
I mentioned earlier that we're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier products, and we're having terrific success in growing our direct small commercial business. In September 2018, we introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. With that addition, consumers have a full range of options for how to shop for their small business insurance with us. Going forward, we'll work to optimize the experience in both of these paths. There will be times when the self-directed online path is the best option for a customer and others when calling in for phone support will be the best option. We're happy with this approach as a strategy to meet the demand from consumers who are coming to us directly for their small business insurance needs.
Our small business direct efforts are going well. We've been selling direct to commercial insurance for more than a decade and have made investments in assets and capabilities to meet the growing demand from commercial prospects as well as our own customers. Now pandemic-related shopping patterns do appear to be accelerating the move to online shopping and commercial insurance. And we're well positioned for that move. Our marketing efforts are maturing and generating demand, and we have a good stable of carriers, including our own manufactured BOP and GL products, and we've got an easy-to-use quoting platform. As a result of our investments and an increase in online shopping, growth has accelerated considerably. And with the investments we're making to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate growth within the small business direct channel.
Now the ultimate goal is to extend relationships with our customers and provide more reasons to stay. We know customers who have more products with us retain longer. When looking at our business auto and contractor commercial auto customers with multiple products, we see that those with another Personal Lines product stay with us 5% to 7% longer and those with the BOP product stay about 11% longer. Now we expect policy life expectancy to further extend with more targeted efforts to grow our multiproduct customers. Beyond launching new products like our BOP and GL product, we're also working to make it easier to bundle more with us. Our aspirations include making it easier to purchase multiple products across Commercial Lines and Personal Lines, that new business and to add products as insurance needs grow.
You've heard us describe our aspirations of relationships with our customers lasting for decades or longer. We're making significant progress and expect over time, our commercial relationships will contribute to increasing the number of customers that have chosen to stay with Progressive for a decade or longer. This is all part of our broader vision to become consumers and agents #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we're excited to have considerable underpenetrated addressable market in front of us where we have the people, skills and assets to succeed.

Second question kind of goes towards whether the Personal Auto margin deterioration is -- are there certain pockets where it's worse than others? And what I mean there is, you mentioned in the Q, a couple of things that might make one think so, reduce marketing spend in certain areas, number one. Number two, tightening the underwriting criteria for certain consumer segments. So those 2 things combined make you think that maybe there are certain pockets where it's worse. And I guess, is that true? Or is it more just generally across the board because of what's happening with driving levels going back to normal levels?"

Severity trends up, whether it's injury or used parts and then, of course, our average written premium was down. When we look at media, when we talk about that, we look at our less efficient media. So it's not necessarily based on a certain customer. We look across the board and say, okay, this is our cost per sale, et cetera, and here's what we believe we can get for that. On the other side, we really tried to avoid what we believe could be underpriced risks. And so we developed an underwriting program many, many years ago. Just to ask a few more questions to understand how to appropriately rate each of our customers to the appropriate risk. So a little bit different viewpoint from when we look at media and we look at bringing on risks that we believe are underpriced."

Severity has more than offset that, whether it's injury, attorney reps or components of vehicles, and we believe that can continue. We hope that it abates a little bit. But if you look forward a couple of years, we would hope that they would be more normalized, so we could have that sense of normalcy. Now it's been -- the comparisons are also difficult.

So we're going to do what we can to keep those customers at the target profit margin. The increases will flow into renewal business. And we expect that, that could cause people to shop and we get that. But what we want is -- and our choice of growth is policies in force. We want to continue that growth. We know that we need to have the right rates on The Street. And we've talked about that a lot. Our objective for many, many years, many decades has been to grow as fast as we can at or below 96 and profit comes first in that order. It's one of our core values. So we'll continue to look at that. What -- how we treat these circumstances are things that we've done before. And so not to this extent because we don't -- this is we've never been involved in a pandemic. But we've been in these circumstances before. In fact, if you go back in time, 2012, we had similar circumstances where we found that we needed rates. At the time, actually, John Sauerland, our CFO, was the Personal Lines President, and I was the President of Claims. And we set forth to get the right rate, keeping as many customers as we could. That's really important. And that worked and we were able to grow.
But probably the most important example would be in 2016 when we found ourselves over our 96 goal. And we reduced expenses and a little bit of marketing and really positioned ourselves well for huge growth. And in fact, in the last 5 years, we have grown policies in force on the private passenger auto side, greater than 70%. So how we're looking at today is we believe we did the right thing for customers during the pandemic. We have seen trends steepen at a pretty quick rate. We're going to get the rate we need to get back and be well positioned for that growth that we believe we will come should we head into a hard market."

So I would say that was probably missed on our part slightly just because we hadn't seen that. We did see it going up, but not to the extent or the duration of time. And then the injuries we continue to look at. Attorney rep rate continues to go up. And we're seeing attorneys earlier in the claims sort of across regions and across limit profiles. And there could be a lot of theories on that. It could be that there's more advertising on the attorney parts. It could be that if you're working from home or that you're not working, you're seeing more advertising in order to call that attorney, but we are seeing attorney reps earlier in the claims than we have in the past."

You're talking about growing into other lines of commercial and the capital requirements for some of these other lines embedded in commercial are going to be different than the capital requirements you have for other parts of your personal auto business. And it also, frankly, is applicable to your property business as well. I'm just curious if your 96 targeted combined ratio changes depending on the capital requirements on the type of business that you're in?"

So 96 is slightly different, and it's not for public consumption but slightly different in different areas, depending on that. What we look at also is what we want that ROE to be in any part of the business, and we work towards that. Anytime you have a new business, obviously, you have a big learning experience. When we went into the direct private passenger auto we didn't make money for many years as we learned and grew. And so we expect those -- that to happen as well as we learn new businesses and have our arms around trends. And as we grow, that's one of the reasons why except for the Protective acquisition, which is very different because they know what they're doing on larger fleets. We sort of try to grow into that. So a great example is fleets. For many, many years, we did 0 to 9 power units. We felt we had our arms around that. We were a leader in that, and now we've gone 10 to 40. So we try to learn along the way. Same thing with small business. We're starting with micro businesses, less than 20 employees to make sure that we learn as we grow and expand that addressable market."

It takes time. It doesn't happen overnight, and we've had just a lot of headwinds from that perspective. So I can't tell you the length of time, but we're working aggressively towards de-risking geographically, even if we need to slow down on getting the right rates on The Street and making sure that we continue to segment our property models as deeply as we segmented our private passenger auto and commercial auto."

And in fact, as Tricia was noting, we look at ROE across our business lines. And as you note, required capital. We also look at expected investment returns because the duration of claims is different across lines as well. But we target ROEs across the businesses that are equal to or better than private passenger auto and we back into target combined ratios. So for home, as you would expect, given the higher capital requirements, the combined ratio target is going to be richer. We took 12 points of rate in home last year. We're on track to do it similarly this year. And as Tricia noted, we're taking a lot of actions to get a better geographic footprint that we think reduces the impact of storm losses going forward. If you look back at our recent history, the primary driver of being over 100 has been weather losses. And here, it's been difficult to model, difficult to price. It's -- we're into newer markets, we're learning, and we are taking, we think, aggressive actions to get that combined ratio where we want it, which is well below 100."

And as you see, that's gone up a couple of percentages of increasing on the direct side, which we are not surprised at. And I think especially with the pandemic where there was less availability even though a lot of people weren't weren't necessarily opening small businesses, but there was less availability of agents versus direct just based on shelter in place opportunities that we saw that change. I would expect that more and more customers that have not ever worked with an agent will continue to go online and that, that percentage would increase. But we're going to have to continue to get savvy with our investments on the BusinessQuote Explorer side, but that's, we believe, a really great opportunity.

This construct allows us to focus and make investments that drive value to the organization and all of our constituents. Who we are? Which are our 5 core values? Peter Lewis wrote these back in 1987, and they have served us well over the decades. Specifically during this past 1.5 years, as we've navigated completely foreign waters and have made decisions on behalf of all of our constituents, we have used our core values as a guide. I won't go into all that we did because I've publicly written about much of it, but suffice it to say, we believe all along the way we did the right thing. 
Why we're here. Our purpose statement, which is True to our name, Progressive. We believe this statement is about forward progress, innovation and never resting on our past performance. 
Where we're headed, our vision, which is to become consumer's and agent's #1 choice and insurance needs with us now and as those needs evolve. We know that we must earn their trust every day in order to achieve this vision. 
How we'll get there, our strategy and more specifically, our 4 strategic pillars, which is how we think explicitly about investing to ultimately achieve our vision. I'll briefly give you a high-level overview of how we think about each pillar. 
People and culture, our goal is to ensure our people and culture collectively remain our most powerful source of competitive advantage, including attracting and hiring new talent, retain the people we have and developing everyone so that we can all have long and prosperous careers. We will support our people and culture by ensuring our people can bring their whole selves to work through our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Broad needs. We will meet the broader needs of our customers throughout their lifetimes by being available where, when and how our customers want to interact with us. Helping our customers select the best insurance for their current needs as well as their evolving insurable needs throughout their lifetime. 
Leading brand. We will maintain the leading brand recognized for innovative offerings and supported by experiences that instill confidence with messages that resonate. 
Competitive pricing. We will offer competitive prices by pricing rate to risk through our industry-leading segmentation, balancing efficiency and accuracy in claims and finding ways to continually drive cost down through process changes and technology advances. 
Our agenda will be in 3 sections, and we'll cover the Commercial Auto market and trends in the industry, including our performance relative to the market. We'll do a market overview that will outline our long-term growth plans. And finally, an update on market capabilities and expanding our product offering. 
Before we begin our deep dive Commercial Lines agenda, I do want to acknowledge that we're highly cognizant of the fact that we reported a 100.5 combined ratio for June and are and have been taking steps to ensure profitability as we come out of the pandemic. Commercial Lines is a huge opportunity for Progressive. So I don't want to draw attention away from the very important agenda Karen and Jochen have for you, upcoming by offering prepared comments on results. I expect we'll have the opportunity in Q&A to share steps we've taken and are in the process of undertaking to ensure we achieve our calendar year 96 or better underwriting margin objective.  
Let's kick off the first section by talking about the addressable market. When we began these webcasts many years back, we started with showing the property and casualty addressable market, and we discussed our plans for both Personal Lines and Commercial Lines. Our Commercial Lines offerings have evolved over time, and of course, we recently acquired Protective Insurance. So we thought this was a good time to give you a more detailed update. 
To summarize the entire market, you'll see in the center of the slide that the total property and casualty market is $730 billion. The Progressive share, 5.7% is reflected in both the blue section of the donut and the blue percentages. The gray reflects the industry. 
On the Personal Lines side, we have a 9.6% of the $366 billion market, split between personal auto at 12.9% share and homeowners at 1.7% share. We've had massive growth here, but still plenty of room to grow. 
The Commercial Lines addressable market is $364 billion and includes a wide array of opportunities. The Commercial Auto opportunity alone is a $46 billion market where we hold the #1 position with plenty of room to grow at 12.1% share with a large other commercial addressable market of $318 billion. At this point in time, the market that we believe we can both play and win in is approximately $78 billion. 
If you start near the top of the circle and go clockwise, that entails monoline Commercial Auto, small fleet, transportation network companies, Commercial Auto bundled with GL/BOP, small business with GL/BOP, medium and large fleet with protective and workers' comp with protective. The addressable markets that we aren't currently in include public transportation, larger commercial multi-peril businesses with over 20 employees and products like mortgage guaranty and marine, just to name a few. We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and that we started investing in many years ago to set us up for future growth. 
We've shared these 2x2 charts a few times. As a reminder, the x-axis is the combined ratio on an inverted scale. So you want to be to the right of 100. The y-axis is net written premium growth. So you want to be above the black line showing positive growth. Together, you want to be in the top right-hand shaded area where we're growing market share at or below a 96 combined ratio. The blue dot is Progressive. The black dot is the industry and the gray dots are the others in the top 10 each year since 2015 through 2020. As we reflect in the past 6 years, we've consistently been in that area, growing market share and achieving at least a 96 combined ratio. In fact, on both profitability and growth, we frequently beat the industry in any individual competitor by wide margins. 
I [ think ] to get into the meat of the program, but before I do that, I'll give some background on our speakers. I think many of you have met Karen before. Karen Bailo is our Commercial Lines President. She's been with Progressive for over 30 years with her most recent role as General Manager of Acquisition and Small Business Insurance. Karen has held several other significant leadership positions, including Personal Lines GM, Commercial Lines controller. And most notably, she spent 9 years building our agency distribution organization and positioning Progressive as a preferred supplier in that channel. Karen started her career in customer service as a management trainee and like others on our executive team, she was a claims rep early in her Progressive career. A graduate of the University of South Carolina. Karen earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with a minor in statistics and she went on to earn an MBA from Case Western Reserve University. 
Jochen Schunter began his career at Progressive in 2006 after moving to Cleveland, Ohio from Southern Germany. He's an alumnus of both the University of Dayton, where he earned an MBA and of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, where he earned Bachelors and Masters degree in the Arts. After doing rounds in both the accounting and analyst rotational programs at Progressive, Jochen joined Commercial Lines in 2008. He started out in various pricing and control functions and then moved into product management. First, he managed several states, including California and our market entry into Hawaii and then took on bigger responsibilities as the leader of our truck product. During his tenure, he significantly contributed to increasing our market share by rolling out numerous product enhancements and also improving segmentation. Now as Commercial Lines controller, Jochen leads the organization responsible for ensuring we run a profitable business. This includes strategy and performance monitoring, risk analysis, data and analytics, rate setting, compliance and recovery as well as finance and accounting. 
I'll now hand it over to Karen to outline our Commercial Lines trends."

While our June results include Protective based on our closing date of June 1 for the purposes of this presentation, unless otherwise stated, the numbers exclude Protective. I'd like to begin with a look at our performance relative to the industry. 
This is a 20-year time series of Progressive Commercial Auto net written premium growth rate versus the rest of the industry. During this time period, our results have really diverged from the industry. There are a couple of observations around growth that I'd like to highlight. 
First, Commercial Auto has some cyclicality to it and tends to move with the larger economy. And second, when the market grows, Progressive has historically grown at a faster pace. In fact, since 2016, we've doubled the business and gained almost 4 points of market share, and that equates to more than 20% compounded growth rate and achieving more than 12% market share. 
The more significant divergence from the market has been an underwriting profit. We've outperformed the industry by 8 to 10 and as much as 20 points over those 20 years. Our objective is to grow as fast as we can at target combined ratios. And we've had a track record of success and outperformed the industry on both growth and profit over those 20 years. 
There's a number of contributing factors, but perhaps most important has been the intense focus on Commercial Auto as a core line of business for the company. We've shared this information in the past and wanted to provide a brief refresher on how we approach our auto business. We segment our business into what we refer to as business market targets. And we introduced these business market targets for Commercial Auto in 2014. 
Since introduced, BMTs are now operationalized across virtually every aspect of our business. That's important because we see meaningful and actionable differences between these BMTs. For example, the demand function is different by BMT and how that demand function responds to changes in different economic conditions is different. We also see that losses present differently and how they develop, attorney representation rates and litigation outcomes differ by BMT. Certainly, frequency and severity trends and other factors change at different rates and at different times by BMT. All of which are critical inputs to determining rate level. This granular focus allows us to develop insights faster, be more responsive with strategies and tactics to profitably grab market share. 
I want to talk about what we're observing in shopping, loss trends and how we're positioned for continued success. We have the benefit of over 10 billion miles of driving data with our telematics data. This chart shows patterns in driving miles, highway congestion and highway speeding pre and post pandemic. You can see that as stay-at-home orders were issued, there was a significant decrease in miles driven and congestion on the highway. At the same time, there was an increase in highway speeding. Now while the impact from COVID on small businesses was severe, when we look at our business class level data, it's also clear that different businesses were affected differently. For example, in the truck space, fully 1/3 of our Smart Haul customers saw their mileage increase, while about 8% were shut down completely. Landscapers and most construction trades were still working and other service businesses were not. 
Looking at more recent trends. While we see mileage and congestion back to pre-COVID levels, speeding events haven't dropped back to where they were. This raises the question around whether COVID brought a permanent change to truckers driving habits and is something we'll keep a close eye on in the months to come. 
In addition to our own data, we look to other macroeconomic trends to develop a deeper understanding of shopping and small business trends, especially during challenging economic conditions. This chart shows our insurance shopping trends, in this case, agency quote growth for businesses that tie to goods and services sectors indexed to 2019. Progressive quote data is in the solid line, and consumer spend data is in the dotted line. Our experience tracks closely to the rate of consumer spending on goods and services. So this is data we have and we'll continue to monitor. 
The macroeconomic data shows spending on goods recovered more quickly, while the services sector has lagged and has been more depressed relative to good sectors. Some of that is because services sectors were more affected by stay-at-home orders and good spending has been supported by federal government stimulus. That intuitively makes sense, and we see that in our underlying data. Businesses that were considered more essential, plumbing or sanitation services or those that tie to the transportation of goods like agriculture hauling or livestock hauling, responded differently versus those that are tied to services industries like airport shuttles, food trucks and entertainers. The positive news is that as the service businesses reopen, we're seeing a recovery in spending towards 2019 levels. This increase in spending on services should drive a rebound in insurance shopping for businesses related to that sector. Again, food trucks, restaurant delivery, airport shuttles, just to name a few. 
In summary, different businesses have been affected differently. And this is important in terms of how we think about trends, the implications for frequency and severity and ultimately rate level going forward. 
In our last update in 2019, we shared a historical perspective that provides a good illustration of how we will approach today's environment. Back in 2016, we saw a marked increase in frequency between May and November. At the same time, some prior year reserve development was contributing to an already positive severity trend. We responded quickly to address those trends, raising rates by more than 10% and made a series of underwriting changes in about 3 months, and we've continued with a series of changes and adjustments since. 
Fast forward to recent trends, you can clearly see the impact of COVID on frequency. We saw a sharp decline in frequency as stay-at-home orders went into effect. And as I shared earlier, driving miles from our usage-based insurance data shows driving miles and congestion levels are back to prepandemic levels. And the services sectors are also rebounding. Given all of those conditions, we're seeing loss frequency rising relative to COVID lows when frequency fell dramatically. And at the same time, we continue to see a steady increase in severity trends that we've been accounting for in our rate level indications. 
Given the variation in how businesses were affected by the pandemic, some slowing down and others seeing an increase in business, we have been and plan to continue to be cautious in our actions. We haven't lowered rates, and we've been conservative in our pricing and underwriting decisions. The trends we're observing now are lining up with what's forecasted in our rate level indications. We have planned for frequency recovery and a continued steep severity trend and have kept pace with net trends with a combined rate increase of 29% from the beginning of 2016 through the first half of this year. 
The additional segmentation we've built into the product over the last 5 years has proven effective and driven better than industry underwriting results and growth. And I would suggest having a granular approach to the business and reacting decisively to what we see, while much of the market is slower to react has been an important part of maintaining strong underwriting margins and growing the business over the years. So we continue to advance our product segmentation and underwriting capabilities, and we plan to continue to respond appropriately to loss trends going forward. 
I'd like to shift to a discussion on expenses and efficiency. Now we know from experience that companies that can achieve a lower cost structure, gain share at a greater rate than the overall industry. We've seen that in the Personal Lines market and believe it matters in the Commercial Lines market as well. The correlation of efficiency aiding and growth isn't lost on us, and we're well positioned on this chart. 
Now 2020 results show that we're nearly 11 points lower than the industry average in LAE and expense ratio. In a very price-sensitive industry, that 11-point advantage is significant. But there's a balance. We don't necessarily want to be the lowest because we believe and also investing in what matters. Quality outcomes for customers that earn loyalty and investments that foster great work environments for our employees. 
To that end, I'd like to highlight where we're making investments to improve on both those fronts. This is a view of our expense ratio track record over a 10-year time period. And over that time period, we've seen a 7 to 8-point expense advantage compared to the industry. That advantage was 6 points in 2020 due in part because COVID credits flowed through expenses rather than premium, resulting in a slight elevated expense ratio. While we've had an expense advantage over this time period, we're prioritizing initiatives to extend our leadership position. There are a number of levers that drive expense ratio advantages. And while we don't have enough time for a comprehensive review of all the efforts underway, I wanted to share with you 2 examples that demonstrate active cost management efforts to drive expense reductions and improve experiences at the same time. These both highlight our focus in managing expenses related to our growth and improving our operational efficiency. 
We maintain a disciplined focus on managing overhead and growth in headcount as we grow the business. This chart is designed to represent a few things. The solid blue line represents overall net earned premium growth. The solid orange line represents employee costs and real estate costs are represented in the solid black line. You can see that while employee costs and real estate costs have gone up, they've grown at a lower rate relative to net earned premium. And there are a couple of reasons for that. One is being disciplined and judicious in decisions to increase staff. We've added the dotted lines here to represent volume-driven and nonvolume-driven employee growth. And while we've grown our volume-driven counts in line with our net earned premium pace, we've been very targeted in adding nonvolume-driven resources, and our nonvolume-driven employee count has grown at a much lower rate. This discipline has resulted in growing our total employee cost, the orange line, less the net earned premium growth.  
The second is related to real estate. Like Personal Lines, prior to the pandemic, our customer and agent services organization enabled real estate expense savings by implementing a home-based consultant model. This model has a number of benefits. It provides broader access to talent and improved our ability to increase staff to support our growing business, especially last year, and it's also provided flexibility that employees value. In addition, this model allows us to grow our business without a commensurate growth in space. In 2019, almost 40% of our Commercial Lines agents and customer services consultants were working from home. Now we're still working through our plans as we transition back to the office post pandemic. We expect the portion of our customer and agent services consultants that work from home to grow materially as people make the decision to remain working from home going forward. This will support our ability to grow without significantly growing our real estate footprint. 
The second example of our cost management efforts highlights investments in systems and technology to deliver the products and services our agents and customers value while focusing on increasing operational efficiency. We've been investing significantly in systems to support our core auto business and in expanding our business with our BOP product and direct small business capabilities. Despite significant investments in technology and systems, we've been able to maintain our expense advantage. And we acknowledge and expected this relatively short-term increase in technology costs to lower our costs in the long run with gains in efficiency and new lines of business. 
Now improving efficiency to push our expense advantage is a key objective. Two examples of progress are shown here. We've shared in previous annual report commentary that we're transitioning to a new policy administration system. And this new system is a significant driver of our technology expenses and rolling out the new system is a big part of our ability to drive more efficiency. 
The new system introduces more modern functionality that enables faster delivery of our products and enhancements and the ability to improve customer experiences and self-service capabilities. The initial launch of this new system in [ estate ] brings consumer online buying capabilities.  
The chart on the left shows the total lift in direct online sales yield with our new system. Now completely isolating the effects of the online buy capabilities is difficult. But we're seeing an 80% improvement in online sales yield after introducing this new system. And that would translate to more than a 20% increase in direct auto sales. Now while direct is still a relatively small portion of our business. We expect this added functionality to bring long-term economic benefit to us in terms of improved sales yield and lower acquisition costs for that part of our business. And that's very important as this business grows. 
A second way we're gaining efficiency is via process automation. On the right is a representation of improvements and we've already made reducing the manual work associated with millions of documents we receive every year via fax, e-mail or paper mail. Until recently, each document had to be manually reviewed and categorized for action, either to be attached to a policy and sent directly to storage or put in queue for additional processing. Over half of these documents are in that first group. They don't require any action beyond archival. We have a project underway to automate that workflow by the end of the year using optical character recognition technology, to review those documents automatically and attach them to a policy and send them to storage without human intervention. And this frees up resources to focus on other more value-added work. These are just 2 examples to illustrate how we will focus future investments. 
Now while we're pleased with our early progress, we're just getting started, and we have a robust road map ahead of us that will target more efficiency improvements and self-service capabilities designed to meet customer and agent's expectations. Investments in product, experiences and more efficient workflows combined should enable us to reduce the drivers of costs to service our customers. We anticipate that by lowering our costs, we will be able to further extend our expense advantage and position us well for any market conditions. 
Now moving on to the other part of our expense advantage. We believe our claims organization provides us with a significant competitive advantage on Commercial Auto vis-a-vis our competition. We've doubled the core auto business while maintaining very competitive loss adjustment expense ratios and good quality. Our claims advantage comes from a surgical focus on claims accuracy and efficiency. And back in 2019, we shared how our claims organization leverages the scale of our broader Personal Lines claims organization with a focus on specialization for high-impact and complex claims. We continue to push Commercial Lines specialization as we grow our business. And we also see significant potential in leveraging technology and analytics to increase productivity and claims handling segmentation along with improving accuracy. 
I wanted to share a brief example to illustrate how we're leveraging data, data science and advanced analytics to monitor and react to claims activity and exposure changes. The image on this slide represents a homegrown tool developed to inform leaders of claims that need review. The tool is powered by a file intervention program that uses analysis and data science to populate the tool and is designed to improve a leader's focus on at-risk files. This helps improve claims accuracy through better coaching and supports timely claim handling efforts. We know handling delays can result in unfavorable outcomes. And the alerts are prioritized and trigger on the best date for the leader to intervene for the most favorable results. 
In this example, you see a code [ FS13 ] with the description potential for delayed total loss resolution. In this example, an alert triggered on March 19 with a message indicating a potential delay in resolving a total loss settlement. The leader intervenes by providing guidance to the claim rep on the open activity on the file. And since the leader intervened, the trigger is programmed to return 2 days later to make sure the claim rep is following up on the guidance provided. The next alert triggers on March 21. The leader reviews the file and sees that the claim rep followed up on the direction provided, so no additional intervention is needed at this point in time. The leader indicates no to the intervention question in the lower left. And once no intervention is selected, an alert is programmed to return 8 days later if the total loss is still not resolved. In this case, the total loss resolved on March 25, and so the alert didn't return for the third time. This is a powerful tool that helps our claims teams efficiently run the business of claims and contribute to more timely and accurate claims handling. 
A final point on our performance relative to the industry is related to reserving where our philosophy is to be as accurate as possible with minimal variation. This chart shows our Commercial Auto reserve development versus the industry, and we have a much tighter variance. And we see 2 primary reasons for this. One contributing factor is the claims organization we just talked about. Leveraging technology and advanced analytics to increase productivity and get the right claims to the right resource more quickly leads to more timely and accurate claims handling and better outcomes. 
The other contributing factor is the highly segmented approach we take to loss reserving for Commercial Auto as we do with our other products. We've operationalized that BMT structure, in addition to the usual loss cost cuts, and it allows us to see pattern changes sooner and react appropriately. Having more consistent and predictable loss cost estimates through accurate reserving lets us understand our true ultimate cost faster and be more responsive with pricing and product refinements. 
So that's a little background on what we've been seeing in our Commercial Auto results recently and why we've been able to produce some different outcomes relative to the industry. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Jochen Schunter, who will share a little about our plans for extending our leadership in Commercial Auto, including how and where Protective Insurance fits into those plans."

I'd like to spend some time talking about our track record of extending our Commercial Auto leadership position and investments that we continue to make. 
Let me start by talking a little bit about our 2 telematics programs that we have in market today, Smart Haul and Snapshot ProView. We're proud to say that we have recently surpassed $500 million of Commercial Auto premium in force from these telematics-based programs and that we've analyzed over 10 billion miles of data. Smart Haul is our truck-focused telematics program that leverages the data from federally mandated electronic logging devices or ELD for short. [indiscernible] federal mandate, most over-the-road truckers need an ELD to manage their hours of service. Smart Haul uses driving data from a trucker's existing ELD in exchange for a discount on the insurance of up to 18%. And while conversion is nearly double our normal truck conversion, we continue to see a sizable loss ratio advantage for this book even after applying those steep discounts, which average about $1,500 per policy. It's clear. This is good business and it's all incremental and verifiable segmentation that we're able to apply at point of sale.
To demonstrate how powerful this segmentation has proven to be, I'd like to draw your attention to the chart on the left. Telematics is the most predictive variable in our for-hire transportation segment. The depicted bar includes the power of new variables, enabled by telematics in addition to variables that can be derived from telematics, such as territory or zone. As you can see, telematics is, by far, our most predictive rating variable. And we have plans to further evolve the model by adding even more predictiveness to it. Our continued research of driving data is allowing us to constantly evolve and improve the model.
Switching over to our other telematics program, Snapshot ProView. We have a program that provides discounts and complementary fleet management features to our non-ELD customers. While this program is much younger, we already see the segmentation power of telematics, especially in segments where driving panels vary significantly from risk to risk.
The chart on the slide shows the average drive time for select business classes and their variance around that average. Let's pick the restaurant business class as an example. We have [ ensured that ] use their vehicle close to 5 hours a day, likely to deliver food. At the same time, we have restaurants that used the vehicle less than 1 hour a day. You can imagine last cars may look very different for those 2 use cases. That's just 1 example, how telematics data can help us create new segmentation as we create new insights from the 10 billion miles of collected data.
Next, I'd like to highlight some of the most significant milestones we've been able to achieve in commercial auto over the years that we're especially proud of. First, in 2008, we became the largest write-off truck insurance in the United States. In 2015, we became the #1 writer of Commercial Auto overall. In 2019, we became the #1 writer of preferred truck in the nonfleet space. I'll talk more about that in a minute. And lastly, this year, we passed $6 billion in net written premium, making us more than 2x the size of our next closest competitor based on trailing 12-month statutory data.
As mentioned on the prior slide, we've made big strides in growing our preferred truck book, enabling us to become the #1 write-off nonfleet preferred truck in 2019. We define preferred truck as motor carriers that have a track record of being financially responsible with 3 or more yields in business and a strong safety record. Based on our analysis, we grew our estimated share of nonfleet preferred truck from 5.9% in January of 2016 to 15.4% in May of 2021. On a direct written premium basis, that reflects an annual growth rate of 29.5% over that same 5-year time period. 
We did so by launching product enhancements that improved our competitiveness while hitting our annual calendar year profit targets each of those yields. Those investments have helped us improve consideration amongst the most preferred truckers shopping for insurance. In fact, of all the nonfleet preferred motor carriers that require a federal filing that switched insurance carriers in 2021 without a lapse in coverage, we got quoted on 48.2% of them. That number is up from 35.3% in Q1 of 2016. With this success, we continue to pursue a robust road map to enhance our product and coverage offerings along with improved segmentation, allowing us to offer even lower rates for the best risk.
Another exciting opportunity to grow our business across all BMTs is targeted at businesses with 10 to 40 vehicles. The small fleet market is about a $7 billion market where we have low penetration and only began increasing our focus on and investing in over the last couple of years. As we increased our focus, we saw opportunities to improve our pricing and add fleet-specific segmentation to provide more competitive rates to the best fleet risks. In addition, we expanded our underwriting team to support new underwriting capabilities, ensure appropriate pricing and accelerate the underwriting process. Today, we have the segmentation, assets and capabilities to compete effectively in this attractive market.
As you can see on the left chart, we've been able to more than triple our fleet book over the last 5 years with a meaningful acceleration in the last year. The right funnel chart shows the impact of improvements we've been able to elevate just in the last year driving that growth. While we've been able to increase growth by 19% in the trailing 12 months, we've been able to increase bindable quotes by 85% and ultimately, sales by 92%.
Let me cover some of the specific improvements that have allowed us to achieve those results. First, we brought and continue to bring automation and technology to the quoting process, helping us to increase efficiency. Specifically, we've automated the review of the supplemental application intake of this data into our database, underwriting review processes and related agent follow-up. We've also been able to improve the quote turn around time by simplifying the quote process and leveraging our distribution organization to educate agents, which in turn is driving agent engagement, more completed quotes and increased conversion.
With our continued investments, we believe we're well positioned to continue our growth in the small fleet space. Talking about investments in small fleet, that's a great transition to highlight our plans to move even further upstream in the fleet market. That's where our recent acquisition of Protective Insurance fits in.
Before we get to talking about how Protective will help us grow fleets, let's spend a few minutes and talk about Protective, the products Protective offers and customers they serve. Let's start with some background. Protective Insurance is located in Carmel, Indiana, employing about 500 people. The company has nearly 100 years of experience of providing innovative insurance solutions primarily for the fleet trucking operations. Protective operates several statutory insurance companies, which are collectively licensed in all 50 states. While Protective will benefit from Progressive's strong balance sheet and financial strength, Progressive will benefit from many of Protective's unique capabilities, allowing it to successfully serve the fleet market. Let's talk about some of those capabilities and the Protective product suite.
Protective sales, many of the lines we're very familiar with including Commercial Auto physical damage, Commercial Auto liability, nontrucking liability, cargo and general liability. In addition, and very critical to fleets coverage needs, Protective offers workers' comp and occupational accident. Two coverages that are very additive to Progressive's offering. In fact, workers' comp reflects the largest statutory commercial coverage in terms of premium, even bigger than commercial auto. As mentioned on the prior slide, this is done through a variety of statutory entities and distribution channels.
Next, let's cover what customers Protective sales. While we just talked about Progressive's #1 position in truck overall, it's important to note that we've achieved that position primarily by dominating the less than 10 vehicle space. Only recently have we begun investing into our fleet product, becoming competitive for fleets of up to 40 total vehicles, inclusive of trailers. We're early in that journey. And while we've hit some major milestones and seen some encouraging growth, we realized that there are needed capabilities we would have to build to effectively compete for medium and large fleets. Protective delivers those capabilities, allowing us to move upstream. Those include sophisticated risk retention mechanisms, allowing fleets to participate in the risk and indemnity; safety and loss control programs, along with underwriting expertise; and lastly, rating by mileage and revenue.
Independent contractors in the FedEx Affinity program are amongst many of Protective's other customers engaged in the rapidly growing last mile delivery space. A sector, we expect to continue to expand over the coming years.
Switching to profitability. Protective has had a long track record of generating excellent results, meeting their respective profit targets over decades. Similarly to Progressive, in doing so, they were able to outperform the Commercial Auto industry consistently. While the last few years have been challenged from a profitability perspective, we strongly believe that the right actions have been taken to return to those industry-leading combined ratios. Specifically, Protective has refocused on its core business, which is transportation insurance. In addition, significant rate was taken to account for the industry's steep severity trends. We believe this focus on core products and rate take are already proving to be successful with the last few quarters showing constant improvement of underwriting results.
In addition, Protective has reinsurance in place to protect from significant adverse development from prior accident yields. Those reinsurance treaties ensure that retained severities and tails are consistent with Progressive's established risk appetite.
Finally, I'd like to talk about how Protective is additive to Progressive's product offering and allows us to expand our addressable market. Clearly, while we're both heavily focused on the Commercial Auto line, we do so with minimal overlap. Progressive is the market leader in the small transportation space, while Protective is a leader in the medium and large transportation fleet space. Together, we're able to serve that market in its entirety and with Protective's workers' comp capabilities, we're able to establish a foothold into that critical coverage. A coverage that is considered an anchor product in the small, medium and large fleet space. We look forward to further complementing each other's product offering, enabling both entities to grow market share collectively.
Lastly, while we are still early in this acquisition, we look forward to what we call preserve and learn for the remainder of the year before focusing on further integrating our commercial offerings under the Progressive Commercial Lines umbrella. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight that we intend to maintain the Carmel, Indiana operation. This acquisition has always been about growing addressable markets and therefore, revenue collectively beyond what each of us would be able to achieve individually.
With that, I'd like to go back to a slide Tricia shared earlier. This slide shows our addressable market, which has grown to $78 billion with this acquisition, which reflects an increase of more than 25%.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Karen, who will cover our investments in the small business insurance space."

We believe customer choice is important. And our goal is to continue to work toward customers having options for how they shop for insurance with us. Our plans include both adding products we develop ourselves as well as offering other carrier products in our in-house agency.
In our experience, developing products ourselves works best in our agency business, and we will continue to focus on investments that enable us to continue to grow and succeed with our agents. We're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. In addition to developing our own products, we're offering other carrier products through our in-house agency. That approach is working well for us, and it will remain a part of our strategy for that part of our business. In the end, expanding our product offering is all about having a broad enough product portfolio that agents and customers never have to look elsewhere for their insurance needs.
In 2019, we expanded our product offering with our own business owner's policy and general liability product. This line of business opens up our addressable market with a product that fits with our customer set and creates an opportunity to extend relationships with our customers. Similar to Commercial Auto, our goal is to have a streamlined, intuitive quote flow and competitive pricing derived from expense discipline and price segmentation. We initially limited our appetite to the first 5 categories in this table. They are big enough to matter, allow us to develop pricing and segmentation skills and allow for a straightforward streamlined quoting and binding process. We've since added a sixth BMT, Lessors Risk. We've limited our appetite in this category to those commercial rental properties that meet our underwriting criteria in the other 5.
The 6 categories depicted on this screen account for about half of the 31 million small businesses in the U.S. with fewer than 20 employees. As we did last year with Lessors Risk, we will continue to expand the categories over time as we gain experience and identify additional opportunities to automate the quoting and underwriting flow. Today, this business is in the agency channel and agents continue to add real value in small business insurance. We chose to deploy our BOP product in the agency channel first and have designed the products, systems and experience to succeed with agents. At the same time, we kept an eye on requirements for the digital channel. And last year, introduced our product in our in-house agency and our online quoting platform for small business owners.
We officially launched our product in May of 2019 and finished the year with 4 states. Last year, all things considered, we finished strong launching 13 new states and introduced an updated product model. And building on the momentum from 2020, we launched 4 additional states through the end of the second quarter and 4 more in July. So we're now in states, representing just over 50% of the  Commercial Multi Peril market. And we expect to roll out another 9 to 10 states this year, and that would result in a state footprint that represents about 67% of the  Commercial Multi Peril market.
Feedback we've received from our agents supports our assessment that we have an easy-to-use quoting and underwriting experience and competitive products. We're happy with our momentum, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our progress where we can continue to grow profitably.
I mentioned earlier that we're pursuing a different strategy for consumers that come to us directly. We built an in-house agency to sell other carrier products, and we're having terrific success in growing our direct small commercial business. In September 2018, we introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, which is our online quoting platform for small business owners. With that addition, consumers have a full range of options for how to shop for their small business insurance with us. Going forward, we'll work to optimize the experience in both of these paths. There will be times when the self-directed online path is the best option for a customer and others when calling in for phone support will be the best option. We're happy with this approach as a strategy to meet the demand from consumers who are coming to us directly for their small business insurance needs.
Our small business direct efforts are going well. We've been selling direct to commercial insurance for more than a decade and have made investments in assets and capabilities to meet the growing demand from commercial prospects as well as our own customers. Now pandemic-related shopping patterns do appear to be accelerating the move to online shopping and commercial insurance. And we're well positioned for that move. Our marketing efforts are maturing and generating demand, and we have a good stable of carriers, including our own manufactured BOP and GL products, and we've got an easy-to-use quoting platform. As a result of our investments and an increase in online shopping, growth has accelerated considerably. And with the investments we're making to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence in our ability to continue to accelerate growth within the small business direct channel.
Now the ultimate goal is to extend relationships with our customers and provide more reasons to stay. We know customers who have more products with us retain longer. When looking at our business auto and contractor commercial auto customers with multiple products, we see that those with another Personal Lines product stay with us 5% to 7% longer and those with the BOP product stay about 11% longer. Now we expect policy life expectancy to further extend with more targeted efforts to grow our multiproduct customers. Beyond launching new products like our BOP and GL product, we're also working to make it easier to bundle more with us. Our aspirations include making it easier to purchase multiple products across Commercial Lines and Personal Lines, that new business and to add products as insurance needs grow.
You've heard us describe our aspirations of relationships with our customers lasting for decades or longer. We're making significant progress and expect over time, our commercial relationships will contribute to increasing the number of customers that have chosen to stay with Progressive for a decade or longer. This is all part of our broader vision to become consumers' and agents' #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance. And we're excited to have considerable underpenetrated addressable market in front of us where we have the people, skills and assets to succeed.
Thanks for your time today. And now we'll move on to the Q&A portion of our session."

Higher-level question on that, I guess, the regulatory question is the nuts and bolts of the question is, is it tougher to push for rates today than a normal environment. And what I mean by that is, I think there's a pretty clear contrast today, unlike in other periods where the experience period you used to do your rate filings is pretty profitable unlike the projection period where there's clearly some deterioration. And not only deterioration, but questions on how long that deterioration might last, is the severity or short-lived, is the frequency lived as well?

And again, we'll watch it closely and just like we did during the pandemic. After we gave the over $1 billion back on the private passenger auto side for the credits, we looked across because we knew that consumers were struggling and there were layoffs, et cetera. We looked across states and channels and products and took rates down a little bit. And so that's really the conversation we're having with regulators. We're going to always try to do the right thing to grow as fast as we can. But we have to make our target profit margins. And what we're seeing now is some pretty steep severity trends. And again, we'll watch for that. We'll watch for any macroeconomic inflationary trends and the like to understand what our future rate should be."

So it's not necessarily based on a certain customer. We look across the board and say, okay, this is our cost per sale, et cetera, and here's what we believe we can get for that. On the other side, we really tried to avoid what we believe could be underpriced risks. And so we developed an underwriting program many, many years ago.

We know that we need to have the right rates on The Street. And we've talked about that a lot. Our objective for many, many years, many decades has been to grow as fast as we can at or below 96 and profit comes first in that order. 
It's one of our core values. So we'll continue to look at that. What -- how we treat these circumstances are things that we've done before. And so not to this extent because we don't -- this is we've never been involved in a pandemic. But we've been in these circumstances before. In fact, if you go back in time, 2012, we had similar circumstances where we found that we needed rates. At the time, actually, John Sauerland, our CFO, was the Personal Lines President, and I was the President of Claims. And we set forth to get the right rate, keeping as many customers as we could. That's really important. And that worked and we were able to grow.
But probably the most important example would be in 2016 when we found ourselves over our 96 goal. And we reduced expenses and a little bit of marketing and really positioned ourselves well for huge growth. And in fact, in the last 5 years, we have grown policies in force on the private passenger auto side, greater than 70%. So how we're looking at today is we believe we did the right thing for customers during the pandemic. We have seen trends steepen at a pretty quick rate.

What we probably underpredicted on severity was the used car valuations and not just the magnitude, but the length of time, the duration. And we did look at that for future trends, not to the extent of what we're seeing. And again, that's something that's been very different during the pandemic in terms of supply and demand and what is happening with new cars and the lack of available chips, et cetera. So I would say that was probably missed on our part slightly just because we hadn't seen that. We did see it going up, but not to the extent or the duration of time. And then the injuries we continue to look at. Attorney rep rate continues to go up. And we're seeing attorneys earlier in the claims sort of across regions and across limit profiles. And there could be a lot of theories on that. It could be that there's more advertising on the attorney parts. It could be that if you're working from home or that you're not working, you're seeing more advertising in order to call that attorney, but we are seeing attorney reps earlier in the claims than we have in the past."

So that's a little bit different. On the property side, we had 25 points of cat exposure. And so I think we are looking at a little bit different geographic expansion to make sure that we, in a sense, derisk a little bit of that book. And then in addition, on the property side, we want to be able to continue to get rate as we have since last year and have a more segmented product.

And so we expect those -- that to happen as well as we learn new businesses and have our arms around trends. 
And as we grow, that's one of the reasons why except for the Protective acquisition, which is very different because they know what they're doing on larger fleets. We sort of try to grow into that. So a great example is fleets. For many, many years, we did 0 to 9 power units. We felt we had our arms around that. We were a leader in that, and now we've gone 10 to 40.

We also look at expected investment returns because the duration of claims is different across lines as well. But we target ROEs across the businesses that are equal to or better than private passenger auto and we back into target combined ratios. So for home, as you would expect, given the higher capital requirements, the combined ratio target is going to be richer. We took 12 points of rate in home last year. We're on track to do it similarly this year. And as Tricia noted, we're taking a lot of actions to get a better geographic footprint that we think reduces the impact of storm losses going forward. If you look back at our recent history, the primary driver of being over 100 has been weather losses. And here, it's been difficult to model, difficult to price. It's -- we're into newer markets, we're learning, and we are taking, we think, aggressive actions to get that combined ratio where we want it, which is well below 100."

But we're going to have to continue to get savvy with our investments on the BusinessQuote Explorer side, but that's, we believe, a really great opportunity. We love the fact that we have a big agent presence, but there will be customers that want to go through direct and we'll be there for them as part of our strategic pillar of broad coverage."

We appreciate you joining us.During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers return to normal driving habits as the count",595,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's third quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us.
During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers return to normal driving habits as the country opens in the pandemic, and as supply constrained contributed to an unprecedented increase in vehicle valuation. In the third quarter, those challenges continued with the added effect of the most expensive storm in Progressive's history, Hurricane Ida. The result of these challenges is our first quarter with an above 100 CR in 20 years. In true Progressive fashion, we are facing these challenges head on to do what's needed to meet our publicly stated goal of a 96 combined ratio on an annual basis. 
As part of our efforts to ensure we meet our 96 targets, we are taking rate increases across our product lines. While objections and regulators' prudency are part of the revision process, the pressures on the insurance pricing are real. The entire industry has been buffeted by the headwinds of higher severity, post-pandemic increased frequency and weather-related catastrophes. Regulators take their mandate of adequate grades seriously. And as such, we've been able to work with regulators to increase rates to meet the rising costs.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have placed in market increases in aggregate of 5 points in personal auto, 3 points in commercial lines and 8 points in properties. In Personal Auto, during the third quarter, rate increases were effective in 20 states, which had an average increase of about 6%. So we're taking the changes in the environment seriously and reacting decisively. We have more revisions and process across our suite of products as we work to ensure the rest of 2021 and 2022 meet our calendar year objectives.
Underwriting is another lever that we are using to address profitability. We continue to use this lever in Commercial and Personal Lines to ensure we write exposures accurately and that meet our underwriting targets. In Personal Auto, our 8.7 model, which is now in states representing about 40% of our premium further advances the science of underwriting. In homeowners, where profitability has been under pressure for several quarters, we are taking additional steps to hasten our progress to meet our profit objectives. In states with high cat exposure, we have changed our underwriting roles to reduce our exposure, including targeted nonrenewals. While nonrenewals are not our preferred path, there are times where we need to use nontraditional methods to meet our targets.
While we take steps on the profitability side of the business, we continue to see strong growth. Personal Lines written premiums grew 7%, while Commercial Lines and homeowners both saw double-digit year-over-year written premium growth in the third quarter. Personal Lines and homeowners recorded PIF growth of 8% and 13% in the quarter, respectively. Commercial Auto continues to capitalize on the macroeconomic environment with its third straight quarter of double-digit PIP growth, largely due to growth in the 4 higher trucking segment. Though our underwriting actions often have the unfortunate side effect of reducing growth, our product managers continue to scour the competitive landscape to find profitable growth opportunities.
Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank Mike Sieger, our Claims President; and Jeff Cerny, our Chief Marketing Officer, for their contributions to Progressive and to offer my congratulations on their planned retirements. While I'm confident that their replacements are up to the task, Mike and Jeff's presence will be greatly missed. Thank you, and I'm ready to take the first question."

And we watch it closely, especially because we have so much data from our usage-based insurance, our Snapshot. And there's a couple in trends that I'd like to share. And we're going to watch these closely again. There's been so many dynamic shifts since the pandemic that we really do have to watch and then react the data. So if you look at vehicle miles traveled, they haven't really changed since the last call. They're still down about 6% to 8% from our 2017 and 2019 baseline. The bigger news that we've watched is frequency has picked up. And we've noticed that in each quarter, specifically in PD and collision. So let me give you a little bit of color on the things we watch for.
So during Quarter 1, collision frequency was down about 10 points more than vehicle miles traveled. In Quarter 2, that narrowed to 7 points. And in Quarter 3, that narrowed further to 3 points. So we look at day parts. During Quarter 3, that narrowing was kind of across the whole day. During Quarter 3, we saw that frequency narrow more during the morning rush hours. So think of 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. While we see some evidence that there's congestion as well, it's a little bit surprising to us because people haven't fully returned to the office. We read the headlines in most companies because of the Delta variant have pushed off a full return to the office until January. So could it be that there going back to school. So we're taking our children to school. So there's other variables that we're watching really closely.
I think what will be interesting is to see what happens first quarter 2022 when many companies have stated they're going to return to work. And of course, what will that mean? It certainly won't mean full return for every single person. I think there's going to be a lot of flexibility built in based on the pandemic. So we think that will be an interesting data point. We also have observed frequency up sharply in the overnight hours. So think of like 1:00 am to 6:00 a.m., both weekends and weekdays. That correlated with the March reopening. And that frequency is above pre-COVID levels by about 10% to 20%. Again, a smaller amount of people driving. So we're watching VMTs closely by daypart in each state, et cetera, and we'll be very interested to see how frequency continues to close the gap on vehicle miles traveled or not, but we're going to watch that closely. So we were able to get a lot of interesting information from our telematics data, and we're going to continue to watch that. Does that help, Mike?"

I think it's really hard to rely on historical metrics when we're looking at the data. So when you look at case IBNR or paid to incurred, whether you compare it to companies or even our own historical data, it's really hard without having the underlying data. So we have changes to our closure rate, drop and then rebound in frequency, increase in severity. All those ratios change when you look at that. What I would say about Progressive is that we feel very good about where we're at, again, with adequate, with minimal variation. We're about 0.5 point unfavorable for the year, and the majority of that can be attributed to FortaPiP. So we don't believe there's conservative, and we have not changed our model."

And then, of course, when and decreased rates by another 3%, which equated to another $800 million on top of the $1 billion we gave back. So what I was referring to was now we're in a much different place and severity trends are up 10 points, and we need rates. And we want to make sure, in the end, I mean, we believe that regulators are rational. They want to make sure that we're open and available and have competitive rates because that's good for all of our consumers. And so what I was referring to there is when things change swiftly, it's got to go both sides and in many of the states that we work with.

And so different states look at it differently. So as you look at say like a California, their Department of Insurance requires us to look backwards to fill up a template. So while California was a little bit behind in frequency, it has picked up and is actually outpacing countrywide at this point. And so when you fill up those templates, those rate indications are going to be distorted based on the data from last year. What we believe will happen is it's not reflective of the claims activity we're seeing. So as frequency and severity trends earn in, we'll be able to put that in the template and show that we were rate inadequate and then we'll be able to increase rates in California. For now, we're going to reduce our marketing spend in California to slow our growth and continue to be able to update that department. So we work with every department and every department is a little bit different. You can have filed unused, filed prior approval. So we work in with each department to make sure we give them the data they need to feel good about putting our rates on the street."

So we're watching the trends closely especially because they've changed so dramatically since March of last year. And so we're going to watch those trends, and we'll react swiftly. What I would say is that there's a lot that goes into a premium, including average written premium, and that can change and it reflects differently depending on states. So you might have a high average written premium state like Florida. And if you don't have the right rates and you don't grow there, that would affect countrywide. So there's still so many different inputs, including our consumers. So if you shrink in Sam's versus Robinsons', that will also affect average written premium because they have a higher average written premium. So we're getting there.

We do think it's great for our customers are Robinsons that want our brand, our home and auto bundles, so we'll continue to do that. But we know what we've done has started to work, but has not fully worked. Again, if you look at what has happened this year, a lot of it was based on catastrophes. If you look at and compared to the industry in more of the nonvolatile states, we're actually very competitive. So we knew we need to do something different. So last year, we took upgrade nearly 12 points this year, 8 points. And then we've talked about cost sharing with our customers. And more importantly, a couple of bigger things that we're doing to get us closer to our profitability is we're going to shift our portfolio of property over the next year or 2. So we have legacy states where ASI was really strong. And think of Texas and Florida, Louisiana through some of the hail alley. We've had a lot of catastrophes.
We have more exposure there because more of our book of business is there. So think of the rest of the state, nonvolatile the rest of the country, nonvolatile states is a little bit over 50% of our portfolio. We're going to shift that over time to be more in the 60% to 70% of our portfolio is shifting away from the volatile catastrophic coastal states. We are going to appoint more agents in those nonvolatile states, reduce our agent footprint in the volatile state and make that movement to have a more balanced portfolio. And I talked in my opening remarks about some targeted nonrenewals. We will start to commence that specifically in Florida. And we're going to work really around that focus on making sure we have more of a balanced portfolio. We still are very happy that we purchased ASI, now Progressive Home. We believe that's in our future. But our goal now is to get to profitability, and we believe the things that we're doing besides the rate increases, and I should mention continued segmentation. So that is a big piece of it. We're going to continue to enhance our segmentation like we have in the auto product. And we believe those levers will certainly help us get to where we want to go."

So when I think about conversion, I would go back to our decline in new apps. So on the agency side, they're down about 14%. We think that prospect denominator was elevated in 2020. So in 2020, there was virtually no shopping in Quarter 2. That moved to Quarter 3. And then this year, in addition, we pulled back on advertising. So we think conversion was stable. So we do think we still have a fairly competitive product on the direct side.
On the agency side, new apps were down about 20%. Prospects were down slightly, but conversion was down a lot. That was really due to material tight underwriting restrictions we put into place, rate increases, and there's like 3 big states where we have material drops in conversion. Again, the timing wise, that may be overstated even a bit based on the fact that there was a lot of stimulants going on at this time last year, and we also had high conversion in Michigan based on some coverage reform. But you talked specifically about the direct side. I think a lot of that has to do -- the reduction has to do with advertising from the new apps. So we feel good about our conversion. That could change as more rate come in and as we reduce more advertising. Do you guys want to add anything?"

So with direct advertising, you have the ability to generate quotes at a very local level. And if we have concerns on profitability in the area where we previously had higher conversion, we will shut off or reduce the ad spend in that area and that would then show the decrease in conversion just by that mix change. So when we're adjusting ad spend at the local level, you can see changes in conversion in total simply by that mix. So rate is one thing for sure. But interestingly, on the direct side, you can also influence conversion based on your marketing spend."

So it really depends on timing at each state. And remember, it's 5% in aggregate. So it's different in different states, depending on our needs. So that rate will continue to earn it. And that's one of the reasons why we continue to have the majority of our auto policies, our private passenger auto policies on a 6-month position.

I mean, new business has historically has a penalty win, it's put on the books, and it's different in agency and direct. That's why it's so important we talk a lot about our Holy Grail being renewal business because we start to understand our customers better. And on the direct side, we're loading all of our marketing costs on first 6 months all on the direct side. So I think when we look -- when I look at that, we look at a PIP differently, new PIP versus renewal PIF. Our renewal PIFs are still up. That could change. I think David asked a question about PLE, we're still up 4% across both channels and trailing 12 PLE. So we hope that continues, that could fluctuate depending on how much rate we need. And then again, with new -- with new PIFs, we are down slightly, maybe 10%. But again, that is very dependent on different commercial or tiers -- marketing tiers. So we're down much more on Sam. So that affects that as well. So there's a lot of different factors that go into both new and renewal. And did that answer your question? Or do you need more information?"

Of course, as Tricia mentioned, on direct business, there's a huge expense flow difference. So as we're writing fewer new customers that flows through an advertising spend as well. So there's certainly a benefit on spending less and getting fewer new customers in the direct set in terms of cost.
In terms of loss ratio, we see a bigger differential between new and renewal on the Sam of the spectrum than on the Robinson in the spectrum. So to the extent we are reducing Sam's coming through the door relative to Robinsons', it would have a bigger benefit on the loss ratio side. So there's some of that coming through, but you also have to recognize that our book is heavily, heavily weighted to renewal customers. So it can have some benefit. But in aggregate, we need the benefit of the rate flowing through the book, the new and renewal customers. It's going to flow through renewals sooner and there's far less elasticity in the renewal book. So you'll see average premiums rising sooner and more likely on the renewal side. On the new side, customers are shopping, and it's a highly elastic market. We'll see some of that rate. We'll see a little slower, and we'll probably see a little less of it simply because there are other options in the marketplace, and we move faster than others when it comes to taking rate when we need it. So we think and we've seen historically, at least, that competitors are seeing the same trends we are. They will need the same price changes. It may take them longer. So we might see a bit of imbalance on the new business front for a while. But again, our experience is competitors do the same thing. They catch up. And by the time they do, we're in a very good position and very confident in growing more and turning advertising back up and the other growth levers we have."

That can change at any time because plaintiff attorneys in Florida specifically, can challenge anything. And then you have to make sure you are thinking about the future. Do you have to reopen? What we try to do in anything like this happens where a case is lost by a competitor. And usually, when a case is lost by us or any competitor, it affects the majority of the competitors. And then we determine, is it worth fighting, how long, what does it mean exactly? And we work towards getting it wrapped up. And that's really what we're doing right now. We're trying to wrap this up. We're trying to do some bigger global settlement of maybe a law firm that has many of our insurers with this litigation to get it wrapped up quickly and as inexpensively as possible. I can't tell you that something won't be challenged next year. I will tell you that we've talked about it more internally because Florida PIP goes with these ebbs and flows of what happens depending on what happens with PIP reform or not.

We obviously have a number of where we think we start with and then we're going to try to work with our customers.
We also -- we'll give the customers an opportunity to stay with Progressive if they opt into the new roof payment schedule, which is where there will be some coverage option to share the cost of the replacement with us.

We do have -- we're offset a little bit with frequency on salvage returns. So we're going to watch that closely. What we haven't seen yet in body shops are labor rate increasing. They've been relatively flat. We'll watch that, especially when you think about talent in that area. And we have seen the labor -- I mean, parts price is up right around 5%.

Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's third quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us.During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers return to normal driving habits as the count",593,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and welcome to Progressive's third quarter conference call. We appreciate you joining us.
During our second quarter call, we discussed the challenges we were facing as our customers return to normal driving habits as the country opens in the pandemic and as supply constraints contributed to an unprecedented increase in vehicle valuation. In the third quarter, those challenges continued with the added effect of the most expensive storm in Progressive's history, Hurricane Ida. The result of these challenges is our first quarter with an above 100 CR in 20 years.
In true Progressive fashion, we are facing these challenges head on to do what's needed to meet our publicly stated goal of a 96 combined ratio on an annual basis.
As part of our efforts to ensure we meet our 96 targets, we are taking rate increases across our product lines. While objections and regulator scrutiny are part of the revision process, the pressures on the insurance pricing are real. The entire industry has been buffeted by the headwinds of higher severity, post-pandemic increased frequency and weather-related catastrophes. Regulators take their mandate of adequate rates seriously. And as such, we've been able to work with regulators to increase rates to meet the rising costs.
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have placed in-market increases in aggregate of 5 points in Personal Auto, 3 points in Commercial Lines and 8 points in Property. In Personal Auto, during the third quarter, rate increases were effective in 20 states, which had an average increase of about 6%. So we're taking the changes in the environment seriously and reacting decisively. We have more revisions and process across our suite of products as we work to ensure the rest of 2021 and 2022 meet our calendar year objectives.
Underwriting is another lever that we are using to address profitability. We continue to use this lever in Commercial and Personal Lines to ensure we write exposures accurately and that meet our underwriting targets. In Personal Auto, our 8.7 model, which is now in states representing about 40% of our premium further advances the science of underwriting.
In homeowners, where profitability has been under pressure for several quarters, we are taking additional steps to hasten our progress to meet our profit objectives. In states with high cat exposure, we have changed our underwriting roles to reduce our exposure, including targeted nonrenewals. While nonrenewals are not our preferred path, there are times where we need to use nontraditional methods to meet our targets.
While we take steps on the profitability side of the business, we continue to see strong growth. Personal Lines written premiums grew 7%, while Commercial Lines and homeowners both saw double-digit year-over-year written premium growth in the third quarter. Personal Lines and homeowners recorded PIF growth of 8% and 13% in the quarter, respectively. Commercial Auto continues to capitalize on the macroeconomic environment with its third straight quarter of double-digit PIF growth, largely due to growth in the for-hire trucking segment.
Though our underwriting actions often have the unfortunate side effect of reducing growth, our product managers continue to scour the competitive landscape to find profitable growth opportunities. Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank Mike Sieger, our Claims President; and Jeff Charney, our Chief Marketing Officer, for their contributions to Progressive and to offer my congratulations on their planned retirements. While I'm confident that their replacements are up to the task, Mike and Jeff's presence will be greatly missed.
Thank you, and I'm ready to take the first question."

And we watch it closely, especially because we have so much data from our usage-based insurance, our Snapshot. And there's a couple interesting trends that I'd like to share. And we're going to watch these closely again. There's been so many dynamic shifts since the pandemic that we really do have to watch and then react swiftly to the data. So if you look at vehicle miles traveled, they haven't really changed since the last call. They're still down about 6% to 8% from our 2017 and 2019 baseline. The bigger news that we've watched is frequency has picked up. And we've noticed that in each quarter, specifically in PD and collision. So let me give you a little bit of color on the things we watch for.
So during quarter 1, collision frequency was down about 10 points more than vehicle miles traveled. In quarter 2, that narrowed to 7 points. And in quarter 3, that narrowed further to 3 points. So we look at day parts. During quarter 3, that narrowing was kind of across the whole day. During quarter 3, we saw that frequency narrow more during the morning rush hours. So think of 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. While we see some evidence that there's congestion as well, it's a little bit surprising to us because people haven't fully returned to the office. We read the headlines in most companies because of the Delta variant have pushed off a full return to the office until January. So could it be that kids are going back to school. So we're taking our children to school. So there's other variables that we're watching really closely.
I think what will be interesting is to see what happens first quarter 2022 when many companies have stated they're going to return to work. And of course, what will that mean? It certainly won't mean full return for every single person, since I think there's going to be a lot of flexibility built in based on the pandemic. So we think that will be an interesting data point.
We also have observed frequency up sharply in the overnight hours. So think of like 1:00 am to 6:00 a.m., both weekends and weekdays and that correlated with the March reopening. And that frequency is above pre-COVID levels by about 10% to 20%. Again, a smaller amount of people driving. So we're watching VMTs closely by dayparts in each state, et cetera, and we'll be very interested to see how frequency continues to close the gap on vehicle miles traveled or not, but we're going to watch that closely. So we were able to get a lot of interesting information from our telematics data, and we're going to continue to watch that. Does that help, Mike?"

I think it's really hard to rely on historical metrics when we're looking at the data. So when you look at case IBNR or paid to incurred, whether you compare it to companies or even our own historical data, it's really hard without having underlying data. So we have changes to our closure rate, drop and then rebound in frequency, increase in severity. All those ratios change when you look at that.
What I would say about Progressive is that we feel very good about where we're at, again, with adequate, with minimal variation. We're about 0.5 point unfavorable for the year, and the majority of that can be attributed to -- for the PIP. So we don't believe there's conservative, and we have not changed our model."

So what I was referring to was now we're in a much different place and severity trends are up 10 points, and we need rates.

And so different states look at it differently. So as you look at say like a California, their Department of Insurance requires us to look backwards to fill up a template. So while California was a little bit behind in frequency, it has picked up and is actually outpacing countrywide at this point. And so when you fill up those templates, those rate indications are going to be distorted based on the data from last year.
What we believe will happen is it's not reflective of the claims activity we're seeing. So as frequency and severity trends earn in, we'll be able to put that in the template and show that we will -- we were rate inadequate and then we'll be able to increase rates in California. For now, we're going to reduce our marketing spend in California to slow our growth and continue to be able to update that department. So we work with every department, and every department is a little bit different. You can have file in use, you can file prior approval.

So we're watching the trends closely, especially because they've changed so dramatically since March of last year. And so we're going to watch those trends, and we'll react swiftly.
What I would say is that there's a lot that goes into a premium, including average written premium, and that can change and it reflects differently depending on states. So you might have a high average written premium state like Florida. And if you don't have the right rates and you don't grow there, that would affect countrywide. So there's still so many different inputs, including our consumers. So if you shrink in Sam's versus Robinsons', that will also affect average written premium because they have a higher average written premium. So we're getting there. We believe we'll need more, and then we'll continue to watch the trends again as they unfold.

We do think it's great for our customers, our Robinsons that want our brand, our home and auto bundles, so we'll continue to do that. But we know what we've done has started to work, but has not fully worked.
Again, if you look at what has happened this year, a lot of it was based on catastrophes. If you look at and compare it to the industry in more of the nonvolatile states, we're actually very competitive. So we knew we need to do something different. So last year, we took up rates nearly 12 points; this year, 8 points. And then we've talked about cost sharing with our customers. And more importantly, a couple of bigger things that we're doing to get us closer to our profitability is we're going to shift our portfolio of property over the next year or 2. So we have legacy states where ASI was really strong. And think of Texas and Florida or Louisiana through some of the hail alley. We've had a lot of catastrophes.
We have more exposure there because more of our book of business is there. So think of the rest of the state, nonvolatile and the rest of the country. Nonvolatile states is a little bit over 50% of our portfolio. We're going to shift that over time to be more in the 60% to 70% of our portfolio, so shifting away from the volatile catastrophic coastal states. We are going to appoint more agents in those nonvolatile states, reduce our agent footprint in the volatile states and make that movement to have a more balanced portfolio.
And I talked in my opening remarks about some targeted nonrenewals. We will start to commence that specifically in Florida. And we're going to work really around that focus on making sure we have more of a balanced portfolio. We still are very happy that we purchased ASI, now Progressive Home. We believe that's in our future. But our goal now is to get to profitability, and we believe the things that we're doing besides the rate increases, and I should mention continued segmentation. So that is a big piece of it. We're going to continue to enhance our segmentation like we have in the auto product. And we believe those levers will certainly help us get to where we want to go."

So when I think about conversion, I would go back to our decline in new apps. So on the agency side, they're down about 14%. We think that prospect denominator was elevated in 2020. So in 2020, there was virtually no shopping in quarter 2. That moved to quarter 3. And then this year, in addition, we pulled back on advertising. So we think conversion was stable. So we do think we still have a fairly competitive product on the direct side.
On the agency side, new apps were down about 20%. Prospects were down slightly, but conversion was down a lot. That was really due to material tight underwriting restrictions we put into place, rate increases and there's like 3 big states where we have material drops in conversion. Again, the timing-wise, that may be overstated even a bit based on the fact that there was a lot of stimulus going on at this time last year, and we also had high conversion in Michigan based on some coverage reform. But you talked specifically about the direct side. I think a lot of that has to do -- the reduction has to do with advertising from the new apps. So we feel good about our conversion. That could change as more rates come in and as we reduce more advertising. Do you guys want to add anything?"

So with direct advertising, you have the ability to generate quotes at a very local level. And if we have concerns on profitability in the area where we previously had higher conversion, we will shut off or reduce the ad spend in that area and that would then show the decrease in conversion just by that mix change. So when we're adjusting ad spend at the local level, you can see changes in conversion in total simply by that mix. So rate is one thing for sure. But interestingly, on the direct side, you can also influence conversion based on your marketing spend."

So it really depends on timing at each state. And remember, it's 5% in aggregate. So it's different in different states, depending on our needs. So that rate will continue to earn in. And that's one of the reasons why we continue to have the majority of our auto policies, our private passenger auto policies on a 6-month position.

That's why it's so important we talk a lot about our Holy Grail being renewal business because we start to understand our customers better. And on the direct side, we're loading all of our marketing costs on that first 6 months policy on the direct side.
So I think when we look -- when I look at that, we look at PIFs differently, new PIFs versus renewal PIFs. Our renewal PIFs are still up. That could change. I think David asked a question about PLE, we're still up 4% across both channels and trailing 12 PLE. So we hope that continues. That could fluctuate depending on how much rate we need. And then again, with new PIFs, we are down slightly, maybe 10%. But again, that is very dependent on different commercial or tiers -- marketing tiers. So we're down much more on Sam. So that affects that as well. So there's a lot of different factors that go into both new and renewal. And -- did that answer your question or do you need more information?"

Of course, as Tricia mentioned, on direct business, there's a huge expense flow difference. So as we're writing, fewer new customers that flows through an advertising spend as well. So there's certainly a benefit on spending less and getting fewer new customers in the direct set in terms of cost.
In terms of loss ratio, we see a bigger differential between new and renewal on the Sam of the spectrum than on the Robinson in the spectrum. So to the extent we are reducing Sam's coming through the door relative to Robinsons', it would have a bigger benefit on the loss ratio side. So there's some of that coming through, but you also have to recognize that our book is heavily, heavily weighted to renewal customers. So it can have some benefit. But in aggregate, we need the benefit of the rate flowing through the book, the new and renewal customers. It's going to flow through renewals sooner and there's far less elasticity in the renewal book. So you'll see average premiums rising sooner and more likely on the renewal side.
On the new side, customers are shopping and it's a highly elastic market. We'll see some of that rate. We'll see a little slower, and we'll probably see a little less of it simply because there are other options in the marketplace, and we move faster than others when it comes to taking rate when we need it. So we think and we've seen historically, at least, that competitors are seeing the same trends we are. They will need the same price changes. It may take them longer. So we might see a bit imbalance on the new business front for a while. But again, our experience is, competitors see the same thing. They catch up and by the time they do, we're in a very good position and very confident in growing more and turning advertising back up and the other growth levers we have."

With what we have currently, we feel very good about our reserving for PIP and where we're going. That can change at any time because plaintiff attorneys in Florida, specifically, can challenge anything. And then you have to make sure you are thinking about the future. Do you have to reopen?
What we try to do in anything like this happens where a case is lost by a competitor and usually, when a case is lost by us or any competitor, it affects the majority of the competitors. And then we determine, is it worth fighting, how long, what does it mean exactly? And we work towards getting it wrapped up. And that's really what we're doing right now. We're just trying to wrap this up. We're trying to do some bigger global settlement of maybe a law firm that has many of our insurers with this litigation to get it wrapped up quickly and as inexpensively as possible.
I can't tell you that something won't be challenged next year. I will tell you that we've talked about it more internally because Florida PIP goes with these ebbs and flows of what happens depending on what happens with PIP reform or not.

That still does put you below where frequency -- frequency and severity are on a combined basis. Tricia, I think earlier in the call, you said that it would probably take more than 3 to 6 months for all this rate to pull through the system. So when you make that comment, are you thinking that you will, at some point, get the approvals and get rates in excess of trends? Or are you also assuming maybe that severity, which has been elevated and impacted by the supply chain issues that over that time period, severity trends might improve? Or maybe it's a combination of both?"

So we'll have to watch and see what happens with the supply of chips. Does that open up the supply-demand of new cars and used parts? We do have -- we're offset a little bit with frequency on salvage returns. So we're going to watch that closely. What we haven't seen yet in body shops are labor rate increasing. They've been relatively flat. We'll watch that, especially when you think about talent in that area. And we have seen the labor -- I mean, parts price is up right around 5%.
