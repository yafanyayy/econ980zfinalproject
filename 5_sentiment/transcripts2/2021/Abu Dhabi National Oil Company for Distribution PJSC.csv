So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ADNOC Distribution Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results. In today's call, we will take you through the key highlights of Q4 and full year 2020. We will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update and financial performance and finally move on to the outlook for 2021. We will then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation.
Let me start with -- let -- please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements. So this presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in other investor communication, all of which are available on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information.
Let me start with the executive summary with the 2020 key highlights. We now take you to the 2020 key highlights, and our CEO and CFO would provide further insights on our strategy and the financial performance. ADNOC Distribution demonstrated a resilient performance and accelerated delivery of its smart growth plan in 2020, despite market uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the end of June 2020 and following the initial COVID impact on transport mobility, the company retail fuel volume, which account for more than 65% of our total volume, continue to show steady recovery. Our retail volumes have recovered around 92% in Q4 2020 compared to Q4 2019.
Despite lower volumes compared to last year, our EBITDA increased by 12% in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of one-offs and further provisioning, the underlying EBITDA has grown by 32% year-on-year in 2020. This solid growth was driven by higher retail fuel margins, as you know; market share gain in Dubai; management initiatives to increase margin; enhance customer experience; and optimize our operating expenses. Secondly, we have accelerated the delivery of our growth plans, and this was expected since last year by the market. Our Fuel Station Network in the UAE has increased by more than 15% to 445 stations by the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. This represents 10x higher rate new stations delivery compared to 2019 levels.
If you look now at our convinced stores, the network has grown by around 23% to [ 326 ] stores. Our key priority in the UAE remains Dubai where we are gaining incremental volumes and EBITDA. We have now 26 stations in Dubai compared to only 6 stations at the end of 2019. In addition to the UAE expansion, we accelerated our expansion in Saudi Arabia, and we are now signing a definitive agreement to acquire 35 stations in line with our ambitious international growth strategy.
As part of the company's ongoing transformation, we also remain committed to reducing our operating costs and ensuring our continued competitiveness globally.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns and opined by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, we expect to pay $700 million. The company has already paid an interim dividend for the first 6 months in October 2020, and the Board has recommended to pay second half dividend by -- in April 2021. So we are talking about AED 10.28 per share subject to the shareholder approval at the upcoming AGM on the 16th March of 2021.
The company's dividend -- 2021 dividend policy is set to continue with a dividend of $700 million. Yesterday, our Board further recommended amendments to the dividend policy to enhance visibility of shareholder return, proposing a minimum of $700 million dividend for 2022 compared to a minimum 75% of distributable income as per the current policy, and the dividend equal to at least 75% of distributable profits from 2023 almost. This proposal will be presented to the company's shareholders at the upcoming AGM on 16th of March. If approved, this will provide secured and predictable payback to shareholders until April 2023. Amendment in dividend policy recommended by the Board recognizes the company's strong financial position, and Mohamed Al Hashemi will describe in a couple of minutes, our confidence also in the close prospect on the cash flow generation ability going forward for ADNOC Distribution. Despite current market conditions, our company remains confident and fast in delivery of its strategic commitment at sustainable returns for its shareholders.
Finally, in 2020, a key milestone for ADNOC Distribution shares has been achieved with doubling free flow to 20%, after our parent company, ADNOC, sold 1.25 billion ADNOC Distribution shares through a $1 billion placement on the 14th September last year. Following this transaction, ADNOC Distribution shares have witnessed a significant increase in trading activity on the ADNOC Distribution Stock Exchange. Also, increase in free float now makes us eligible for a potential inclusion in MSCI and Food CM Indices, likely in Q2 and Q3 of this year. This is expected to further diversify our shareholder base and bring passive inflows into ADNOC Distribution shares, ranging between $200 million to $220 million as per the analyst estimates.
Just to put things into perspective, this represents more than 20% of 2020 trading activity. I will now hand over to Ahmed for an update on our growth strategy and its progress so far. Over to you, Ahmed?"

Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone staying safe and healthy. As you can see, this slide shows overview of growth strategy progress since beginning of 2020, with the ambitious growth targets for 2020. And we've not only met, but exceeded guidance in terms of both new station openings and convenience store refurbishments.
In 2020, we opened 64 new stations in the UAE, including 20 in Dubai, compared to our guidance of 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We also exceeded our C-stores digitalization target of 80 to 90 by refurbishing regis teres. In addition, we demonstrated strong to grow in international markets by signing agreements to acquire 35 stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
To provide further color on our growth, let me begin with our Fuel business, which includes our retail and commercial customers. As mentioned, we opened 64 stations in the UAE in 2020, including 27 in Q4 2020. This total fuel stations we operate in the UAE to 445 stations. We remain focused on value assertive and underpenetrated Dubai market by opening 20 new stations in 2020. We have now 26 stations in Dubai by the end of 2020, which is 4x more than the level compared to end of 2019. 
Dubai is delivering as per our plans with double-digit growth in fuel volumes sold in 2020, driven by new station openings. We expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as full impact of our 2020 station openings become visible in 2021, and as we open more stations this year.
Since we increased LPG cylinder prices in Abu Dhabi and in Northern Emirates at the end of July 2020, we are on track to realize our guidance of additional close to $20 million annualized EBITDA from this initiative.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we reaffirmed our commitment to grow in international markets by announcing a signing of definitive agreement at the end December 2020 to acquire 15 stations in Saudi Arabia. Yesterday, we announced signing of 2 more definitive agreements to acquire a total of 20 more stations in Saudi Arabia.
With the acquisition of 35 stations in the Kingdom for a total purchase price of $25.5 million, our network would increase from 2 stations at the end of 2019 to 37 stations completion of these transactions, which are subject to pending regularity approvals.
Our targeted IRR is at least 15% in each of these transactions, in line with what we promised to the market for all our investments. Following closing of the transactions, we expect increase in EBITDA contribution of these stations as ADNOC Distribution is qualified to receive higher fuel margin, i.e. AED 15 on gasoline versus AED 9 currently. And AED 5 in diesel versus AED 3.5 currently. In addition to the 31 stations that were operational in 2019, 3 stations were recently opened end of 2020, and 1 station will open in Q1 2021. These 4 stations are expected to contribute additional 50 million liters and EBITDA of approximately $1 million, at higher fuel margin. We expect to create further value from these acquisitions by refurbishing then -- in line with ADNOC Distribution's fourth class brand standards. And staff will be trained to adhere to the companies renewed service excellence to offer high-quality retail service to customers, including convenience stores.
Finally, we are currently evaluating several more opportunities to accelerate profitable and disciplined growth in Saudi Arabia to unlock further value to our shareholders.
I will now move to our non-fuel retail business. We opened 62 new convenience stores in UAE in 2020, leading to increase in our key store network to 326 as of 31st of December 2020. We have seen a strong momentum in retaliation of our convenience stores and successfully refurbished and modernized 100 Oasis convenience stores in 2020, or around 40% of our total number of C-stores that we operated at the end of 2019.
Our customer-centric focus is an integral part of our digital transformation strategy, which aims to offer superior customer experience through various initiatives as. Firstly, we announced an enhancement of our loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards, in July by introducing points-based system. This makes the fairest loyalty program of its kind by a fuel provider in the region. The program reached significant milestone of having more than 1 million registered customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. Secondly, our online home delivery service of more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has also been received very well by our customers, and we have expanded it for more than 100 Oasis stores. As a result of our various customer-centric initiatives, such as improved category management, the introduction of fresh food and premium coffee offerings and driven by changing customer shutting behavior during pandemic, average gross basket size increased by around 18.8% year-on-year in 2020.
I will now hand over to Ahmed Al Hashemi to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you."

Thanks, Ahmed. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. So I will now take you through our financial performance in 2020. So obviously, as all of you are aware, it's been a very, very challenging operating environment, but ADNOC Distribution",1722,"Thank you. Thanks, Ahmed. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. So I will now take you through our financial performance in 2020. So obviously, as all of you are aware, it's been a very, very challenging operating environment, but ADNOC Distribution has demonstrated resilient financial and operational performance in 2020.
Our revenue decreased by 24.4% compared to 2019. Now this was driven by both lower fuel volume, lower nonfuel revenues as well as lower oil prices in 2020 compared to 2019. On the flip side, the 2020 gross profit increased by 16.2% compared to 2019. This, of course, was driven by higher retail fuel margin, as the retail fuel pump prices did not fully comply with the fuel supply cost, which is linked to the crude oil prices as well as the refined product pricing in that.
Our 2020 EBITDA is USD 868 million, which is an increase of 12.3% despite the negative impact of $146 million of one-off expense. These one-off expenses were somewhat offset by inventory gains of $27 million in 2020 compared to the inventory gains of $33 million in 2019.
One-off expenses. The one-off -- sorry, just having a bit of audio trouble. Give me a second. The one-off expenses during the quarter were mainly as a result of food and approach, which I'm convinced, puts the company in a resilient position for profitable growth ahead. Given the materiality of these one-offs, let me provide a bit more detail on what exactly we book during 2020. So USD 52 million was capital work in progress. This was a with write-off. So what we've done? Since I joined the company finance function in October, one of the first activities was the comprehensive review of the capital working profit, and we took a prudent to write-off legacy assets from the balance sheet. And these are assets which are not being utilized as a result of the organization upgrading to smart technology, smart technology-enabled fueling and payment options, which we have undertaken in order to offer increased customer convenience and safety in light of the impact from COVID-19. That's one of the factors. The second one was roughly $23 million. This is staff restructuring costs. The full amount was booked in the third quarter of 2020. As part of our OpEx optimization initiative, we booked nonrecurring staff restructuring costs, which of course leads us to a higher operating expenditure. Now we expect benefits of this restructuring to be visible going forward. This should lead to a meaningful reduction in our staff costs. This, of course, remains a major [indiscernible]
Continuing on the material one-offs, was USD 19 million that we provisioned on trade receivables in light of the current environment, which places an undue amount of pressure on some of our customers. So in light of that, we booked about 19 in total, of which USD 1.7 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to that, we've got about $52 million of other one-offs, of which about USD 2.9 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now these included additional pension cost contribution that we need to make on behalf of our employees, business transformation cost as well as COVID-19 related expenses.
Moving on to the underlying EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA, which excludes gains or losses in inventory as well as one-off remain strong. So the underlying EBITDA demonstrated growth of 31.6% in 2020. And fourth quarter alone was 51.6% higher compared to the same period last year. So the growth was driven by higher fuel retail margins, of course, but also supported by like-for-like OpEx savings. The 2020 net profit is USD 662 million. This is a 9.7% increase when compared to 2019. Besides the higher EBITDA, this was offset by higher depreciation as well as lower interest income.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2020. In 2020, our total fuel volumes decreased by 10.5% year-on-year. This was mainly due to an impact of COVID-19 that started hitting us in March 2020. Retail fuel volumes declined by 11.8% in 2020, compared to the same period last year. On the commercial side, the fuel volumes decreased by 8% year-on-year. Total fuel volume for the fourth quarter of the year increased by 2.3% compared to Q3 2020. Retail fuel volumes increased by 1.6% as compared to the prior quarter, but still remain 8.3% below fourth quarter 2019. Now this is impacted by ongoing Abu Dhabi border restriction, many organizations continuing to allow remote working as well as schools remaining closed or not consistently open while the challenges from COVID-19 continue to impact the economy.
On the commercial fuel side, our commercial fuel volumes were down in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 5.2% year-on-year. This, of course, was mainly driven by a lower uplift from our strategic aviation customers. These are government customers. On the nonfuel business, our nonfuel transactions decreased by 33.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to COVID-19 led decline in customer visits. That was one factor. Compared to 2019, another factor was the absence of vouchers that we used to give out when customers take the hubs for assisted fueling. That of course ended in November 2019. So the bulk of 2020, what we're seeing is lower customer visits into the store, once again due to the impact from COVID-19 as well as what we think is the absence of vouchers.
However, the average gross basket size the same growth and increased by 18.8% year-on-year in 2020. We believe this is driven by changing consumer shopping pattern during the pandemic, so the customers are visiting us less frequently, but when they do, they buy more during each visit. This was also supported by our customer-centric initiative, like improvement in category management as well as convenient features like online delivery.
Let's move on to gross profit performance by sector. The 2020 gross profit increased by 16.2%, driven by: one, the retail segment gross profit, which increased by 28.3% year-on-year. This was driven by the fuel retail business, which posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of about 38.4% year-on-year. This was, of course, is on the impact of higher retail fuel margins as the retail pump prices, what I mentioned earlier, did not fully fall in line with the crude oil prices as well as the refined product pricing impact as well as due to the reduction in fuel costs following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract, which was effective from November 2019, when we ended Flex.
On the nonfuel retail gross profit side, this was impacted by lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and, as I mentioned a few moments ago, due to the absence of voucher redemption after implementing free assisted fueling.
On the commercial business side, the gross profit was negatively impacted due to lower volumes and one-off, whereas 2019 included one-off recovery.
Moving downward, segment-wise EBITDA performance. As I mentioned before, our 2020 EBITDA increased by 12.3%, despite the $146 million of one-off expenses that I discussed a few moments ago. The retail EBITDA increased on the back of higher retail margins. Offset, however, by lower fuel volume, decline in nonfuel profit as well as the increase in the one-off OpEx.
Our 2020 commercial EBITDA declined, once again, due to lower volumes than other one-offs. On the flip side, in 2019, on the commercial side, the 2019 EBITDA included one-off recovery and reversal. The unallocated EBITDA, as you can see on the slide [indiscernible] write-off, as covered earlier.
Moving on to the OpEx update. If we look to our operating expenses, the total OpEx increased in 2020 by [indiscernible]. This was mainly due to one-off expenses as it relates to staff restructuring costs; additional pension cost contribution, which we have to make on behalf of our employees; expenses that we could not have planned for because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related complexities; OpEx related to growth, which, of course, is directly affiliated with our network expansion as we expand the network, OpEx continues to grow; as well as the cost of additional staff, given that we have now, since November 2019, ended Flex in the offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, free of charge price. Having said that, however, we have seen good momentum in cost optimization initiatives in 2020. We've accelerated, and we are on good track, and the benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken throughout the year are now visible with like-for-like OpEx savings of $15 million year-on-year in 2020. After the accompany, the organization achieved USD 100 million over 2018 and 2019. This further reduction is mainly as a result of optimization in staff costs as well as decrease in general and admin expenses.
While we -- as an organization, while we have been diligently focused on the nature of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the safety and the well-being of our staff and customers, the transformation effort that we have initiated in 2020. We have discussed with the market. We'll continue to ensure that the operating costs are market competitive, and ADNOC Distribution remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth ambitions.
So looking at the cash position. So looking at the cash generation, we generated free cash flow of USD 195 million in 2020, driven by strong cash flow from operational. Our cash position reduced in 2020 compared to end of 2019 due to negative working capital movements, higher capital expenditure and, of course, the dividend payments. In line with our guidance from to continue with our expansion strategy, we have spent a higher amount of capital expenditure, totaling up to USD 266 million in 2020. Now this is approximately twice the amount we spent in 2019. So 80% of our capital expenditure is growth oriented. This is of course driven by the higher number of new stations that we continue to build and open.
On the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio side, as of December 31, 2020, this ratio was 0.85. This is an increase from 0.26 at December 31, 2019. But of course, we remain well below 2x as for our commitment.
So at this point, let me hand it back over to the Ahmed to summarize our 2021 outlook. Over to you, ahmed?"

So allow me to update you now on the outlook and the strategic priorities for this year. After a strong financial performance in 2020 and accelerated delivery of our strategic growth plan, we expect the momentum to sustain in 2021, driven by, first of all, the delivery of 70 to 80 new stations across our domestic and international network. Of these, 30 to 35 new stations are expected in the UAE, of which 12 to 18 in Dubai. In Saudi Arabia, we expect to add 40 to 50 -- 40 -- -- sorry, to 45 new patients, of which 35 are already announced through acquisitions, and we expect, therefore, 5 to 10 organic build out to be completed in 2021.
Our guidance does not include potential new M&A opportunities. We are currently evaluating. Secondly, our -- we expect fuel volumes to grow compared to 2021, driven by progressive recovery at vaccine roll out allowed in mobility restrictions and also driven by the contribution from significantly higher number of new stations delivered in Dubai in 2020 and expected volumes from Saudi Arabia.
Third, in our nonfuel business, we expect to refurbish 40 to 60 stores this year, in line with our target to refurbish our entire store same-store network by 2022-2023.
Four, after making a significant progress in our OpEx optimization initiative in 2020, we remain committed to achieve further operational excellence and pursue incremental savings of around $25 million in 2021 and around $85 million over 2021, 2023. So our guidance remains unchanged.
So in 2021, finally, we expect CapEx of around $250 million to $300 million, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth and offer best-in-class services to our customers. This will now end the presentation, and we are open to any questions. The only thing I wanted to add, sorry, is that we remain confident that we will deliver our long-term strategic commitment to reach at least $1 billion EBITDA target by 2023. We are also confident to sustain attractive dividend returns by strong balance sheet and confidence in our cash flow generation capability, while retaining sufficient cash to support the growth in both domestic and international markets. So this concludes today's presentation. We are happy now to take any questions you may have. Thank you."

So can you give us some guidance around how much that number could be? And finally, I just wanted to understand on your fuel retail margins, you obviously saw very high margins this year, around 70 to 75 per liter versus 40 or 45 that you saw over the last 2 years.

If you look at the potential value creation, on the top of this, if you look at 31 stations, which is more than 85% of these stations in part at the moment, the kind of margins that uplift, that our CFO was mentioning earlier. So there is clearly an upside for the story. And if you look just at the Saudi players, listed in Saudi, you're going to see that the UAE EBITDA is above 10x. So clearly, there is even value that we're going to crystallize through these acquisitions. Second part of the answer regarding the Saudi acquisition. The valuation reflects the EBITDA contribution, and some of the new stations we acquired with the second transactions are large stations with high throughput and are also qualified for higher fuel margin.

For EBITDA of $3 million in 2019, once we complete the acquisition, we expect that to go up. How much? Well, we can tell you the gross profit between 43% to 67%.

The 4 stations that we've also acquired, taking us a total of 35. 3 have been opened in December of 2020; 1 opened in the first quarter of this year, not long at all -- not long ago.

The next question goes. [indiscernible] answer the questions. Mohamed, do you see any question from the webcast? 
Okay. Mohamed, we're not able to hear you. So let me address some of the questions that we're getting on the webcast. I think it important question. I'll go and address one of them. Is the current status that pricing in UAE. So the question is has it reverted back to the pre-COVID mechanism of market pricing, which should we expect to like-for-like fuel margins to be lower for 2021? I think that's a good question. And the answer to that is, at present, we have not reverted back to pre-COVID mechanism. There is a floor, support offered by the Ministry of Energy. This, of course, commenced last year, and that is there in place as we see for the month of February. Now when it's going to end? We do not have any visibility. But presumably, should then sometime rather sooner than later.
Of course, we should expect the like-for-like fuel margin to be lower and revert back to the margin guarantee that's in place for 2021.
Another question that I'm seeing is the new stations that we acquired recently, higher valuation than the 15 stations in the Eastern province. The valuations that been set based on throughput, based on size of the station and based on a, of course, the hurdle rate that we expect -- the returns that we expect from these stations. So based on that, we're setting the valuation of these new stations that we're acquiring in Saudi. Of course, evaluation is reflective of the EBITDA contribution. What you see in the second transaction, higher valuation means that these are larger stations, higher throughput. And of course, it looks like the other station are also qualified by the higher fuel margin."

So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ADNOC Distribution Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Results. In today's call, we will take you through the key highlights of Q4 and full year 2020. We will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update and financial performance and finally move on to the outlook for 2021. We will then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation.
Let me start with -- let -- please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements. So this presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in other investor communication, all of which are available on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information.
Let me start with the executive summary with the 2020 key highlights. We now take you through the 2020 key highlights, and our CEO and CFO would provide further insights on our strategy and the financial performance. ADNOC Distribution demonstrated a resilient performance and accelerated delivery of its smart growth plan in 2020, despite market uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the end of June 2020 and following the initial COVID impact on transport mobility, the company retail fuel volume, which account for more than 65% of our total volume, continue to show steady recovery. Our retail volumes have recovered around 92% in Q4 2020 compared to Q4 2019.
Despite lower volumes compared to last year, our EBITDA increased by 12% in 2020 compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of one-offs and further provisioning, the underlying EBITDA has grown by 32% year-on-year in 2020. This solid growth was driven by higher retail fuel margins, as you know; market share gain in Dubai; management initiatives to increase margin; enhance customer experience; and optimize our operating expenses. Secondly, we have accelerated the delivery of our growth plans, and this was expected since last year by the market. Our fuel station network in the UAE has increased by more than 15% to 445 stations by the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. This represents 10x higher rate new stations delivery compared to 2019 levels.
If you look now at our convenience stores, the network has grown by around 23% to 326 stores. Our key priority in the UAE remains Dubai where we are gaining incremental volumes and EBITDA. We have now 26 stations in Dubai compared to only 6 stations at the end of 2019. In addition to the UAE expansion, we accelerated our expansion in Saudi Arabia, and we are now signing a definitive agreement to acquire 35 stations in line with our ambitious international growth strategy.
As part of the company's ongoing transformation, we also remain committed to reducing our operating costs and ensuring our continued competitiveness globally.
Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high dividend visibility to our shareholders. For 2020, we expect to pay $700 million. The company has already paid an interim dividend for the first 6 months in October 2020, and the Board has recommended to pay second half dividend by -- in April 2021. So we are talking about AED 0.1028 per share subject to the shareholder approval at the upcoming AGM on the 16 March of 2021.
The company's dividend -- 2021 dividend policy is set to continue with a dividend of $700 million. Yesterday, our Board further recommended amendments to the dividend policy to enhance visibility of shareholder return, proposing a minimum of $700 million dividend for 2022 compared to a minimum 75% of distributable income as per the current policy, and the dividend equal to at least 75% of distributable profits from 2023 onwards. This proposal will be presented to the company's shareholders at the upcoming AGM on 16th of March. If approved, this will provide secured and predictable payback to shareholders until April 2023. Amendment in dividend policy recommended by the Board recognizes the company's strong financial position, and Mohamed Al Hashimi will describe in a couple of minutes, our confidence also in the cost prospect on the cash flow generation ability going forward for ADNOC Distribution. Despite current market conditions, our company remains confident and steadfast in delivery of its strategic commitment at sustainable returns for its shareholders.
Finally, in 2020, a key milestone for ADNOC Distribution shares has been achieved with doubling free flow to 20%, after our parent company, ADNOC, sold 1.25 billion ADNOC Distribution shares through a $1 billion institutional placement on the 14th September last year. Following this transaction, ADNOC Distribution shares have witnessed a significant increase in trading activity on the ADNOC Distribution Stock Exchange. Also, increase in free float now makes us eligible for a potential inclusion in MSCI and FTSE EM Indices, likely in Q2 and Q3 of this year. This is expected to further diversify our shareholder base and bring passive inflows into ADNOC Distribution shares, ranging between $200 million to $220 million as per the analyst estimates.
Just to put things into perspective, this represents more than 20% of 2020 trading activity. I will now hand over to Ahmed for an update on our growth strategy and its progress so far. Over to you, Ahmed."

Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone staying safe and healthy. As you can see, this slide shows overview of growth strategy progress since beginning of 2020. We set ambitious growth targets for 2020. And we've not only met, but exceeded guidance in terms of both new station openings and convenience store refurbishments.
In 2020, we opened 64 new stations in the UAE, including 20 in Dubai, compared to our guidance of 50 to 60 new stations in the UAE. We also exceeded our C-stores digitalization target of 80 to 90 by refurbishing 100 C-stores. In addition, we demonstrated strong commitment to grow in international markets by signing agreements to acquire 35 stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
To provide further color on our growth, let me begin with our Fuel business, which includes our retail and commercial customers. As mentioned, we opened 64 stations in the UAE in 2020, including 27 in Q4 2020. This takes total fuel stations we operate in the UAE to 445 stations. We remain focused on value assertive and underpenetrated Dubai market by opening 20 new stations in 2020. We have now 26 stations in Dubai by the end of 2020, which is 4x more than the level compared to end of 2019. 
Dubai is delivering as per our plans with double-digit growth in fuel volumes sold in 2020, driven by new station openings. We expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as full impact of our 2020 station openings become visible in 2021, and as we open more stations this year.
Since we increased LPG cylinder prices in Abu Dhabi and in Northern Emirates at the end of July 2020, we are on track to realize our guidance of additional close to $20 million annualized EBITDA from this initiative.
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we reaffirmed our commitment to grow in international markets by announcing a signing of definitive agreement at the end December 2020 to acquire 15 stations in Saudi Arabia. Yesterday, we announced signing of 2 more definitive agreements to acquire a total of 20 more stations in Saudi Arabia.
With the acquisition of 35 stations in the Kingdom for a total purchase price of $25.5 million, our network would increase from 2 stations at the end of 2019 to 37 stations upon completion of these transactions, which are subject to pending regularity (sic) [ regulatory ] approvals.
Our targeted IRR is at least 15% in each of these transactions, in line with what we promised to the market for all our investments. Following closing of the transactions, we expect increase in EBITDA contribution of these stations as ADNOC Distribution is qualified to receive higher fuel margin, i.e. SAR 0.15 on gasoline versus SAR 0.09 currently. And SAR 0.05 in diesel versus SAR 0.035 currently. 
In addition to the 31 stations that were operational in 2019, 3 stations were recently opened end of 2020, and 1 station will open in Q1 2021. These 4 stations are expected to contribute additional 50 million liters and EBITDA of approximately $1 million, at higher fuel margin. We expect to create further value from these acquisitions by refurbishing them in line with ADNOC Distribution's world-class brand standards. And staff will be trained to adhere to the company's renewed service excellence to offer high-quality retail service to customers, including convenience stores.
Finally, we are currently evaluating several more opportunities to accelerate profitable and disciplined growth in Saudi Arabia to unlock further value to our shareholders.
I will now move to our non-fuel retail business. We opened 62 new convenience stores in UAE in 2020, leading to increase in our key store network to 326 as of 31st of December 2020. We have seen a strong momentum in revitalization of our convenience stores and successfully refurbished and modernized 100 Oasis convenience stores in 2020, or around 40% of our total number of C-stores that we operated at the end of 2019.
Our customer-centric focus is an integral part of our digital transformation strategy, which aims to offer superior customer experience through various initiatives as below. Firstly, we announced an enhancement of our loyalty program, ADNOC Rewards in July by introducing points-based system. This makes it the fairest loyalty program of its kind by a fuel provider in the region. The program reached significant milestone of having more than 1 million registered customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. Secondly, our online home delivery service of more than 1,700 products from our Oasis convenience stores has also been received very well by our customers, and we have expanded it for more than 100 C-stores. As a result of our various customer-centric initiatives, such as improved category management, the introduction of fresh food and premium coffee offerings and driven by changing customer shopping behavior during pandemic, average gross basket size increased by around 18.8% year-on-year in 2020.
I will now hand over to Ahmed Al Hashemi to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Mohamed Al Hashimi."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. So I will now take you through our financial performance in 2020.

So I will now take you through our financial performance in 2020. So obviously, as all of you are aware, it's been a very, very challenging operating environment, but ADNOC Distribution has demonstrated resilient financial and operational performance in 2020.
Our revenue decreased by 24.4% compared to 2019. Now this was driven by both lower fuel volume, lower nonfuel revenues as well as lower oil prices in 2020 compared to 2019. On the flip side, the 2020 gross profit increased by 16.2% compared to 2019. This, of course, was driven by higher retail fuel margin, as the retail fuel pump prices did not fully comply with the fuel supply cost, which is linked to the crude oil prices as well as the refined product pricing in that.
Our 2020 EBITDA is USD 868 million, which is an increase of 12.3% despite the negative impact of $146 million of one-off expense. These one-off expenses were somewhat offset by inventory gains of $27 million in 2020 compared to the inventory gains of $33 million in 2019.
Our one-off expenses. The one-off -- sorry, just having a bit of audio trouble. Give me a second. The one-off expenses during the quarter were mainly as a result of prudent approach, which I'm convinced, puts the company in a resilient position for profitable growth ahead. Given the materiality of these one-offs, let me provide a bit more detail on what exactly we booked during 2020. 
So USD 52 million was capital work in progress. This was a CWIP write-off. So what we've done? Since I joined the company, they did finance function in October, one of the first activities was the comprehensive review of the capital working profit, and we took a prudent decision to write-off legacy assets from the balance sheet. And these are assets which are not being utilized as a result of the organization upgrading to smart technology, smart technology-enabled fueling and payment options, which we have undertaken in order to offer increased customer convenience and safety in light of the impact from COVID-19. That's one of the factors. The second one was roughly $23 million. This is staff restructuring cost. The full amount was booked in the third quarter of 2020. As part of our OpEx optimization initiative, we booked nonrecurring staff restructuring costs, which of course leads us to a higher operating expenditure. Now we expect benefits of this restructuring to be visible going forward. This should lead to a meaningful reduction in our staff costs. This, of course, remains a major [ operating practice ]
Continuing on the material one-offs, there were USD 19 million that we provisioned on trade receivables in light of the current environment, which places an undue amount of pressure on some of our customers. So in light of that, we booked about USD 19 million in total, of which USD 1.7 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition to that, we've got about [ $52 million ] (sic) [ USD 52 million ] of other one-offs, of which about USD 2.9 million was booked in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now these included additional pension cost contribution that we need to make on behalf of our employees, business transformation cost, as well as COVID-19 related expenses.
Moving on to the underlying EBITDA, which we define as EBITDA, which excludes gains or losses in inventory as well as one-off remain strong. So the underlying EBITDA demonstrated growth of 31.6% in 2020. And fourth quarter alone was 51.6% higher compared to the same period last year. So the growth was driven by higher fuel retail margins, of course, but also supported by like-for-like OpEx savings. The 2020 net profit is USD 662 million. This is a 9.7% increase when compared to 2019. Besides the higher EBITDA, this was offset by higher depreciation as well as lower interest income.
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for 2020. In 2020, our total fuel volumes decreased by 10.5% year-on-year. This was mainly due to an impact of COVID-19 that started hitting us in March 2020. Retail fuel volumes declined by 11.8% in 2020, compared to the same period last year. On the commercial side, the fuel volumes decreased by 8% year-on-year. Total fuel volume for the fourth quarter of the year increased by 2.3% compared to Q3 2020. Retail fuel volumes increased by 1.6% as compared to the prior quarter, but still remain 8.3% below fourth quarter 2019. Now this is impacted by ongoing Abu Dhabi border restrictions, many organizations continuing to allow remote working as well as schools remaining closed or not consistently open while the challenges from COVID-19 continue to impact the economy.
On the commercial fuel side, our commercial fuel volumes were down in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 5.2% year-on-year. This, of course, was mainly driven by a lower uplift from our strategic aviation customers. These are government customers. On the nonfuel business, our nonfuel transactions decreased by 33.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to COVID-19 led decline in customer visits. That was one factor. Compared to 2019, another factor was the absence of vouchers that we used to give out when customers paid AED 10 for assisted fueling. That of course ended in November 2019. So the bulk of 2020, what we're seeing is lower customer visits into the store, once again due to the impact from COVID-19 as well as what we think is the absence of vouchers.
However, the average gross basket size has seen growth and increased by 18.8% year-on-year in 2020. We believe this is driven by changing consumer shopping pattern during the pandemic. So the customers are visiting us less frequently, but when they do, they buy more during each visit. This was also supported by our customer-centric initiative, like improvement in category management as well as convenient features like online delivery.
Let's move on to gross profit performance by sector. The 2020 gross profit increased by 16.2%, driven by: one, the retail segment gross profit, which increased by 28.3% year-on-year. This was driven by the fuel retail business, which posted strong operating performance with gross profit growth of about 38.4% year-on-year. This was, of course, was on the back of higher retail fuel margins as the retail pump prices, what I mentioned earlier, did not fully fall in line with the crude oil prices as well as the refined product pricing impact as well as due to the reduction in fuel costs following the renegotiation of our fuel supply contract, which was effective from November 2019, when we ended Flex.
On the nonfuel retail gross profit side, this was impacted by lower transactions as a result of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and as I mentioned a few moments ago, due to the absence of voucher redemption after implementing free assisted fueling.
On the commercial business side, the gross profit was negatively impacted due to lower volumes and one-off, whereas 2019 included one-off recovery.
Moving downward, segment-wise EBITDA performance. As I mentioned before, our 2020 EBITDA increased by 12.3%, despite the $146 million of one-off expenses that I discussed a few moments ago. The retail EBITDA increased on the back of higher retail margins offset, however, by lower fuel volume, decline in nonfuel profit as well as the increase in the one-off OpEx.
Our 2020 commercial EBITDA declined, once again, due to lower volumes and other one-offs. On the flip side, in 2019, on the commercial side, the 2019 EBITDA included one-off recovery and reversals. The unallocated EBITDA, as you can see on the slide [Technical Difficulty] the CWIP write-off, as covered earlier.
Moving on to the OpEx update. If we look to our operating expenses, the total OpEx increased in 2020 by [Technical Difficulty]. This was mainly due to one-off expenses as it relates to staff restructuring costs; additional pension cost contribution, which we have to make on behalf of our employees; expenses that we could not have planned for because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related complexities; OpEx related to growth, which, of course, is directly affiliated with our network expansion as we expand the network, the OpEx continues to grow; as well as the cost of additional staff, given that we have now, since November 2019, ended Flex, and we offer free assisted fueling to all our customers, free of charge price. 
Having said that, however, we had seen good momentum in cost optimization initiatives in 2020. We've accelerated, and we are on good track, and the benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken throughout the year are now visible with like-for-like OpEx savings of $15 million year-on-year in 2020 after the company -- the organization achieved USD 100 million over 2018 and 2019. This further reduction is mainly as a result of optimization in staff costs as well as decrease in general and admin expenses.
While we -- as an organization, while we have been diligently focused on the nature of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the safety and the well-being of our staff and customers, the transformation effort that we have initiated in 2020, we have discussed with the market, we'll continue to ensure that the operating costs are market competitive, and ADNOC Distribution remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth ambitions.
Looking at the cash position. So looking at the cash generation, we generated free cash flow of USD 195 million in 2020, driven by strong cash flow operations of course. And our cash position reduced in 2020 compared to end of 2019 due to negative working capital movements, higher capital expenditure and, of course, the dividend payments. In line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we have spent a higher amount of capital expenditure, totaling up to USD 266 million in 2020. Now this is approximately twice the amount we spent in 2019. So 80% of our capital expenditure is growth oriented. This is of course driven by the higher number of new stations that we continue to build and open.
On the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio side, as of December 31, 2020, this ratio was 0.85. This is an increase from 0.26 at December 31, 2019. But of course, we remain well below 2x as for our commitment.
So at this point, let me hand it back over to the Athmane to summarize our 2021 outlook. Over to you, Athmane."

So allow me to update you now on the outlook and the strategic priorities for this year. After a strong financial performance in 2020 and accelerated delivery of our strategic growth plan, we expect the momentum to sustain in 2021, driven by, first of all, the delivery of 70 to 80 new stations across our domestic and international network. Of these, 30 to 35 new stations are expected in the UAE, of which 12 to 18 in Dubai. In Saudi Arabia, we expect to add 40 to -- sorry, to 45 new stations, of which 35 are already announced through acquisitions, and we expect, therefore, 5 to 10 organic build out to be completed in 2021.
Our guidance does not include potential new M&A opportunities we are currently evaluating. Secondly, our -- we expect fuel volumes to grow compared to 2021, driven by progressive recovery as vaccine roll out allowed ease in mobility restrictions and also driven by the contribution from significantly higher number of new stations delivered in Dubai in 2020 and expected volumes from Saudi Arabia.
Third, in our nonfuel business, we expect to refurbish 40 to 60 more C-stores this year, in line with our target to refurbish our entire store C-store network by 2022-2023.
Four, after making a significant progress in our OpEx optimization initiative in 2020, we remain committed to achieve further operational excellence and pursue incremental savings of around $25 million in 2021 and around $85 million over 2021, 2023. So our guidance remains unchanged.
So in 2021, finally, we expect CapEx of around $250 million to $300 million, reiterating our commitment to deliver smart growth and offer best-in-class services to our customers. 
This -- we will now end the presentation, and we are open to any questions. The only thing I wanted to add, sorry, is that we remain confident that we will deliver our long-term strategic commitment to reach at least $1 billion EBITDA target by 2023. We are also confident to sustain attractive dividend returns by strong balance sheet and confidence in our cash flow generation capability, while retaining sufficient cash to support the growth in both domestic and international markets. So this concludes today's presentation. We are happy now to take any questions you may have. Thank you."

So can you give us some guidance around how much that number could be? And finally, I just wanted to understand on your fuel retail margins, you obviously saw very high margins this year, all inventory around AED 0.70 to AED 0.75 per liter versus AED 0.40 or AED 0.45 that you saw over the last 2 years. So how should we be thinking of fuel retail margins going into 2021?"

So I'm going to start with the volume expectations and volume guidance. What we can tell you is, first of all, that in the month of Jan 2021, the trend in fuel volumes is broadly similar to Q4 2020, i.e., down 8% to 10% compared to last year. So it's difficult to provide specific guidance for 2021 at this stage given ongoing uncertainties regarding movement restrictions, and you are aware of the restrictions within the UAE. However, we are anticipating our fuel volumes to grow compared to 2020, particularly led by progressive recovery towards the second half of this year. So we will update the market when the situation will be normal, and we will have no longer restrictions in movements. Can you just repeat again your second question, sorry?"

Now if you look at ADNOC Distribution, what changes when we acquire, when we complete the acquisitions, the margin that these stations enjoy at present, that is SAR 0.09. What happens when we complete acquisition ADNOC Distribution, the margin will go up to SAR 0.15 for gasoline and from SAR 0.035 to SAR 0.05 for diesel.

In 2020, like similar to 95% of regulated market, the situation that we have witnessed in the UAE is that the new shop inventory has kept some prices stable. These have allowed the players, a few retail players, to be able to provide 100% services during the COVID pandemic situation. And we have been open 24 hours around the clock, making sure that we provide the necessary support to the economy. So going forward, so these kind of -- this kind of margin for 2020 are exceptional.

Is that the case? Because it seems that you kind of like paid a bit more for this site you bought yesterday.
And then how should I be thinking about your EBITDA per site? It looks like now it's something like $100,000 to $200,000 per year EBITDA per site. But should I assume that with the uplift in margins, it could go to $250,000 per site. That's the first question. 
And second question is with regard to the dividend. Congratulations on, I mean, making a bit more firm for the next couple of years. I'm just trying to understand the sense of what kind of EBITDA level would you be targeting? Are you going talking about increase to that dividend. So for example, would you be making an increase to the dividend at maybe $1.1 billion EBITDA? Because I think even if you do reach like $1 billion of EBITDA, it doesn't necessarily mean that this would translate to a materially high dividend. And then the last question is on India. Can you give us an update on what's going on with that LPG expansion you're trying to do there?"

Just, I'm sorry, I could just answer very quickly, and I'll give the floor to Mohamed Al Hashemi. I guess, look, the differential in the transaction multiples, which are anyway very attractive, I guess that's what I need just to highlight here. If you look at the EBITDA multiple that we have acquired these stations, it's roughly between, I would say, close to 6x EBITDA, which is a great achievement that we -- that our many teams have been able to reach today. 
If you look at the potential value creation on the top of this, if you look at 31 stations, which is more than 85% of these stations in part at the moment, the kind of margins that uplift -- that our CFO was mentioning earlier. So there is clearly an upside for the story. And if you look just at the Saudi players, listed in Saudi, you're going to see that the EBITDA is above 10x. So clearly, there is hidden value that we're going to crystallize through these acquisitions. 
Second part of the answer regarding the Saudi acquisition. The valuation reflects the EBITDA contribution, and some of the new stations we acquired with the second transactions are large stations with high throughput and are also qualified for higher fuel margin. So this is the answer. 
Mohamed, if you want to add anything? If not, we can go to the second question. Up to you?"

As far as what we're expecting to see, we were ready to dispose the gross profit on these 31 stations. The uplift should be between 43% to 67%, depending on the fuel mix. For EBITDA of $3 million in 2019, once we complete the acquisition, we expect that to go up. How much? Well, we can tell you the gross profit between 43% to 67%. 
Now the other 4 stations, we're ready to disclose a bit more bottom level detail there. The 4 stations that we've also acquired, taking us to a total of 35. 3 have been opened in December of 2020; 1 opened in the first quarter of this year, not long at all -- not long ago.

I'll go ahead and press one of them. The current state of fuel pricing in UAE. 
So the question is, has it reverted back to the pre-COVID mechanism of market pricing, and should we expect to like-for-like fuel margins to be lower for 2021? 
I think that's a good question. And the answer to that is, at present, we have not reverted back to pre-COVID mechanism. There is a floor support offered by the Ministry of Energy. This, of course, commenced last year, and that is there in place as we see for the month of February. Now when it's going to end? We do not have any visibility. But presumably, should end sometime rather sooner than later.
Of course, once it ends, we should expect the like-for-like fuel margin to be lower and revert back to the margin guarantee that's in place for 2021.
Another question that I'm seeing is the new stations that we acquired recently, higher valuation than the 15 stations in the Eastern province. The valuations have been set based on throughput, based on size of the station and based on, of course, the hurdle rate that we expect -- the returns that we expect from these stations. So based on that, that's how we're setting the valuation of these new stations that we're acquiring in Saudi. Of course, evaluation is reflective of the EBITDA contribution. What you see in the second transaction, higher valuation means that these are larger stations, higher throughput. And of course, it looks like the other stations are also qualified for the higher fuel margin."

We will then discuss in detail our growth strategy and the financial performance. 
We'll then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation. Can you just move to the next slide, please, guys. Thank you. So just -- yes, thank you. Just before we begin, please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements. This presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in other investor communications, all of which are available on our website. 
I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information. I will start with brief summary of ADNOC Distribution, key achievements in Q1 2021 and the progress we have made in context of our 2021 outlook and growth strategy. Our CEO and CFO would provide further insights on our strategy and financial performance. 
Q1 2021 has been another solid quarter for ADNOC Distribution, demonstrating resilient business performance and continued delivery on smart growth strategy. The company's fuel volume continued to show progressive recovery compared to pre coved levels, i.e., versus 2019 . Q1 2021 total fuel volumes decreased by 4.9% compared to Q1 2019, while Q4 2020, total fuel volumes were down by 7.3% versus Q4 2019. 
This gradual recovery is driven by improved consumer sentiment following government vaccination rollout program, incremental volumes from our Dubai stations and proactive sales strategy in our operating. Sorry, we are hearing some music. 
[Technical Difficulty] 
Thank you. So subsequently, Q1 2021 underlying EBITDA grew by 17.5% year-on-year, driven by growth initiatives such as Dubai expansion, proactive sales strategy to increase corporate fuel volume and improved margins across business units and reduction in OpEx. Despite growth in our network, our total OpEx declined in Q1 2021, and the companies recognized like-for-like OpEx savings of $10 million in the first quarter, putting us in a strong presentation to achieve a $25 million like-for-like OpEx savings in 2021. This is our guidance. 
We continued to deliver on our strategic growth plans in the first quarter. Our key priority in the UAE remains expansion in Dubai, where we are gaining incremental volumes and EBITDA, and we remain on track to open 30 to 35 stations in the UAE, including 12 to 18 in Dubai. Our [indiscernible] store network has grown by around 23% versus Q1 of last year. In line with our ambitious nonfuel retail strategy and building on the momentum of last year, we republished 14 convenience stores in the first quarter to offer fresh layout and new food offering, thereby further enhancing shopping experience for our customers. 
We remain on track to refurbish 40 to 60 stores for 2021. In addition to our UAE expansion, we are progressing to expand internationally. We have good news on acquisitions we announced in December 2020, and our CEO will provide more updates when we will discuss our strategy. Once we close the 3 announced transactions to acquire 35 stations, our total network in Saudi Arabia will increase to 37 stations. 
Beyond this, we are in discussion with several players to further expand our presence in KSA, in line with our international growth strategy. Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns, underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high visibility of cash returns to our shareholders. 
For 2020, we paid dividend of $700 million, half of which was paid in October 2020, and the second half was paid in April 2021, taking full year dividend of 2 -- [ 20.57 ] per share. The company's 2021 dividend policy is set to continue with dividend of another $700 million, offering a 4.4% dividend yield. During the company's general assembly meeting in March, shareholders further proved amendment to dividend policy, setting minimum $700 million for 2022, thereby enhancing payback visibility until April 2023. 
For years thereafter, the dividend policy remains unchanged at minimum 75% of distributable profits. Amendment in dividend policy recognized the company's strong financial position, confidence in its growth prospects and cash flow generation ability going forward. And our CFO will dig into this. Finally, regarding ADNOC Distribution share trading activity, a key milestone of free float, doubling to 20%, was realized in September 2020. 
This has led to significant increase in trading activity of ADNOC Distribution shares on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange as you have witnessed. Also, and finally, we expect tomorrow, a key event for ADNOC Distribution shareholders. [indiscernible] could announce inclusion of ADNOC Distribution in its EM Index. In that case, it will further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors and awareness of ADNOC Distribution's unique value proposition. 
This would also attract foreign inflows in ADNOC Distribution shares, thereby further diversifying our shareholder base. I will now hand over to Ahmed for an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Ahmed."

Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Before I move on our growth strategy, allow me to reiterate our commitment to health and safety of our employees, customers and all stakeholders, which remains our key priority at all times. Supporting the nation's ongoing fight again COVID-19, ADNOC Distribution has ensured all health and safety measures are maintained -- and Q 2021, the company became the fairest fuel retailer in the world with 100% of its frontline staff working in our service station network now vaccinated. 
We will continue to strive to meet energy needs of our customers and communities in a sustainable and safe manner. To provide further color on our growth strategy, let me begin with our fuel business, which includes our Retail and commercial customers. Our fuel network has grown by 15% in Q1 2021 compared to Q1 2020. We maintained leading market position, in UAE's retail fuel network. And now operate 449 fuel stations in the UAE as of 33rd of March 2021. 
We also remain focused on value assertive and underpenetrated Dubai market. And as of April 2021, we opened 5 new stations in Dubai. As a result, the company's Dubai service station network has increased from 26 stations at the end of 2020 to 31 stations by end of April 2021. Dubai is delivering as per our plans with double-digit growth and fuel volumes sold in Q1 2021, driven by new station openings. And we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as full impact of our new station openings become visible in 2021. 
And as mobility restrictions are lifted further following vaccine rollout to wider population. We have also started to see growth materializing from management initiatives in our commercial business. We witnessed strong increase in bulk LPG sales volumes as well as profitability of LPG cylinders sold in Q1 2021. With the support of government authorities to enforce strict controls, share of gray market and LPG business, has reduced, thereby contributing to higher growth. 
Secondly, profitability in LPG cylinder business has increased following our decision to increase price of LPG cylinders last July. We continue to see a potential $20 million incremental EBITDA contribution from this initiative on a yearly basis as guided previously. Thirdly, our commercial sales team is more proactively managing dynamic pricing in order to grow our market share in gas oil fuels, sales through spot deals as well as bringing new corporate customers. 
This has also contributed to higher sales volumes and margins in our corporate business. Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we remain well positioned to harness international growth opportunities. Out of the total 35 stations acquisitions we announced so far in 3 different transactions, [indiscernible] of 15 stations has now received approval from the General Authority of Competition, GAC, and [indiscernible] Saudi Arab. While as the other 2 are currently under review by GAC. 
The next steps to close these transactions are to transfer all necessary licenses. Beyond these 35 stations, we are continuing to explore further opportunities to expand in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries and international markets. We will announce further updates at an appropriate time. Moving to our nonfuel retail business. 
We opened 6 new convenience stores and DOE in Q1 2021. Our network of 332 C-stores as of 31st of March 2021 has grown by 23% compared to same period end 2020. After strong momentum and the revitalization of our convenience stores in 2020 with refurbishment of 100 stores, pace of revitalization has continued in Q1 with refurbishment of 14 convenience stores. 
We aim to offer superior customer experience through various customer-centric initiatives such as modem and digitally enabled environment, improvement in category management, offering high margin, fresh food and premium coffee. On the back of these initiatives, average gross basket size sustained growth and increased by 2.2% year-on-year in Q1 2021. 
We also saw increase in margins at our C-stores with better product offerings. We also maintained our focus on providing an increased level of convenience to customers, particularly through our partnerships with delivery services, [indiscernible] and Carriage, which allow customers to order from more than 1,700 ADNOC Oasis products from over 100 convenience stores across the UAE. 
Finally, the company continued its drive to enhance its offering through ADNOC Rewards loyalty programs, the UAE's fairest customer loyalty program from a fuel provider. In the first quarter of 2021, we launched a new partnership with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms across exchange points and maximize benefits. We also added 27 new partners to the ADNOC Rewards program, offering members more deals and discounts from some of the UAE's leading leisure and entertainment brands. 
ADNOC Rewards has recorded more than 1 million registered users at the end of Q1 2021 and over 12 million transactions since the launch of the program. I will now hand over to Mohamed Al Hashimi to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Mohamed."

I'm just going to take you through our financial performance for the first quarter of the year. So as you can see on the slide in front of you, we've demonstrated strong financial as well as operational performance in Q1 2021. Our revenue decreased by approximately 13.3% year-on-year. This, of course, was driven by the lower fuel volumes as well as lower selling prices as a result of lower crude oil prices as well as a decline in the nonfuel revenues. 
But the operating performance has remained strong. Gross profit has increased by 19.4% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Now this growth was driven by the fuel retail and commercial segments, which we will elaborate in the next upcoming slides. So the Q1 2021 reported EBITDA of USD 222 million, increased by 46.8%. Now this was driven by an increase in corporate fuel volumes, as I just mentioned; higher retail and commercial margins; retail inventory gains of $29 million that we booked in Q1; lower operating costs, as the CEO mentioned; and lastly, one-off expenses lower, but one-off expenses of $9 million during the first quarter of this year. 
Now the same period last year, of course, was negatively impacted by a total of about $20 million in one-off items. Now the underlying EBITDA, as you've seen, which we calculate, excluding inventory gains and losses and any one-offs, this has remained strong with growth of 17.5% year-on-year. The underlying operational performance was driven by higher margins as well as a reduction in our operating expenditure. So the first quarter of this year, net profit was $172 million, which, of course, is an increase of almost 58% compared to the same period last year. 
This is, of course, resulting from a higher EBITDA. Let me just go to the next slide, please. Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. The total fuel volumes we've sold have continued to witness progressive recovery. Now this is, of course, compared to the pre-COVID-19 levels. However, the aggregate Q1 2021 fuel volumes are still down almost 4% year-on-year. And this is, of course, resulting from the ongoing mobility restrictions. 
Retail fuel volumes, which is approximately 68% of our total fuel sales during the first quarter, declined by almost 5%, 4.7% to be precise, compared to the same period last year. Now as we talked about the mobility restrictions, the Retail fuel volumes have been particularly impacted by the Abu Dhabi border restrictions as well as due to the fact that many of the organizations, both professional, government, schools, for instance, continue to allow remote working amidst the safety restrictions. 
This, of course, has an impact on the Retail fuel volumes. On the commercial side, fuel were down by 1.6% year-on-year. During the first quarter. Now this was mainly due to the lower sales on the strategic aviation customers, but also partially offset by the growth that we witnessed in the corporate fuel volume side. 
The corporate fuel volumes growth was driven by an increase in mostly gas oil sales. Now this was on the back of a proactive sales strategy, both to gain spot deals as well as increased [indiscernible] and government support in force regulations, tackling the gray market, especially in bulk LPG. As we look at the nonfuel business, the transactions have decreased by 17.5% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2021. But the good news there is that the transactions have increased by just a little over 5% compared to last quarter. 
So the sequential recovery is supported by an increase in the number of convenience stores, vehicle inspection centers. And both of these -- a focus of our expansion. In addition to improved product offerings at the stores, the refurbishment revitalization of our convenience stores, marketing and promotion campaigns, very targeted campaigns, under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program, and the objective is, of course, to attract higher footfall and increase customer spending. 
The average gross basket size, sustained growth increased by just a little over 2% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2021. We believe this was supported by our customer-centric initiatives, such as improvements in category management, ADNOC Rewards, our focus on that as well as the online delivery service. Now [indiscernible] start the Q1 2021. We've also started to see some margin improvement in our convenience store business. 
So if you look at gross profit margin in the first quarter, it's about 31.6% Q1 versus approximately 27% in Q1 last year. So 31.6% Q1 this year versus 26.9% last year, same period. Now moving on to the gross profit performance by segment. Our gross profit has increased by 19.4%, driven by retail and the commercial businesses. 
Now on the Retail side, the Retail segment gross profit increased by about 10% year-on-year, driven by the fuel retail business. Now this part of the business posted strong operating performance, gross profit growth of almost 13%, 12.6% year-on-year. This was on the back of higher margins because Retail fuel pump prices did not fall in line with the fuel supply cost for the month of January. Ministry of Energy support, in addition, to the inventory gains of $29 million. 
Both of these upsides were, of course, partially offset by the lower fuel volumes. On the nonfuel side, the Retail gross profit has decreased by about 4.4% year-on-year. Although the nonfuel revenues have declined by 13.2%, this, we believe, is supported by improvement in margins in the C-store business. The margins have improved, we believe, as a result of better product mix, introduction of high margin fresh foods and coffee [indiscernible] products and [indiscernible] our [indiscernible] footfall. 
On the commercial business side, the gross profit increased by 48.5% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher corporate volumes, higher margins, of course, offset by the lower aviation volumes. And if you look back to the same period last year, Q1 2020, this was negatively impacted by revaluation of inventory stock, following lower oil prices and other one-off items. Let's go onto segment-wise EBITDA performance. 
So as I mentioned before, the first quarter 2021 EBITDA increased by 46.8%. Once again, driven by higher retail and commercial fuel margin. However, I would also help this OpEx optimization, $10 million savings like-for-like, as we mentioned, whereas the first quarter of last year included negative one-offs of about $20 million. On the Retail EBITDA, this has increased on the back of higher margins, inventory gains as well as a reduction in OpEx. However, offset by the lower fuel volumes and decline in the nonfuel gross profit. 
On the commercial side, EBITA growth was driven by higher volumes, corporate volumes, higher margins, OpEx savings. And again, just similar to Retail, the first quarter of 2020 included negative one-offs. This didn't help at the time of price. Excluding inventory gains, losses and one-offs, the underlying EBITDA is up by 17.5% in the first quarter of the year. Let's go to the next slide, please. Okay. 
Let's have a look at our operating expenditure. As we've alluded to, throughout the presentation, our total OpEx has decreased by 3.8% year-on-year in first quarter 2021. Now once we have excluded depreciation, the OpEx has decreased by 6.5% year-on-year, demonstrating benefits that we have extracted for management initiatives, to optimize OpEx across all business units. 
We've talked about it, starting last year, especially when COVID struck us, that we're going to maintain continued pressure on operating expenditure and the results are starting to come through. So we remain committed to reducing operating expenditure, despite growth in the company's Retail network. As a result, now, during the first quarter, we've realized like-for-like OpEx savings of USD 10 million in the first quarter of the year, mainly due to optimization in staffing costs, which, of course, is a major driver in our total OpEx. 
Now we have been diligently focused on our response to COVID-19, ensuring the safety and well-being of our customers and our staff, but the transformation efforts will continue. We will continue to ensure that operating costs are market competitive, and the company remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth emissions. Last but not least, the cash generation or free cash flow generated for the quarter -- for the period was $227 million, of course, driven by strong cash flow from operations as well as some positive working capital movements. 
The positive working capital movement, mainly the result of increase in [indiscernible] parties, driven by higher fuel purchases, the value of the same fuel purchases in a rising oil price environment, higher trade payables, and of course, partially offset by increase in our inventories. In line with our guidance and our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent USD 65 million of capital expenditure in the first quarter of this year. 
We maintained our strong balance sheet at the end of March with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.93x. Of course, this is well below the 2x as for our commitment to the marketplace. Let me hand it back over to Athmane. Over to you, Athmane."

In a nutshell, after strong results in Q1, the company is well positioned to grow its earnings in line with our long-term strategic commitment to reach at least a $1 billion EBITDA target by 2023. So we remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner, deliver an enhanced customer experience, further optimize our operations to become a leading, cost efficient, fuel retailer and generate sustainable value creation for our shareholders. 
Our Dubai and Saudi expansion momentum is likely to sustain in 2021. In our convenience store business, around 60% of our C-store network that was operational at the end of 2019 would be refurbished by the end of this year. This will put us in a better position to reap the benefits of our initiatives that offer superior customer journey and in-store experience, coupled with high margin products. 
We are confident of achieving growth in our convenience stores business once economy recovers fully from the impact of pandemic. We are also confident to sustain attractive dividend payback backed by a strong balance sheet, as mentioned by Mohamed, and confidence in cash flow generation capability while retaining -- sorry, sufficient cash to support growth. 
This concludes today's presentation, and we are happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

So we continue to basically focus and beef up the pipeline even more. 
And as we've said in prior calls, during earlier quarters, this is not going to be one large acquisition. It's going to be many, many, many smaller acquisitions as we build up their prices there. So we're far from it. But as we've said, we hope and we're aspiring and certainly working to execute on this front that the KSA market, which is absolutely crucial for the growth of ADNOC Distribution continues to deliver, but it's going to do that once we get to that size, and that's not going to happen anytime soon.

And the second question I have is more on fuel Retail margins. I think in line with your guidance last year, we have seen few retail margins correcting versus the 0.65, 0.70 per liter that we saw in Q3 and Q4. I think it was closer to 0.53 per liter.

Yes, the volumes are not 100% recovering as expected after the rollover of the vaccination campaigns across the country. However, we remain cautious about the situation.

In terms of the margins, we don't have visibility about the Ministry of Economy if there will be a change in the margins. However, the clear message we received that we will continue now with the official fix margins regulated by the Ministry of Energy. I'm not sure Mohamed or Athmane would like to add more."

The mobility restrictions continue to go down, but we're now at the full stage of normalcy yet. The mobility restrictions are still in place, especially between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. So we're not completely out. As I mentioned, when we were covering the fuel volumes part, many organizations are still doing remote working. Schools continue to go on and off. So we were far from full normalcy, although much, much ahead of where we were during lockdowns, for instance. 
So do we expect to let the numbers -- or expect the numbers to continue to get better going forward? And the answer is yes. It's not going to happen overnight, and we'll be back to pre-COVID-19 levels just in a matter of weeks, probably not. But the good news is that we expect the numbers to get progressively better over the rest of the year. In terms of margin, as we said, when we finished out the 2020, we said we don't know when the extra support from the Ministry is going to end. 
Most likely at the end of January. And indeed, that's what has happened. The Ministry support has officially ended at the end of February. So everything that you see now is full exposure to the market movements, whether the oil prices go up or down. So as of March, we are without any support from the Ministry of Energy. That was, of course, there to help this sector during an extremely stressful time during the lockdowns. That has ended in going forward, we have 0 guidance. We have no guidance in terms of if and when we can expect more support from the Ministry. 
So our expectation for the remainder of the year is it's business as usual. It's business is normal. So if prices at the pump have gone up, it's purely a function of oil prices having gone up."

We'll then discuss in detail our growth strategy and the financial performance. We'll then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation. 
Can you just move to the next slide, please, guys. I cannot see the slides moving but -- thank you. So just -- yes, thank you. Just before we begin, please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements. This presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are detailed in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in other investor communications, all of which are available on our website. 
I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information. I will start with brief summary of ADNOC Distribution key achievements in Q1 2021 and the progress we have made in context of our 2021 outlook and growth strategy. Our CEO and CFO would provide further insights on our strategy and financial performance. 
Q1 2021 has been another solid quarter for ADNOC Distribution, demonstrating resilient business performance and continued delivery on smart growth strategy. The company's fuel volume continued to show progressive recovery compared to pre-COVID levels, i.e., versus 2019. Q1 2021 total fuel volumes decreased by 4.9% compared to Q1 2019, while Q4 2020 total fuel volumes were down by 7.3% versus Q4 2019. 
This gradual recovery is driven by improved consumer sentiment following government vaccination rollout program, incremental volumes from our Dubai stations and proactive sales strategy in our operating business. Sorry, we are hearing some music around.
[Technical Difficulty] 
Thank you. So subsequently, Q1 2021 underlying EBITDA grew by 17.5% year-on-year, driven by growth initiatives such as Dubai expansion, proactive sales strategy to increase corporate fuel volume and improved margins across business units and reduction in OpEx. Despite growth in our network, our total OpEx declined in Q1 2021, and the companies recognized like-for-like OpEx savings of $10 million in the first quarter, putting us in a strong position to achieve a $25 million like-for-like OpEx savings in 2021. This is our guidance. 
We continued to deliver on our strategic growth plans in the first quarter. Our key priority in the UAE remains expansion in Dubai, where we are gaining incremental volumes and EBITDA, and we remain on track to open 30 to 35 stations in the UAE, including 12 to 18 in Dubai. Our convenience store network has grown by around 23% versus Q1 of last year. In line with our ambitious nonfuel retail strategy and building on the momentum of last year, we refurbished 14 convenience stores in the first quarter to offer fresh layout and new food offering, thereby further enhancing shopping experience for our customers. 
We remain on track to refurbish 40 to 60 stores for 2021. In addition to our UAE expansion, we are progressing to expand internationally. We have good news on acquisitions we announced in December 2020, and our CEO will provide more updates when we will discuss our strategy. Once we close the 3 announced transactions to acquire 35 stations, our total network in Saudi Arabia will increase to 37 stations. 
Beyond this, we are in discussion with several players to further expand our presence in KSA, in line with our international growth strategy. Finally, we are committed to deliver attractive long-term shareholder returns, underpinned by our progressive dividend policy that offers high visibility of cash returns to our shareholders. 
For 2020, we paid dividend of $700 million, half of which was paid in October 2020, and the second half was paid in April 2021, taking full year dividend of -- to, sorry, $20.57 per share. The company's 2021 dividend policy is set to continue with dividend of another $700 million, offering a 4.4% dividend yield. During the company's general assembly meeting in March, shareholders further proved amendment to dividend policy, setting minimum $700 million for 2022, thereby enhancing payback visibility until April 2023. 
For years thereafter, the dividend policy remains unchanged at minimum 75% of distributable profits. Amendment in dividend policy recognized the company's strong financial position, confidence in its growth prospects and cash flow generation ability going forward, and our CFO will dig into this. Finally, regarding ADNOC Distribution share trading activity, a key milestone of free float, doubling to 20%, was realized in September 2020. This has led to significant increase in trading activity of ADNOC Distribution shares on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange as you have witnessed. 
Also, and finally, we expect tomorrow, a key event for ADNOC Distribution shareholders. MSCI could announce inclusion of ADNOC Distribution in its EM Index. In that case, it will further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors and awareness of ADNOC Distribution's unique value proposition. This would also attract foreign inflows in ADNOC Distribution shares, thereby further diversifying our shareholder base. 
I will now hand over to Ahmed for an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Ahmed."

Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. 
Before I move on our growth strategy, allow me to reiterate our commitment to health and safety of our employees, customers and all stakeholders, which remains our key priority at all times. Supporting the nation's ongoing fight again COVID-19, ADNOC Distribution has ensured all health and safety measures are maintained -- and Q 2021, the company became the fairest fuel retailer in the world with 100% of its frontline staff working in our service station network now vaccinated. 
We will continue to strive to meet energy needs of our customers and communities in a sustainable and safe manner. To provide further color on our growth strategy, let me begin with our fuel business, which includes our retail and commercial customers. Our fuel network has grown by 15% in Q1 2021 compared to Q1 2020. We maintained leading market position, in UAE's retail fuel network. And now operate 449 fuel stations in the UAE as of 33rd of March 2021. 
We also remain focused on value assertive and underpenetrated Dubai market. And as of April 2021, we opened 5 new stations in Dubai. As a result, the company's Dubai service station network has increased from 26 stations at the end of 2020 to 31 stations by end of April 2021. Dubai is delivering as per our plans with double-digit growth and fuel volumes sold in Q1 2021, driven by new station openings. And we expect our Dubai expansion to contribute meaningfully going forward as full impact of our new station openings become visible in 2021 and as mobility restrictions are lifted further following vaccine rollout to wider population. 
We have also started to see growth materializing from management initiatives in our commercial business. We witnessed strong increase in bulk LPG sales volumes as well as profitability of LPG cylinders sold in Q1 2021. With the support of government authorities to enforce strict controls, share of gray market and LPG business, has reduced, thereby contributing to higher growth. 
Secondly, profitability in LPG cylinder business has increased following our decision to increase price of LPG cylinders last July. We continue to see a potential $20 million incremental EBITDA contribution from this initiative on a yearly basis as guided previously. Thirdly, our commercial sales team is more proactively managing dynamic pricing in order to grow our market share in gas oil fuels sales through spot deals as well as bringing new corporate customers. This has also contributed to higher sales volumes and margins in our corporate business. 
Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy, and we remain well positioned to harness international growth opportunities. Out of the total 35 stations acquisitions we announced so far in 3 different transactions, [indiscernible] one of 15 stations has now received approval from the General Authority of Competition, GAC, and the [ Canton ] Saudi Arabia. While as the other 2 are currently under review by GAC. 
The next steps to close these transactions are to transfer all necessary licenses. Beyond these 35 stations, we are continuing to explore further opportunities to expand in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries and international markets. We will announce further updates at an appropriate time. 
Moving to our nonfuel retail business. We opened 6 new convenience stores and DOE in Q1 2021. Our network of 332 C-stores as of 31st of March 2021 has grown by 23% compared to same period end 2020. After strong momentum and the revitalization of our convenience stores in 2020 with refurbishment of 100 stores, pace of revitalization has continued in Q1 with refurbishment of 14 convenience stores. 
We aim to offer superior customer experience through various customer-centric initiatives such as modem and digitally enabled environment, improvement in category management, offering high margin, fresh food and premium coffee. On the back of these initiatives, average gross basket size sustained growth and increased by 2.2% year-on-year in Q1 2021. 
We also saw increase in margins at our C-stores following better product offerings. We also maintained our focus on providing an increased level of convenience to customers, particularly through our partnerships with delivery services, Talabat and Carriage, which allow customers to order from more than 1,700 ADNOC Oasis products from over 100 convenience stores across the UAE. 
Finally, the company continued its drive to enhance its offering through ADNOC Rewards loyalty programs, the UAE's fairest customer loyalty program from a fuel provider. In the first quarter of 2021, we launched a new partnership with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms to cross exchange points and maximize benefits. We also added 27 new partners to the ADNOC Rewards program, offering members more deals and discounts from some of the UAE's leading leisure and entertainment brands. ADNOC Rewards has recorded more than 1 million registered users at the end of Q1 2021 and over 12 million transactions since the launch of the program. 
I will now hand over to Mohamed Al Hashimi to present the highlights of our financial performance. Over to you, Mohamed."

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm just going to take you through our financial performance for the first quarter of the year. So as you can see on the slide in front of you, we've demonstrated strong financial as well as op",1530,"Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm just going to take you through our financial performance for the first quarter of the year. So as you can see on the slide in front of you, we've demonstrated strong financial as well as operational performance in Q1 2021. Our revenue decreased by approximately 13.3% year-on-year. This, of course, was driven by the lower fuel volumes as well as lower selling prices as a result of lower crude oil prices as well as a decline in the nonfuel revenues. 
But the operating performance has remained strong. Gross profit has increased by 19.4% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Now this growth was driven by the fuel retail and commercial segments, which we will elaborate in the next upcoming slides. 
So the Q1 2021 reported EBITDA of USD 222 million, increased by 46.8%. Now this was driven by an increase in corporate fuel volumes, as I just mentioned; higher retail and commercial margins; retail inventory gains of $29 million that we booked in Q1; lower operating costs, as the CEO mentioned; and lastly, one-off expenses, lower, but one-off expenses of $9 million during the first quarter of this year. 
Now the same period last year, of course, was negatively impacted by a total of about $20 million in one-off items. Now the underlying EBITDA, as you've seen, which we calculate, excluding inventory gains and losses and any one-offs, this has remained strong with growth of 17.5% year-on-year. The underlying operational performance was driven by higher margins as well as a reduction in our operating expenditure. So the first quarter of this year, net profit was $172 million, which, of course, is an increase of almost 58% compared to the same period last year. This is, of course, resulting from a higher EBITDA. 
Let me just go on to the next slide, please. Thank you. 
Now let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the first quarter. The total fuel volumes we've sold have continued to witness progressive recovery. Now this is, of course, compared to the pre-COVID-19 levels. However, the aggregate Q1 2021 fuel volumes are still down almost 4% year-on-year. And this is, of course, resulting from the ongoing mobility restrictions. 
Retail fuel volumes, which is approximately 68% of our total fuel sales during the first quarter, declined by almost 5%, 4.7% to be precise, compared to the same period last year. Now as we talked about the mobility restrictions, the retail fuel volumes have been particularly impacted by the Abu Dhabi border restrictions as well as due to the fact that many of the organizations, both professional, government, schools, for instance, continue to allow remote working amidst the safety restrictions. This, of course, has an impact on the retail fuel volumes. 
On the commercial side, fuel were down by 1.6% year-on-year during the first quarter. Now this was mainly due to the lower sales on the strategic aviation customers, but also partially offset by the growth that we witnessed in the corporate fuel volume side. The corporate fuel volumes growth was driven by an increase in mostly gas oil sales.
Now this was on the back of a proactive sales strategy, both to gain spot deals as well as increased scrutiny and government support in forced regulations, tackling the gray market, especially in bulk LPG. As we look at the nonfuel business, the transactions have decreased by 17.5% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2021. But the good news there is that the transactions have increased by just a little over 5% compared to last quarter. 
So the sequential recovery is supported by an increase in the number of convenience stores, vehicle inspection centers. And both of these -- a focus of our expansion. In addition to improved product offerings at the stores, the refurbishment revitalization of our convenience stores, marketing and promotion campaigns, very targeted campaigns, under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program, and the objective is, of course, to attract higher footfall and increase customer spending. 
The average gross basket size, sustained growth increased by just a little over 2% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2021. We believe this was supported by our customer-centric initiatives, such as improvements in category management, ADNOC Rewards, our focus on that as well as the online delivery service. 
Now starting the Q1 2021, we've also started to see some margin improvement in our convenience store business. So if you look at gross profit margin in the first quarter, it's about 31.6% Q1 versus approximately 27% in Q1 last year. So 31.6% Q1 this year versus 26.9% last year, same period. 
Now moving on to the gross profit performance by segment. Our gross profit has increased by 19.4%, driven by retail and the commercial businesses. 
Now on the retail side, the Retail segment gross profit increased by about 10% year-on-year, driven by the fuel retail business. Now this part of the business posted strong operating performance, gross profit growth of almost 13%, 12.6% year-on-year. This was on the back of higher margins because retail fuel pump prices did not fall in line with the fuel supply cost for the month of January. Ministry of Energy support, in addition, to the inventory gains of $29 million. Both of these upsides were, of course, partially offset by the lower fuel volumes. 
On the nonfuel side, the Retail gross profit has decreased by about 4.4% year-on-year. Although the nonfuel revenues have declined by 13.2%, this, we believe, is supported by improvement in margins in the C-store business. The margins have improved, we believe, as a result of better product mix, introduction of high margin fresh foods and coffee products and [indiscernible] our [indiscernible] entire footfall. 
On the commercial business side, the gross profit increased by 48.5% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher corporate volumes, higher margins, of course, offset by the lower aviation volumes. And if you look back to the same period last year, Q1 2020, this was negatively impacted by revaluation of inventory stock, following lower oil prices and other one-off items. 
Let's go onto segment-wise EBITDA performance. So as I mentioned before, the first quarter 2021 EBITDA increased by 46.8%. Once again, driven by higher retail and commercial fuel margin. However, I would also help this OpEx optimization, $10 million savings like-for-like, as we mentioned, whereas the first quarter of last year included negative one-offs of about $20 million. On the retail EBITDA, this has increased on the back of higher margins, inventory gains as well as a reduction in OpEx, however, offset by the lower fuel volumes and decline in the nonfuel gross profit. 
On the commercial side, EBITDA growth was driven by higher volumes, corporate volumes, higher margins, OpEx savings, and again, just similar to retail, the first quarter of 2020 included negative one-offs. This didn't help at the time, of course. Excluding inventory gains, losses and one-offs, the underlying EBITDA is up by 17.5% in the first quarter of the year. 
Let's go to the next slide, please. Okay. 
Let's have a look at our operating expenditure. As we've alluded to, throughout the presentation, our total OpEx has decreased by 3.8% year-on-year in first quarter 2021. Now once we have excluded depreciation, the OpEx has decreased by 6.5% year-on-year, demonstrating benefits that we have extracted for management initiatives, to optimize OpEx across all business units. 
We've talked about it, starting last year, especially when COVID struck us, that we're going to maintain continued pressure on operating expenditure and the results are starting to come through. So we remain committed to reducing operating expenditure, despite growth in the company's retail network. As a result, now, during the first quarter, we've realized like-for-like OpEx savings of USD 10 million in the first quarter of the year, mainly due to optimization in staffing costs, which, of course, is a major driver in our total OpEx. 
Now we have been diligently focused on our response to COVID-19, ensuring the safety and well-being of our customers and our staff, but the transformation efforts will continue. We will continue to ensure that operating costs are market competitive, and the company remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth emissions. 
Last but not least, the cash generation or free cash flow generated for the quarter -- for the period was $227 million, of course, driven by strong cash flow from operations as well as some positive working capital movements. The positive working capital movement, mainly the result of increase in [indiscernible] related parties, driven by higher fuel purchases, higher value of the same fuel purchases in a rising oil price environment, higher trade payables, and of course, partially offset by increase in our inventories. 
In line with our guidance and our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent USD 65 million of capital expenditure in the first quarter of this year. We maintained our strong balance sheet at the end of March with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.93x. Of course, this is well below the 2x as for our commitment to the marketplace. 
Let me hand it back over to Athmane. Over to you, Athmane."

So I discussed our 2021 key strategic targets at the beginning of our presentation, which are summarized on this slide. 
In a nutshell, after strong results in Q1, the company is well positioned to grow its earnings in line with our long-term strategic commitment to reach at least $1 billion EBITDA target by 2023. So we remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner, deliver an enhanced customer experience, further optimize our operations to become a leading, cost efficient, fuel retailer and generate sustainable value creation for our shareholders. 
Our Dubai and Saudi expansion momentum is likely to sustain in 2021. In our convenience store business, around 60% of our C-store network that was operational at the end of 2019 would be refurbished by the end of this year. This will put us in a better position to reap the benefits of our initiatives that offer superior customer journey and in-store experience, coupled with high-margin products. 
We are confident of achieving growth in our convenience stores business once economy recovers fully from the impact of pandemic. We are also confident to sustain attractive dividend payback backed by a strong balance sheet, as mentioned by Mohamed, and confidence in cash flow generation capability while retaining sufficient cash to support growth. 
This concludes today's presentation, and we are happy to take any questions that you may have. Thank you."

So we continue to basically focus and beef up the pipeline even more. 
And as we've said in prior calls, during earlier quarters, this is not going to be one large acquisition. It's going to be many, many, many smaller acquisitions as we build up their prices there. So we're far from it. But as we've said, we hope, and we're aspiring and certainly working to execute on this front, that the KSA market, which is absolutely crucial for the growth of ADNOC Distribution continues to deliver, but it's going to do that once we get to that size, and that's not going to happen anytime soon.

And the second question I have is more on fuel retail margins. I think in line with your guidance last year, we have seen fuel retail margins correcting versus the $0.65, $0.70 per liter that we saw in Q3 and Q4. I think it was closer to $0.53 per liter. I did notice that the fuel retail pump prices are up in March -- sorry, in April and May again. At the same time, oil prices are up as well.

The mobility restrictions continue to go down, but we're now at the full stage of normalcy yet. The mobility restrictions are still in place, especially between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. So we're not completely out. As I mentioned, when we were covering the fuel volumes part, many organizations are still doing remote working. Schools continue to go on and off. So we were far from full normalcy, although much, much, much ahead of where we were during lockdowns, for instance. 
So do we expect to let the numbers -- or expect the numbers to continue to get better going forward? And the answer is yes. It's not going to happen overnight, and we'll be back to pre-COVID-19 levels just in a matter of weeks, probably not. But the good news is that we expect the numbers to get progressively better over the rest of the year. 
In terms of margin, as we said, when we finished out the 2020, we said we don't know when the extra support from the Ministry is going to end. Most likely at the end of January. And indeed, that's what has happened. The Ministry support has officially ended at the end of February. So everything that you see now is full exposure to the market movements, whether the oil prices go up or down. 
So as of March, we are without any support from the Ministry of Energy. That was, of course, there to help this sector during an extremely stressful time during the lockdowns. That has ended, and going forward, we have zero guidance. We have no guidance in terms of if and when we can expect more support from the Ministry. 
So our expectation for the remainder of the year is it's business as usual. It's business as normal. So if prices at the pump have gone up, it's purely a function of oil prices having gone up. Okay?"

So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ADNOC Distribution conference call for the second quarter and half year 2021 results. I have with me Bader Lamki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mohamed Al Hashimi, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge that we experienced a technical issue at the beginning of the trading session this morning. So we worked quickly with the ADX to resolve this within 90 minutes and to minimize any disruption and inconvenience. 
Moving on to today's call, we will take you through the key highlights of H1 2021 and outlook. We will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update and financial performance. We will then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation. 
Before we begin, please, next slide, please. So before we begin, please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. This presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are deferred in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information. 
So I would like to provide you with a summary of the company's key achievements in H1 2021, and the progress we have made in delivering on our 2021 macro strategy. Our CEO and CFO will provide further insight on our strategy and financial performance. ADNOC Distribution continues to offer an attractive value proposition with the combination of a resilient business model, growth potential and a highly visible and predictable dividend policy. 
In H1 2021, the company delivered a strong financial performance, demonstrating its resilient and agile business model and the progress being made in delivering on its smart growth strategy. 
Let me begin with business resilience. The company's fuel volumes continue to see progressive recovery towards pre-COVID levels with 96% volume recovery in Q2 and H1 2021 compared to 90% recovery at the end 2020. This gradual recovery is an indication of improving consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE. In addition, we continue to see incremental volumes from our Dubai stations together with a proactive set strategy in our corporate business. Despite ongoing expansion in H1 2021, the company already realized around 70% of its 2021 targeted like-for-like OpEx savings of $25 million. 
In terms of smart growth now. In H1 2021, we continue to bid on our 2020 momentum and made significant progress on our domestic and international expansion. The company remains on track to deliver on its 2021 growth targets to open 30 to 35 stations in the UAE, including 12 to 18 locations in Dubai and 40 to 45 patients in Saudi Arabia. 
We also continue to deliver on our promise to bring modern digitally enabled retail convenience for customers and communities. In line with our ambitious nonfuel retail strategy, we refurbished 24 convenience stores in the first half of the year to offer fresh store layout and new food offerings, further enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish a total of 40 to 60 stores. 
Finally, ADNOC Distribution offers attractive long-term returns to shareholders, underpinned by its progressive dividend policy that offers high visibility of cash returns. So the dividend policy approved by our Board and shareholders recognize the company's strong financial position and demonstrates their confidence in growth prospects and cash flow generation ability going forward. 
The dividend policy set 2021 dividend at $700 million, offering 4.7% yield. We expect to pay $350 million cash dividend for the first half of 2021 in October 2021 and subject to the Board's approval. For 2022, dividend is set at minimum $700 million. And for years thereafter, dividend is set at a minimum 75% of distributable profits. These dividend payments are again subject to the approval by the Board and shareholders. 
I would also take this opportunity to highlight that ADNOC, who is a major shareholder of ADNOC Distribution, has successfully placed 10% of the company's share capital in September 2020, doubling free float to 20%. More recently, in May 2021, ADNOC placed additional 3% of the company's share capital increasing free flow further to 23%. This has allowed a significant increase in trading liquidity of ADNOC Distribution shares on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. Following the higher free float and trading liquidity, ADNOC Distribution shares were included in the MSCI EM in May 2021, and we expect a [indiscernible] milestone in the coming months with a potential FTSE EM inclusion in September 2021. This will further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into ADNOC Distribution shares. 
I will now hand over to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update of our growth strategy. Bader, over to you, please."

I'm delighted today to be speaking with you as I marked close to 100 days in my role as a CEO of ADNOC Distribution. For those who don't know my background, my expertise is in the oil and gas sector, clean energy and utility sector. And most recently, I had been the CEO of the National Central Cooling Company, Tabreed, which is a publicly listed company in the DFM. Since its IPO in 2017, ADNOC Distribution has been on a journey. Our consumer transformation as a leading retail company ensures we have a clear focus on profitable growth and capital discipline. I'm pleased to share with you that we'll continue to accelerate delivery of our growth plans and transform the fuel stations experience into a modern retail destination, which offers comprehensive fuel and nonfuel services for all our customers. While we will continue to meet energy needs of our customers and communities, we must do so sustainably and make our business more resilient and lead the UAE and the world energy transition towards a low carbon future. 
Our digital transformation strategy and IT modernization remains a key enabler. A key enabler for us to continue increasing efficiency and optimizing our resources. In Q2, we completed the successful upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system to -- which will further strengthen our operational efficiencies and processes. We have a very promising future with significant opportunities ahead. 
Today, I want to run with you our further progress -- update you on the further progress of our growth strategy. I think before I do so, I would like first to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our employees, customers and all stakeholders, which remains our key priorities at all times. Supporting the nation's ongoing fight against CoVID-19, ADNOC Distribution has assured that all health and safety measures are maintained. And in H1 2021, the company became the first fuel retail in the world with 100% of its frontline staff to be vaccinated, something that we're extremely proud of. It's an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to the nation's recovery from this pandemic. 
Coming back to our strategy. I'll begin first by outlining the key pillars for growth starting with our fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. With the addition of 12 new stations in H1 2021, our fuel network has grown by 13% and compared to H1 in 2020. We maintain a leading marketing position in the UAE in the retail fuel network. And now we are operating proudly 457 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of June of this year. We remain focused on adding value for both customers and shareholders. And the underpenetrated Dubai market is an integral part of this. 
In the first half of this year, we opened 5 new stations in Dubai, which means our stations network NBM rate has increased from 26 service station at the end of 2020 to 31 stations by the end of June 2021. We are continuing to gain market share in Dubai, a key market of growth with high double-digit growth fuel volume driven by new station operating. 
We have seen growth materializing from management initiatives in our commercial business. What I can share in this regard, we have seen an increase in sales in the bulk LPG, supported by strict enforcement by government authorities to control gray market activities. Secondly, profitability of our LPG cylinder business has also increased following last year's decision to increase the prices of LPG cylinders, prices that had not changed in close to 20 years. We continue to see a potential of USD 20 million incremental EBITDA contribution from this initiative on a yearly basis, as guided previously. 
Thirdly, our commercial sales team is proactively managing the dynamic pricing in order to grow our market share in gas oil fuel sands through spot deals as well as bringing new corporate customers. Finally, international expansion remains integral to our growth strategy. And we are well positioned to harness international growth opportunities. We have now received no objection certificate from the General Authority of Competition in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to acquire 35 stations. These deals were announced previously in December 2020 and in February 2021 in 3 transactions. 
Beyond these 35 stations, we are continuing to explore further opportunities to expand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other international markets as long as they meet our commercial investment guidelines. 
Moving on to our second pillar of growth strategy is the nonfuel retail business. We have opened 14 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first half of this year. Our network increased by 18% year-on-year to 340 C-stores as compared -- as at 30th of June 2021. After a strong momentum in the revitalization of our convenience stores in 2020. The pace of our program has continued in the first half of 2021 with refurbishment of 24 convenience stores. We aim to offer a superior experience through various customer-centric initiatives such as a modern and [indiscernible] environment, improvement in our [indiscernible] management, the introduction of high-margin fresh food and premier coffee products. 
On the back of these initiatives, we saw increase in convenience stores margin by circa 450 bps to 31.7%. While average gross basket size is down in the first half of this year compared to last year, this comes after a 20% increase in 2020 which was driven by a change in customer behavior during the highest of the pandemic. Customers were visiting less frequently but buying more in a single transaction. With a strong rebound in nonfuel transactions this year, we are seeing normalization of this trend. Having said that, gross basket size is still 18% higher than prepandemic close, supported by superior nonfuel proposition. 
We have also maintained our focus to provide increased level of convenience to customers through our partnership with delivery services such as Talabat and Carriage, which allows customers to order from more than 1,700 ADNOC Oasis products from over 100 convenience stores across United are beverages. 
Lastly, we are also expanding other nonfuel services. UCF is so fun, we are opening new vehicle inspection centers and continue to look at options to further expand nonfuel services at more locations. 
ADNOC Rewards, the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider continue to grow as well. We launched a new partnership with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms to cross-exchange points and maximize benefits. We also added 8 new partners to the reward program in the first half of this year, bringing the total number of partners to 40 and offering members even more deals. This comes from some of the UAE best leisure and entertainment brands. ADNOC Rewards has now more than 1 million registered users as of end of first quarter -- first half of this year and approximately 17 million transactions since the launch of the Cobra, something that we're extremely proud of. 
To further encourage [indiscernible] is further encouraged use of the reward program and to drive an increased customer spending, a number of offers and promotional campaigns were activated in stores at stations, aiming to further enhance customer experience and offering a range of added value incentives that need a wide range of customer interest, offering more with every visit to an auto service station. 
I will now hand over to Hamed to present the highlights of our financial reports. Hamed, over to you."

I'm going to take you through our financial performance for the first half of the year. So we've demonstrated strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter as well as the consolidated first half of the year with strong EBITDA and net profit growth. Now this comes despite normalization of fuel retail margins and demonstrate progress on our key pillars of growth. That's fuel volume recovery, market share gain in Dubai, and improvement in our margins across businesses. And lastly, reduction in our operating expenditure. 
First half of the year, H1 2021 revenue increased by 16.9% year-on-year. Now this was driven by fuel volumes growth, higher selling prices, of course, as a result of higher crude oil prices and recovery as well in our nonfuel revenue. So the total gross profit increased by 4.2% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period of last year. Again, this was mainly driven by nonfuel retail and commercial segments, partially offset by a decline in the fuel retail gross profit. Now I'm going to elaborate further on that on the business side performance in the next couple of slides. 
First half 2021 reported EBITDA, USD 416 million marks an increase by 21.8%. Again, this is driven by higher gross profit as well as increased operational efficiencies. We also reported lower negative one-off items of USD 18 million in the first half of the year. Of course, the first half of last year, 2020 was negatively impacted by a total of $46 million of one-off items. Now this related to additional pension costs as well as the COVID-19 expenditure, in addition to additional prudent provisioning on trade receivables and write-off of capital work in process. 
So the underlying EBITDA. Once we exclude inventory gains, losses, one-offs, decreased by 1.5% in the first half of this year when compared to the same period last year. Once again driven by lower retail fuel margins. If you recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of last year. Now this was clearly benefiting from stable retail pump prices despite the decline in oil prices and our fuel supply costs. However, as we stated earlier, this started to normalize since February of this year, after the increase in oil prices. For the retail pump prices are now closely following movement in oil prices, and we're recording regulated guaranteed retail fuel margins. 
H1 2021 net profit was USD 314 million. This is an increase of 26.6% compared to the first half of last year. Of course, this is because of the higher EBITDA. 
Let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the second quarter and the first half of the year. H1 2021, the total fuel volumes increased 9% year-on-year. While our total volumes are still down by about 4% compared to pre-COVID levels, that is if we do a comparison to the first half of 2019. We're still seeing quarter-on-quarter improvements driven by improving consumer sentiment as well as the contribution from our new device stations. 
For the retail fuel volumes, which comprise almost 68% of our total fuel sales in the first half of the year increased by 14.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2021, and 43.4% year-on-year in second quarter of 2021. 
On the commercial side, the fuel volumes were down by 1.6% year-on-year in the first half of the year. Now this was mainly due to lower uptake from our strategic aviation customers, but this was partially offset by growth in the corporate fuel volumes. This growth was driven by increase in gas oil sales on the back of a proactive sales strategy to gain more and more spot deals. 
On the nonfuel business side, the transactions increased by 3.9% year-on-year in the first half of the year. And on a quarterly basis, 39.7%, driven by significant recovery compared to last year and supported by the expansion in our C-stores, car wash and the vehicle inspection centers in the nonfuel retail side. 
As mentioned by the CEO, the average gross basket size declined by about 6.6% year-on-year in the first half of the year, but remain quite higher than the levels we saw in 2019. In the first half of the year this year, we continue to see benefits of our nonfuel strategy, our CECO revitalization program, with improvement in our C-stores gross margin to 31.7% in the first half of the year versus 27.2% first half of last year. 
To move on to the gross profit performance by segment. Our first half 2021 gross profit increased by 4.2%, driven both by commercial as well as the nonfuel retail businesses. For the Retail segment, gross profit decreased by 2.4% year-on-year. This was driven by lower fuel retail business worse profit, as I explained earlier. However, this has been partially offset by volume growth, inventory gains of USD 53 million as well as recovery in the nonfuel side of the business. The 
fuel retail gross profit declined by 5.9% year-on-year despite volume growth and inventory gains. This was mainly due to lower margins. Our nonfuel retail gross profit, which increased by 26.9% in the first half of the year was driven by a strong recovery compared to last year. Last year, of course, we were heavily impacted by the lockdown restrictions, but the improvement in the margins of our C-store business equally supported by the nonfuel -- also supported the nonfuel gross pocket growth. 
The convenience stores business margin improved as a result of better product mix. And as the CEO mentioned earlier, the introduction of high-margin fresh food and coffee products, which is, of course, part of our revitalization program. 
On the commercial business side, gross profit increased by 23.7%. This was driven by higher corporate volumes and margins. Of course, last year, first half is heavily negatively impacted by one-off items of about USD 6 million. 
On the EBITDA by segment side. As I mentioned earlier, the first half of the year 2021 EBITDA has increased by 21.8%, as you can see. On top of higher gross profit, OpEx optimization, lower one-off expenditure has supported the growth of the EBITDA. 
On the Retail side, the first half of the year, EBITDA increased by 5.3% year-on-year. Despite lower gross profit margin in fuel retail but help and driven mainly buy reduction in operating expenditure. 
On the commercial side, the EBITDA growth was driven by higher gross profit lower operating expenditure. And for the sake of comparison, the first half of last year also included negative one-offs, as I explained earlier. Now once we exclude the inventory gains or losses however, this year, we're looking at gains. As well as one-offs, the underlying EBITDA was marginally down due to lower retail fuel margins. Let's have a look at the operating expenditure side, our total OpEx decreased by 7% year-on-year in the first half of the year. 
Now once we exclude depreciation, our cash OpEx decreased by 9.9% year-on-year in half 1 -- in H1, and by 13.1% in the second quarter. Now this demonstrates benefits extracted from management initiatives to increase efficiency across all our businesses. Of course, we remain committed to reducing operating expenditure. 
As a result, we've realized like-for-like operating expenditure savings of $7 million in the second quarter of the year. Now this is after we realized $10 million during the first quarter of the year. This foods in a strong position to achieve our full year target for operating expenditure savings. The full year target of ours is USD 25 million. This reduction in like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimizing and staffing costs, which, of course, remains a major piece of our total operating expenditure. 
Now while we have been diligently focused on our COVID-19 response, ensuring the safety and the well-being of our staff and our customers, the transformation efforts will continue to ensure that operating costs are market competitive, and the company, ADNOC Distribution, remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth ambitions. 
Let's move on to the cash side. Looking at cash generation, the company generated free cash flow of USD 680 million in the first half of the year. Of course, this was driven by strong cash flow from operations as well as positive working capital. 
Now on the positive working capital movement side, this resulted mainly due to increase in dues to related parties. The increase was resulting from higher fuel purchases, as well as the higher value of fuel purchases, which comes from a oil price environment where the prices are consistently rising. Now this was partially offset by increase in inventories as well as increase in dues from related parties. In line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy. We've spent, so far this year, capital expenditure of USD 80 million in the first half of the year. We maintained a strong balance sheet at the end of 30th of June 2021. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.46 multiple remains well below 2x as per our commitment. 
I'm going to hand it back over to the CEO."

We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner, deliver an enhanced customer experience, further optimize our operation to become a leading, cost-efficient fuel retailer and generate sustainable value creation for our shareholders. 
Our domestic and international expansion momentum seems likely to sustain in 2021. In our convenience stores business, 60%, nearly 50% of our C-store network that was operational at the end of 2019 will be refurbished by the end of 2021. This will put us in a better position to reap the benefits of our initiatives that offer superior customer journey and in-store experience, coupled with high-margin products. We are confident of achieving growth in our convenience stores business once the economy recovers fully from the impact of tender. We are also confident that we will sustain an attractive dividend payback backed by a strong balance sheet and confidence in cash flow generation capability while maintaining sufficient cash to support our growth.

And is this something in part that you'd like to change or improve going forward? 
And the second question from nonfuel sales. So I know you guys tried this, I don't know, call it the experiment a couple of years back to remove assisted fueling, which is something that made sense. Back then, I remember what happened was that you had some issues with competition. A lot of the customers decided to go to some competitors. I was just wondering why didn't you see that strategy in Abu Dhabi, where you don't have any competition? And maybe switch back to the old model with -- or the current model in the Northern Emirates?"

I think as the company directionally try to play our part as well, promoting energy efficiency where they're needed and necessary and doable. We definitely are agile and resilient to adapt to new more efficient operating models. And in fact, we do have also the strategy in making of the EV -- adaptation of EV. We will definitely communicate more on this front as our plans mature. But by and large, all in all, ADNOC Distribution is part of a wider group, and we definitely believe in the energy generation and the role and the contribution to each player in their respective sectors to support the energy transition that is also still headed by the Ministry of Energy of the United Arab Emirates. So we are not in isolation of this topic and definitely have a role to play, and that will become even more and more solid as our plans mature in the coming chapter of ADNOC Distribution.

Thanks. Look, it's a good question. At the time that we explained when that decision was taken to remove flex whereby we charge AED 10 for full service, that was taken after discussions directly with our customers, focus workshops, working groups, where we called our customers in, conducted many -- hundreds of these workshops. Overwhelmingly, the feedback that had come back was, if we want to grow, particularly in markets where we do not dominate like Dubai, Northern Emirates, it was important to retain our customers. And this was a very critical point on which we were losing the goodwill from the customers. They did not like it. They did not like the AED 10 charge, and the competition was not charging it. 
Now turning around and saying, where I have competition in the market, we're going to start or charge nothing. Come to Abu Dhabi, where we are an effective monopoly, if we charge you $10, that would seem exploitative. And we did not want to be viewed as such. Same customers that fuel up here, majority of them also come to us in Dubai, in Northern Emirates. So it's important to regain our customers, to regain that goodwill and address an extremely painful pinpoint, so to speak, for our customers. It was important that we took it off across the board. 
Now financially, we lost the revenues that resulted from Flex and from charging that fee, but over the long run, I showed to our customers that we are a customer-centric organization. And if this was something that was absolutely bothering our customers, we decided to take it off. And that helped out, especially, again, as I said, as we continue to grow in Dubai and Northern Emirates."

But I can assure you, before we decided to drop this, we explored multiple options. Could we return this value back in different forms? It's value accretive. And the bottom line was customers just did not like it. They did not like the fact that combination did not charge we were charging it, irrespective of what happened with those coupons we gave. So you fuel up, you pay the $10, you get a coupon, you go inside, you pick up 3 products.  Besides to point. The fact that we were charging for something that competition wasn't charging, they just did not like it. And after listening to our customers, we just decided to pull it out. 
Now trying other options, similar to Flex, any time you leave yourself, i.e., the company, at a disparity with your competition, it's a risk. It's a risk in that it could be perceived better than competition, but equally, it could be received as worse than competition. Come into the station, you fuel up and there's no other nuances, complexities, propositions that you have to deal with. It's free. You pay for the fuel and you go on. It's as simple as that. So that's why, even though we had explored multiple options, the best decision at the time was to completely drop it. And in retrospect, it's been a good decision."

And now after achieving scale and partnering with different counterparties, they actually have put in place monetization plan. Do you have similar plans for ADNOC Rewards? That's my question number one. 
The second question is with reference to vehicle inspection and servicing business. I mean that part of the business is very fragmented if you see the market. Do you have any plan to consolidate that business basically to gain more customers? Is it lucrative enough?"

And a second, not secondary, but a second primary objective was to increase stickiness. Gives them a reason not just to come to us when you're in Abu Dhabi, where there's monopoly, but also come to us in Dubai in the Northern Emirates and stack up the points. 
Do we have any plans short or long term to monetize that data that immense amount of data that we're building up where we get to know our customers? And the simple answer to that is no, not at the moment. But we have objectives in mind. Those objectives are being that customer stickiness, and an enhanced customer experience when they come to our stations."

It's an important contributor to our financials and EBITDA. Definitely, we see synergy playing a role in this space. For the question, I believe, was about running this -- consolidating this business. And this -- the answer is twofold. One, we do run it from a distribution point of view as a portfolio. Hence, it is consolidated on a more leadership within the company, and then we look at it as a portfolio of vehicle special centers trying to extract synergies where possible on manpower and resources and some, what you call it, maintenance and equipment and supply chain-related aspects in support of this pillar. Having said that, in actual sense, the -- it is fragmented in practical sense, given the nature of the Federation of the United Arab Emirates, the vehicle centers are adjacencies to the license registration of vehicles in this nation. And each Emirate has its own regulation and also custodians of this activity, so we deal with Banabi police, we deal with Dubai Police and so on and so fourth, [indiscernible] each Emirates has their regulatory framework or regulatory entities that governs this sector. And we are definitely working in close collaboration with them by default by the nature of the setup of the local and that entity is not managing the deco registration with vehicle inspection centers not adjacent to them. It is [indiscernible] in that sense. But from a company perspective, we have a consolidation within other distribution. We drive synergies in the supply chain and equipment and resources and so on and so forth, so the value there is we continue to try to extract the maximum value by managing the same as a portfolio of centers under our belt."

So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ADNOC Distribution conference call for the second quarter and half year 2021 results. I have with me Bader Lamki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mohamed Al Hashimi, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin, I would like to acknowledge that we experienced a technical issue at the beginning of the trading session this morning. So we worked quickly with the ADX to resolve this within 90 minutes and to minimize any disruption and inconvenience. 
Moving on to today's call, we will take you through the key highlights of H1 2021 and outlook. We will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update and financial performance. We will then answer any questions you may have at the end of this presentation. 
Before we begin, please -- next slide, please. So before we begin, please allow me to reiterate our cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. This presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are deferred in the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of this disclaimer and other important information. 
So I would like to provide you with a summary of the company's key achievements in H1 2021, and the progress we have made in delivering on our 2021 macro strategy. Our CEO and CFO will provide further insight on our strategy and financial performance. ADNOC Distribution continues to offer an attractive value proposition with the combination of a resilient business model, growth potential and a highly visible and predictable dividend policy. 
In H1 2021, the company delivered a strong financial performance, demonstrating its resilient and agile business model and the progress being made in delivering on its smart growth strategy. 
Let me begin with business resilience. The company's fuel volumes continue to see progressive recovery towards pre-COVID levels with 96% volume recovery in Q2 and H1 2021 compared to 90% recovery at the end Q4 2020. This gradual recovery is an indication of improving consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE. In addition, we continue to see incremental volumes from our Dubai stations together with a proactive set strategy in our corporate business. Despite ongoing expansion in H1 2021, the company already realized around 70% of its 2021 targeted like-for-like OpEx savings of $25 million. 
In terms of smart growth now. In H1 2021, we continue to build on our 2020 momentum and made significant progress on our domestic and international expansion. The company remains on track to deliver on its 2021 growth targets to open 30 to 35 stations in the UAE, including 12 to 18 locations in Dubai and 40 to 45 stations in Saudi Arabia. 
We also continue to deliver on our promise to bring modern digitally enabled retail convenience for customers and communities. In line with our ambitious nonfuel retail strategy, we refurbished 24 convenience stores in the first half of the year to offer fresh store layout and new food offerings, further enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish a total of 40 to 60 stores. 
Finally, ADNOC Distribution offers attractive long-term returns to shareholders, underpinned by its progressive dividend policy that offers high visibility of cash returns. So the dividend policy approved by our Board and shareholders recognize the company's strong financial position and demonstrates their confidence in growth prospects and cash flow generation ability going forward. 
The dividend policy set 2021 dividend at $700 million, offering 4.7% yield. We expect to pay $350 million cash dividend for the first half of 2021 in October 2021, subject to the Board's approval. For 2022, dividend is set at minimum $700 million. And for years thereafter, dividend is set at a minimum of 75% of distributable profits. These dividend payments are again subject to the approval by the Board and shareholders. 
I would also take this opportunity to highlight that ADNOC, who is a major shareholder of ADNOC Distribution, has successfully placed 10% of the company's share capital in September 2020, doubling free float to 20%. More recently, in May 2021, ADNOC placed additional 3% of the company's share capital increasing free float further to 23%. This has allowed a significant increase in trading liquidity of ADNOC Distribution shares on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. 
Following the higher free float and trading liquidity, ADNOC Distribution shares were included in the MSCI EM in May 2021, and we expect [indiscernible] milestone in the coming months with a potential FTSE EM inclusion in September 2021. This will further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into ADNOC Distribution shares. 
I will now hand over to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update of our growth strategy. Bader, over to you, please."

I'm delighted today to be speaking with you, as I marked close to 100 days in my role as a CEO of ADNOC Distribution. For those who don't know my background, my expertise is in the oil and gas sector, clean energy and utility sector. And most recently, I had been the CEO of the National Central Cooling Company, Tabreed, which is a publicly listed company in the DFM. Since its IPO in 2017, ADNOC Distribution has been on a journey.
Our cultural transformation, as a leading retail company, ensures we have a clear focus on profitable growth and capital discipline. I'm pleased to share with you that we'll continue to accelerate delivery of our growth plans and transform the fuel stations experience into a modern retail destination, which offers comprehensive fuel and nonfuel services for all our customers. While we will continue to meet energy needs of our customers and communities, we must do so sustainably and make our business more resilient and lead the UAE and the world energy transition towards a low carbon future. 
Our digital transformation strategy and IT modernization remains a key enabler. A key enabler for us to continue increasing efficiency and optimizing our resources. In Q2, we completed the successful upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system to -- which will further strengthen our operational efficiencies and processes. We have a very promising future with significant opportunities ahead. 
Today, I want to run with you our further progress -- update you on the further progress of our growth strategy. I think before I do so, I would like first to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our employees, customers and all stakeholders, which remains our key priorities at all times. Supporting the nation's ongoing fight against CoVID-19, ADNOC Distribution has assured that all health and safety measures are maintained. And in H1 2021, the company became the first fuel retail in the world with 100% of its frontline staff to be vaccinated, something that we're extremely proud of.  It's an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to the nation's recovery from this pandemic. 
Coming back to our strategy. I'll begin first by outlining the key pillars for growth starting with our fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. With the addition of 12 new stations in H1 2021, our fuel network has grown by 13% compared to H1 in 2020. We maintain a leading marketing position in the UAE in the UAE retail fuel network. And now we are operating probably 457 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of June of this year. We remain focused on adding value for both customers and shareholders. And the underpenetrated Dubai market is an integral part of this. 
In the first half of this year, we opened five new stations in Dubai, which means our stations network in the emirates has increased from 26 service station at the end of 2020 to 31 stations by the end of June 2021. We are continuing to gain market share in Dubai, a key market of growth with high double-digit growth fuel volume driven by new station operating. 
We have seen growth materializing from management initiatives in our commercial business. What I can share in this regard, we have seen an increase in sales in the bulk LPG, supported by strict enforcement by government authorities to control gray market activities. Secondly, profitability of our LPG cylinder business has also increased following last year's decision to increase the prices of LPG cylinders, prices that had not changed in close to 20 years. We continue to see a potential of USD 20 million incremental EBITDA contribution from this initiative on a yearly basis, as guided previously. 
Thirdly, our commercial sales team is proactively managing the dynamic pricing in order to grow our market share in gas oil fuel sales through spot deals as well as bringing new corporate customers. Finally, international expansion remains an integral to our growth strategy. And we are well positioned to harness international growth opportunities. We have now received no objection certificate from the General Authority of Competition in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to acquire 35 stations. These deals were announced previously in December 2020 and in February 2021 in three transactions. 
Beyond these 35 stations, we are continuing to explore further opportunities to expand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other international markets as long as they meet our commercial investment guidelines. 
Moving on to our second pillar of growth strategy is the nonfuel retail business. We have opened 14 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first half of this year. Our network increased by 18% year-on-year to 340 C-stores as compared -- as at 30th of June 2021. After a strong momentum in the revitalization of our convenience stores in 2020, the pace of our program has continued in the first half of 2021 with refurbishment of 24 convenience stores. We aim to offer a superior experience through various customer-centric initiatives such as a modern and digitally enabled environment, improvement in our t category management, the introduction of high-margin fresh food and premier coffee products. 
On the back of these initiatives, we saw increase in convenience stores margin by circa 450 bps to 31.7%. While average gross basket size is down in the first half of this year compared to last year, this comes after a 20% increase in 2020, which was driven by a change in customer behavior during the highest of the pandemic. Customers were visiting less frequently but buying more in a single transaction. With a strong rebound in nonfuel transactions this year, we are seeing normalization of this trend. Having said that, gross basket size is still 18% higher than prepandemic close, supported by superior nonfuel proposition. 
We have also maintained our focus to provide increased level of convenience to customers through our partnership with delivery services such as Talabat and Carriage, which allows customers to order from more than 1,700 ADNOC Oasis products from over 100 convenience stores across United Arab Emirates. 
Lastly, we are also expanding other nonfuel services. This year so far we have opened new vehicle inspection centers and continue to look at options to further expand nonfuel services at more locations. 
ADNOC Rewards, the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider continue to grow as well. We launched a new partnership with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms to cross-exchange points and maximize benefits. We also added 18 new partners to the reward program in the first half of this year, bringing the total number of partners to 40 and offering members even more deals and discounts from some of the UAE best leisure and entertainment brands. 
ADNOC Rewards has now more than 1 million registered users as of end of first quarter -- first half of this year and approximately 17 million transactions since the launch of the program, something that we're extremely proud of. 
To further encourage users -- to further encourage use of the reward program and to drive an increased customer spending, a number of offers and promotional campaigns were activated in stores at stations, aiming to further enhance customer experience and offering a range of added value incentives that meet a wide range of customer taste and interest offering more with every visit to an ADNOC service station. 
I will now hand over to Mohamed to present the highlights of our financial performance. Mohamed, over to you."

Thanks, Bader. So first of all, good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to take you through our financial performance for the first half of the year.

I'm going to take you through our financial performance for the first half of the year. So we've demonstrated strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter as well as the consolidated first half of the year with strong EBITDA and net profit growth. Now this comes despite normalization of fuel retail margins and it demonstrates progress on our key pillars of growth. That's fuel volume recovery, market share gain in Dubai, and in improvement in our margins across businesses, and lastly reduction in our operating expenditure. 
First half of the year, H1 2021 revenue increased by 16.9% year-on-year. Now this was driven by fuel volumes growth, higher selling prices, of course, as a result of higher crude oil prices and recovery as well in our nonfuel revenue. So the total gross profit increased by 4.2% in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period of last year. Again, this was mainly driven by nonfuel retail and commercial segments, partially offset by a decline in the fuel retail gross profit. Now I'm going to elaborate further on that on the business wise performance in the next couple of slides. 
First half 2021 reported EBITDA, USD 416 million, marks an increase by 21.8%. Again, this is driven by higher gross profit as well as increased operational efficiencies. We also reported lower negative one-off items of USD 18 million in the first half of the year. Of course, the first half of last year, 2020 was negatively impacted by a total of $46 million of one-off items. Now this related to additional pension costs as well as the COVID-19 expenditure, in addition to additional prudent provisioning on trade receivables and write-off of capital work in process. 
So the underlying EBITDA. Once we exclude inventory gains, losses, one-offs, decreased by 1.5% in the first half of this year when compared to the same period last year. Once again driven by lower retail fuel margins. If you recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of last year. Now this was clearly benefiting from stable retail pump prices despite the decline in oil prices and our fuel supply costs. However, as we stated earlier, this started to normalize since February of this year, after the increase in oil prices. So the retail pump prices are now closely following movement in oil prices, and we're recording regulated guaranteed retail fuel margins. 
H1 2021 net profit was USD 314 million. This is an increase of 26.6% compared to the first half of last year. Of course, this is because of the higher EBITDA. 
Let me briefly walk you through the key operational highlights for the second quarter and the first half of the year. H1 2021, the total fuel volumes increased 9% year-on-year, while our total volumes are still down by about 4% compared to pre-COVID levels, that is if we do a comparison to the first half of 2019. We're still seeing quarter-on-quarter improvements driven by improving consumer sentiments as well as the contribution from our new device stations. 
For the retail fuel volumes, which comprised almost 68% of our total fuel sales in the first half of the year, increased by 14.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2021, and 43.4% year-on-year in second quarter of 2021. 
On the commercial side, the fuel volumes were down by 1.6% year-on-year in the first half of the year. And this was mainly due to lower uptake from our strategic aviation customers, but this was partially offset by growth in the corporate fuel volumes. This growth was driven by increase in gas oil sales on the back of a proactive sales strategy to gain more and more spot deals. 
On the nonfuel business side, the transactions increased by 3.9% year-on-year in the first half of the year. And on a quarterly basis, 39.7%, driven by significant recovery compared to last year and supported by the expansion in our C-stores, car wash and the vehicle inspection centers in the nonfuel retail side. 
As mentioned by the CEO, the average gross basket size declined by about 6.6% year-on-year in the first half of the year, but remain quite higher than the levels we saw in 2019. In the first half of the year this year, we continue to see benefits of our nonfuel strategy, our C-store revitalization program, with improvement in our C-stores gross margin to 31.7% in the first half of the year versus 27.2% first half of last year. 
To move on to the gross profit performance by segment. Our first half 2021 gross profit increased by 4.2%, driven both by commercial as well as the nonfuel retail businesses. For the retail segment, gross profit decreased by 2.4% year-on-year. This was driven by lower fuel retail business gross profit, as I explained earlier. However, this has been partially offset by volume growth, inventory gains of USD 53 million as well as recovery in the nonfuel side of the business. 
The fuel retail gross profit declined by 5.9% year-on-year despite volume growth and inventory gains. This was mainly due to lower margins. Our nonfuel retail gross profit, which increased by 26.9% in the first half of the year was driven by a strong recovery compared to last year. Last year, of course, we were heavily impacted by the lockdown restrictions, but the improvement in the margins of our C-store business equally supported by the nonfuel -- also supported the nonfuel gross profit growth. 
The convenience stores business margin improved as a result of better product mix. And as the CEO mentioned earlier, the introduction of high-margin fresh food and coffee products, which is, of course, part of our revitalization program. 
On the commercial business side, gross profit increased by 23.7%. This was driven by higher corporate volumes and margins. Of course, last year, first half of 2020 is heavily negatively impacted by one-off items of about USD 6 million. 
On the EBITDA by segment side. As I mentioned earlier, the first half of the year 2021 EBITDA has increased by 21.8%, as you can see. On top of higher gross profit, OpEx optimization, lower one-off expenditure has supported the growth of the EBITDA. 
On the Retail side, the first half of the year, EBITDA increased by 5.3% year-on-year despite lower gross profit margin in fuel retail, but helped and driven mainly by reduction in operating expenditure. 
On the commercial side, the EBITDA growth was driven by higher gross profit, lower operating expenditure and for the sake of comparison, the first half of last year also included negative one-offs, as I explained earlier. Now once we exclude the inventory gains or losses, however, this year, we're looking at gains as well as one-offs, the underlying EBITDA was marginally down due to lower retail fuel margins. Let's have a look at the operating expenditure side, our total OpEx decreased by 7% year-on-year in the first half of the year. 
Now once we exclude depreciation, our cash OpEx decreased by 9.9% year-on-year in half 1 -- in H1, and by 13.1% in the second quarter. Now this demonstrates benefits extracted from management initiatives to increase efficiency across all our businesses. Of course, we remain committed to reducing operating expenditure. 
As a result, we've realized like-for-like operating expenditure savings of $7 million in the second quarter of the year. Now this is after we realized $10 million during the first quarter of the year. This puts us in a strong position to achieve our full year target for operating expenditure savings. The full year target of course is USD 25 million. This reduction in like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimizing and staffing costs, which, of course, remains a major piece of our total operating expenditure. 
Now while we have been diligently focused on our COVID-19 response, ensuring the safety and the well-being of our staff and our customers, the transformation efforts will continue to ensure that operating costs are market competitive, and the company, ADNOC Distribution, remains well positioned to deliver on our future growth ambitions. 
Let's move on to the cash side. Looking at cash generation, the company generated free cash flow of USD 680 million in the first half of the year. Of course, this was driven by strong cash flow from operations as well as positive working capital. 
Now on the positive working capital movement side, this resulted mainly due to increase in dues to related parties. The increase was resulting from higher fuel purchases,as well as the higher value of fuel purchases, which comes from a oil price environment, where the prices are consistently rising. Now this was partially offset by increase in inventories as well as increase in dues from related parties. In line with our guidance and plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we've spent, so far this year, capital expenditure of USD 80 million in the first half of the year. We maintained a strong balance sheet at the end of 30th of June 2021. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.46 multiple remains well below 2x as per our commitment. 
I'm going to hand it back over to the CEO."

We remain committed to pursue our expansion plans in a disciplined manner, deliver an enhanced customer experience, further optimize our operation to become a leading, cost-efficient fuel retailer and generate sustainable value creation for our shareholders. 
Our domestic and international expansion momentum seems likely to sustain in 2021. In our convenience stores business, 60% -- nearly 60% of our C-store network that was operational at the end of 2019 will be refurbished by the end of 2021. This will put us in a better position to reap the benefits of our initiatives that offer superior customer journey and in-store experience, coupled with high-margin products. We are confident of achieving growth in our convenience stores business once the UAE economy recovers fully from the impact of the pandemic. We are also confident that we will sustain an attractive dividend payback backed by a strong balance sheet and confidence in cash flow generation capability while retaining sufficient cash to support our growth.

And the second question is from nonfuel sales. So I know you guys tried this, I don't know, call it the experiment a couple of years back to remove assisted fueling, which of this something that made sense. Back then, I remember what happened was that you had some issues with competition, a lot of the customers decided to go to some competitors. I was just wondering why didn't you keep that strategy in Abu Dhabi, where you don't have any competition?

Coming into ADNOC Distribution, I'm pleased to know that the group has a strong commitment to playing an active role in this space. I think as the company directional, we try to play our part as well, promoting energy efficiency where they needed necessary and doable. We definitely are agile and resilient to adapt to new more efficient operating models. And in fact, we do have also the strategy in making of the EV -- adaptation of EV. We will definitely communicate more on this front as our plans mature. But by and large, all in all, ADNOC Distribution is part of a wider group, and we definitely believe in the energy transition and the role and the contribution to each player in their respective sectors to support the energy transition that is also spearheaded by the Ministry of Energy of the United Arab Emirates so we are not in isolation of this topic and definitely have a role to play and that will become even more and more solid as our plans mature in the coming chapter of ADNOC Distribution.

Thanks, Bader. Look, it's a good question. At the time that we explained when that decision was taken to remove Flex whereby we charge AED 10 for full service, that was taken after discussions directly with our customers, focus workshops, working groups, where we called our customers in, conducted many -- hundreds of these workshops. Overwhelmingly, the feedback that had come back was, if we want to grow, particularly in markets where we do not dominate like Dubai, Northern Emirates, it was important to retain our customers. And this was a very critical point on which we were losing the goodwill from the customers. They did not like it. They did not like the AED 10 charge, and the competition was not charging it. 
Now turning around and saying, where I have competition in the market, we're going to charge you nothing. Come to Abu Dhabi, where we are an effective monopoly, if we charge you $10, that would seem exploitative. And we did not want to be viewed as such. Same customers that fuel up here, majority of them also come to us in Dubai, in Northern Emirates. So it's important to regain our customers, to regain that goodwill and address an extremely painful pain point, so to speak, for our customers. It was important that we took it off across the board. 
Now financially, we lost the revenues that resulted from Flex and from charging that fee, but over the long run, I showed to our customers that we are a customer-centric organization. And if this was something that was absolutely bothering our customers, we decided to take it off. And that helped out, especially, again, as I said, as we continue to grow in Dubai and Northern Emirates."

But I can assure you, before we decided to drop this, we explored multiple options. Could we return this value back in different forms? It's value accretive. And the bottom line was customers just did not like it. They did not like the fact that combination did not charge it, we were charging it, irrespective of what happened with those coupons we gave them. So you fuel up, you pay the $10, you get a coupon, you go inside, you pick up three products. Besides to point, the fact that we were charging for something that competition wasn't charging, they just did not like it. And after listening to our customers, we just decided to pull it out. 
Now trying other options, similar to Flex, any time you leave yourself, i.e., the company, at a disparity with your competition, it's a risk. It's a risk in that it could be perceived better than competition, but equally, it could be received as worse than competition. You come into the station, you fuel up and there's no other nuances, complexities, propositions that you have to deal with. It's free. You pay for the fuel and you go on. It's as simple as that. So that's why, even though we had explored multiple options, the best decision at the time was to completely drop it. And in retrospect, it's been a good decision."

What is the long-term strategic plan for monetizing that particular program? Like I noticed at Etisalat, there, on the Smiles program, right? And now after achieving scale and partnering with different counterparties, they actually have put in place monetization plan. Do you have similar plans for ADNOC Rewards? That's my question number one. 
The second question is with reference to vehicle inspection and servicing business. I mean that part of the business is very fragmented if you see the market. Do you have any plan to consolidate that type business basically to gain more customers? Is it lucrative enough?"

And a second, not secondary, but a second primary objective was to increase stickiness. Gives them a reason not just to come to us when you're in Abu Dhabi, where there's monopoly, but also come to us in Dubai in the Northern Emirates and stack up the points. 
Do we have any plans short or long term to monetize that data that immense amount of data that we're building up where we get to know our customers? And the simple answer to that is no, not at the moment. But we have objectives in mind. Those objectives are being that customer stickiness, and an enhanced customer experience when they come to our stations."

One, we do run it from an ADNOC Distribution point of view as a portfolio. Hence, it is consolidated on a more leadership within the company, and then we look at it as a portfolio of vehicle special centers, trying to extract synergies where possible on manpower and resources and some, what you call it, maintenance and equipments and supply chain-related aspects in support of this pillar -- vertical. Having said that, in actual sense, the -- it is fragmented in practical sense, given the nature of the Federation of the United Arab Emirates. The vehicle inspection centers are adjacencies to the license registration of vehicles in this nation. And each Emirate has its own regulation and also custodians of this activity, so we deal with Abu Dhabi police, we deal with Dubai Police and so on and so forth, Sharjah, Ajman, so on and so forth of the other Emirates of their own regulatory framework or regulatory entities that governs this sector. And we are definitely working in close collaboration with them by default by the nature of the setup of the local Emirates entity that managing the vehicle registration with vehicle inspection centers that are adjacent to them. It is fragmented in that sense. But from a company perspective, we have a consolidation within other distribution. We drive synergies in the supply chain and equipments and resources and so on and so forth, so the value there is -- we continue to try to extract the maximum value by managing the same as a portfolio of centers under our belt."

For more information, please refer to the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of the disclaimer and other important information.So I will now go through the summary of the company's key achievements in the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. So in 9M [phonetic] 2:31 2021, ADNOC distribution demonstrated a resilient operating and financial performance, 2021 reported 9M EBITDA, a net profit increased by 6.2% and 6.3% respectively compared to last year.Total fuel volume and non-fuel transactions continue to improve, and we have witnessed encouraging results, especially since September. This improvement is underpinned by a positive consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE, further is in mobility restrictions, such as 100% government employees returning back to offices. So this improvement has also been supported by schools reopening for face-to-face learning as well as increase in international visitors coming into the UAE following ease in travel restrictions. We are also pleased to see solid progress achieved on reducing operating costs.In 9M 2021, the company already exceeded its annual cost optimization target of $25 million by achieving $26 million like-for-like OpEx savings. We remain focused on executing our smart growth strategy with solid pipeline in both domestic and international markets. We opened actually 40 new stations in the UAE. In Dubai, we opened 5 new stations with 10 stations in execution and 12 stations approved for development. We opened 16 new convenience stores and refurbished 35 convenience stores to offer an enhanced shopping experience to our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish 40 to 60 stores.Regarding the international markets. We added 10 new stations in Saudi Arabia, taking our network to 12 stations and many more are in progress to be integrated into our network shortly. This is a major milestone that solidifies our commitment to expand in international markets. We are on track to open 40 to 45 new stations in Saudi Arabia this year.Lastly, ADNOC distribution is committed to deliver attractive long-term returns to its shareholders entertained [phonetic] 0:05:30 by a solid business model and cash flows, strength in its financial position and strong growth potential following for setting a progressive policy that needs high visibility of cash returns. You can see on the right side of this slide, our dividend policy for 2021, 2022 and in the long-term. We already paid $300 million -- $350 million, sorry, cash dividend for the first half of this year in October and expect to pay a cash dividend of $350 million for the second half of this year in April 2022, subject to the Board and shareholders' approval.Lastly, from a trading perspective, I would highlight that ADNOC distribution saw a significant increase in share liquidity after key milestone we achieved. First of all, free flow doubled to 20% in September 2020 and to 23% in May 2021 following placements from our major shareholder ADNOC. Secondly, ADNOC distribution shares were included in MSCI EM index in May and in FTSE EM index in September. Inclusion in major indices would further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into our shares.Finally, we are committed to long-term sustainability of our business by contributing positively to environment, society and effectively managing governance risks. Recognizing our efforts and approach, ADNOC distribution received a rating A in the MSCI ESG Rating assessment in Q3 2021.I will now hand over the call to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Bader."

I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to re",1056,"Thank you, Athmane. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our operation and our people, which remains our key priority at all times. In its continued dedication to upholding the highest standards of health and safety, the company has ensured that 100% of its frontline employees working at the service stations have received their vaccination booster dose, an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to support the nationwide ongoing recovery and return to normalization.Talking about our strategy, I'll begin with the first key pillar of our growth, namely the fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. The company continues to see steady and progressive recovery. September, total fuel volumes increased by approximately 11% compared to August. It is expected that these volumes will continue to increase going into the fourth quarter as holiday season continues within the UAE hosts as well as the UAE hosting major international events, including export 2020.In addition, the company has continued to gain market share in Dubai, driven by new stations, doubling its September fuel volumes compared to the same period of last year. Strong volume growth in Dubai is a testament to the progress that has been made on the domestic growth strategy. Our domestic fuel network has grown by 10% compared to the first 9 months of 2020, with the addition of 14 new stations in the first 9 months of this year. We maintain a leading market position in the UAE's retail fuel sector. And now we are proudly operating 459 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of September 2021.In the first 9 months of this year, we have opened 5 new stations in Dubai. Our stations network in this particular emirate has doubled to 31 stations at the end of the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period of 2020. Dubai offers high-growth potential for the company to gain market share and is at the heart of our smart growth strategy. Our focus will remain -- remains on high-quality strategic locations in Dubai. There are currently 10 stations in various stages of execution with additional pipeline of 12 most stations already approved for further development.Beyond the growth in the UAE, international expansion remains integral part of our growth plans. You will recall, we announced 3 definitive agreements signed in December 2020 and February 2021, to acquire a total of 35 service stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Of these, 3 have added into our network as of 8 of November.In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have added 7 new stations in the Kingdom as of the 8 of November as well, through leasing sites, both Greenfields as well as existing assets. This is just the beginning of our growth journey in international market, and we are advancing on our plans to realize international growth opportunities, including Egypt and other markets.Finally, we are also focused to drive growth in our commercial business through proactive sales strategy focusing on increasing customer base, growing our LPG sales and ADNOC Voyager lubricants export sales. We saw higher profitability in LPG business in the first 9 months of this year after announcing a hike in the cylinders price last year. We are now working on further optimization of our LPG distribution model to enhance customers' experience and grow our sales. In the third quarter of 2021, we have added new distributors for ADNOC Lube business, which is now exported to 19 countries around the world.Moving to the second pillar of our growth strategy, namely the non-fuel retail business, we have continued to deliver on our vision to bring modern, digitally enabled retail convenience experience to our customers and our communities. We have opened 16 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first 9 months of this year, increasing our network by 14% year-on-year to 342 C-stores.After strong momentum in 2020, the pace of convenience stores, the habitation the innovation [phonetic] 0:13:27 program has continued in the first 9 months, and we have refurbished to date 35 convenience stores. We have made considerable progress to offer a wider product offering to our customers with an improved category management. Larger part of our network now offers fresh food and barista coffee service.We have also maintained our focus to provide an increased level of convenience stores and services to our customers through online delivery service and providing special product shelves in our stores. On the back of these initiatives, we have witnessed positive results in our convenience store business with the growth in transaction and improved profitability.Lastly, we are also expanding other non-fuel services, such as vehicle inspection and car wash centers, thereby supporting our growth in the first 9 months of 2021. We continue to look at more options and further expansion in the non-fuel business services in other locations within our operations.Customer experience remains at the heart of our growth plans and a key differentiator to add more value to every visit our customers' makes at our stations, a number of offers and promotions campaigns were activated in stores and in stations aiming to offer a range of incentives that meet a wide range of customer taste and interests.Our ADNOC reward program, which was the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider continue to grow in the first 9 months of this year. We have now over 1.2 million loyalty members, which represents a 20% increase compared to end of 2020 and recorded 23.5 million transactions since the launch of the program.We have launched new partnerships with Etisalat mines, which allows members of both platforms to cross exchange points and maximize benefits. We have also now 39 partners offering memberships, even more deals and discounts from some of the UAE's best leisure and entertainment brands.During Q3 of 2021, we have launched a series of promotions throughout the quarter, including the Let's go Shop and Win Raffle, which shows 60 million entries over the 3 months campaign period.I will now hand over to Mohamed to present the highlights of the financial performance."

Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forwa",1329,"Thank you. Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forward on our growth plans and maintaining a strong balance sheet.Our revenues have increased by 22.6%. This is compared to the same period as of last year. This was driven by higher selling prices, higher, resulting from higher crude oil prices as well as retail fuel volume growth and recovery in non-fuel revenues. Our gross profit has declined by approximately 10.1% compared to the same period as of last year. This was mainly due to lower retail fuel business gross margin.Now, when we get to the business-wise performance in the next couple of slides, we will elaborate on this further. The reported EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, standing at USD 617 million, and this was driven by improved operating performance. The underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory gains, losses and any other one-offs, shows a decrease of approximately 21% for the 9 months of this year compared to the 9 months of last year.Again, this was mainly due to the lower retail fuel margins. But if we exclude the high base effect of exceptional retail fuel margins last year, the company's demonstrated improvement in the operating performance, including growth in retail fuel volumes, growth in non-fuel transactions, the margin improving in non-fuel and both commercial businesses and increasingly enhanced operating cost efficiencies. So for the 9 months of 2021, our net profit was USD 458 million. This is an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year, of course, driven by higher EBITDA.Let's look at the key operating highlights for 9 months of this year, the total fuel volumes have increased by 6.3% year-on-year. The retail fuel volume side, this has gone up by 11.2% year-on-year and by 4.9% in the third quarter alone. This is a combination of new stations as well as the mobility restrictions in UAE going down significantly over the past couple of months. On the commercial side, fuel volumes were down 3% year-on-year, but this was mainly due to lower sales for strategic aviation customers. But on the corporate fuel volumes -- corporate side, the fuel volumes have decreased only marginally by approximately 0.9% year-on-year.Going to the non-fuel part of the business, the transactions have increased 4.3% year-on-year during the 9 months of 2021 and 5% year-on-year in the third quarter alone. Now this was driven by improved consumer sentiment as well as a combination of new stores that we've added onto our network. Also, the improved customer offering following the rehabilitation of our C-stores as well as the combination of marketing and promotion campaigns under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. All of this, of course, is to attract higher footfall and increase consumer customer spending.Now for the convenience store business, the average gross basket size has shown a decline of approximately 5.7% in the 9 months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. But this comes after a strong double-digit growth seen last year as a result of shifting consumer behavior during the pandemic. Now after the normalization of this trend in 2021, we still see the basket size very high compared to levels that we saw in 2019 that was pre-pandemic, of course.Moving on to gross profit performance by segment. The 9-month 2021 gross profit has declined by 10% year-on-year. Now as I had mentioned before, this is mainly due to retail fuel business gross profit, which decreased almost by 21% year-on-year due to lower margins. Now as you will recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of 2020. This was a result of stable retail pump prices despite the significant volatility and decline in oil prices as well as the cost of goods sold from our side, from ADNOC distribution.Now this has started to normalize this February that stability at the pump despite oil prices has been removed and the retail pump prices completely follow the movement in oil prices now. This has been now --this support that has gone away, has been partially offset by volume growth and inventory gains of approximately USD 73 million.On the non-fuel retail gross profit side, this increased by 18% year-on-year in the first 5 months of 2021. Again, an increase in the number of non-fuel transactions as well as an overall improvement in the margins. Now on the convenience store side, while the revenues increased by almost 4% year-on-year, the gross profit increased by almost 19% year-on-year. Now this is part of our strategy, which is to optimize the product mix, which results in sales of high-margin products, fresh foods and coffees, also, alongside a decrease in sales of low margin products, such as telecom card.On the commercial side, the business gross profit has increased by 10%, again driven by higher-margin per liter in the corporate part of the business. This was partially offset by lower fuel volumes. While in the 9 months of last year, we were negatively impacted by one-off items of around USD 10 million.Looking at the segment-wise EBITDA performance, 9-month 2021 EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, again driven by higher retail fuel volumes. The non-fuel part of the business recovering nicely, higher inventory gains for the 9 months of the year, increased operational efficiency and lower negative one-off items.Now 9 months in comparison of last year had negative one-offs of USD 142 million. On the retail part of the business, the EBITDA has declined almost 16% year-on-year due to lower gross profit margin in fuel retail. But we're seeing continued improvement in the underlying performance. Higher fuel volumes, we're selling more fuel, non-fuel business growth, as I just discussed, inventory gains as well as significant reduction in our operating expenditure.On the commercial side, the EBITDA has grown by 41% year-on-year, again driven by higher-margin per liter in the corporate business, lower operating expenditure, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. Now 9 months of 2020 last year also on the commercial EBITDA side included negative one-offs.Let's talk about the operating expenditure update. First 5 months of the year, we're pleased to announce that we have exceeded our annual target of USD 25 million in light for light operating expenditure savings. So we've exceeded 25 and landed on USD 26 million OpEx savings as of 9 months 2021.Now this reduction in the like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimization and staffing costs, which of course, makes up a major part of our total OpEx. If you look at the total OpEx, it significantly decreased by 14% year-on-year in the 9 months of this year, whereas our cash OpEx has decreased by almost 18% year-on-year.Now this is a result of our extreme focus in scrutiny on prudent cost controls and significant number of initiatives to increase their efficiencies across every single line of the business. This will continue going forward. So our transformation efforts will ensure that operating costs are market competitive and a company remains well positioned to deliver our future growth ambitions.Let's look at the cash position. We've generated free cash flow of USD 484 million in the 9 months of this year, again driven by robust cash flow from our operations part of the business, in line with our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we spent capital expenditure of USD 126 million in the 9 months of the year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the 9 months of this year, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.71. This, of course, is well below the 2x as per our commitment to the market. Our solid balance sheet position offers sufficient room to continue to grow our business while sustaining our progressive dividend policy.So I'll pause here at this point and hand it back over to Bader."

We definitely have the right attention there.As highlighted earlier, in the first 9 months of this year, we've definitely doubled our stations there. Since to start with today activity on stations in the Emirate. I think the point to emphasize upon is that what counts in Dubai is strategic key, key locations. And that's what we've been focusing on, talking to strategic partners within the Emirate, getting access to prime locations, and that's what we prioritize to develop first.Having said that, we've already shared with you. We've already have 10 stations in advanced stage of execution, and we have also additional 12 stations that have achieved full permits that are now moving into execution as well. So at least there's 22 stations that are heading towards execution, and that's a substantial amount of stations that we are currently pursuing in the emirates of Dubai. So very bullish, very focused and very determined to increase our market share there, and we've already grown that business quite substantially in the past period.Turning to the decarbonization topic. Of course, we are very aware and very committed. And you've seen our ESG report, and we've already taken significant strides in this direction, looking at the energy transition and looking at the next mobility solutions, which are out there. Of course, EV comes as one of the technologies that are advancing quite fast, if I may. I mean, this is -- the rate of adaptation is and conversion is increasing, and we are working on our strategy.And we feel that I think distribution shouldn't lag behind on the contrary.

So I'm Athmane Benzerroug, the Chief Investor Relation Officer. Joining me today are Bader Lamki, our CEO; and Mohamed Al Hashimi, our CFO.So in today's call, I would cover the key highlights of the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. Our CEO will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update. Then our CFO will take you through the first 9 months operating and financial performance. We will then answer any questions --[Audio Gap]Okay. So before we begin, I will quickly reiterate our cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. So this presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Such statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For more information, please refer to the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available in on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of the disclaimer and other important information.So I will now go through the summary of the company's key achievements in the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. So in 9M 2021, ADNOC distribution demonstrated a resilient operating and financial performance. 2021 reported 9M EBITDA net profit increased by 6.2% and 6.3% respectively compared to last year.Total fuel volume and non-fuel transactions continue to improve, and we have witnessed encouraging results, especially since September. This improvement is underpinned by a positive consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE, further ease in mobility restrictions such as 100% government employees returning back to offices. So this improvement has also been supported by schools reopening for face-to-face learning as well as increase in international visitors coming into the UAE following ease in travel restrictions. We are also pleased to see solid progress achieved on reducing operating costs.In 9M 2021, the company already exceeded its annual cost optimization target of $25 million by achieving $26 million like-for-like OpEx savings. We remain focused on executing our smart growth strategy with solid pipeline in both domestic and international markets. We opened actually 40 new stations in the UAE. In Dubai, we opened 5 new stations with 10 stations in execution and 12 stations approved for development. We opened 16 new convenience stores and refurbished 35 convenience stores to offer an enhanced shopping experience to our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish 40 to 60 stores.Regarding the international markets. We added 10 new stations in Saudi Arabia, taking our network to 12 stations and many more are in progress to be integrated into our network shortly. This is a major milestone that solidifies our commitment to expand in international markets. We are on track to open 40 to 45 new stations in Saudi Arabia this year.Lastly, ADNOC distribution is committed to deliver attractive long-term returns to its shareholders underpinned by a solid business model and cash flows, strength in its financial position, and strong growth potential following for setting a progressive policy that heeds high visibility of cash returns. You can see on the right side of this slide our dividend policy for 2021, 2022 and in the long-term. We already paid $300 million -- $350 million, sorry, cash dividend for the first half of this year in October and expect to pay a cash dividend of $350 million for the second half of this year in April 2022, subject to the Board and shareholders' approval.Lastly, from a trading perspective, I would highlight that ADNOC distribution saw a significant increase in share liquidity after key milestone we achieved. First of all, free flow doubled to 20% in September 2020 and to 23% in May 2021 following placements from our major shareholder ADNOC. Secondly, ADNOC distribution shares were included in MSCI EM index in May and in FTSE EM index in September. Inclusion in major indices would further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into our shares.Finally, we are committed to long-term sustainability of our business by contributing positively to environment, society and effectively managing governance risks. Recognizing our efforts and approach, ADNOC distribution received a rating A in the MSCI ESG Rating assessment in Q3 2021.I will now hand over the call to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Bader."

I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to re",1055,"Thank you, Athmane. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our operation and our people, which remains our key priority at all times. In its continued dedication to upholding the highest standards of health and safety, the company has ensured that 100% of its frontline employees working at the service stations have received their vaccination booster dose, an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to support the nationwide ongoing recovery and return to normalization.Talking about our strategy, I'll begin with the first key pillar of our growth, namely the fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. The company continues to see steady and progressive recovery. September, total fuel volumes increased by approximately 11% compared to August. It is expected that these volumes will continue to increase going into the fourth quarter as holiday season continues within the UAE hosts -- as well as the UAE hosting major international events, including Expo 2020.In addition, the company has continued to gain market share in Dubai driven by new stations, doubling its September fuel volumes compared to the same period of last year. Strong volume growth in Dubai is a testament to the progress that has been made on the domestic growth strategy. Our domestic fuel network has grown by 10% compared to the first 9 months of 2020, with the addition of 14 new stations in the first 9 months of this year. We maintain a leading market position in the UAE's retail fuel sector and now we are proudly operating 459 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of September 2021.In the first 9 months of this year, we have opened 5 new stations in Dubai. Our stations network in this particular emirate has doubled to 31 stations at the end of the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period of 2020. Dubai offers high-growth potential for the company to gain market share and is at the heart of our smart growth strategy. Our focus will remain -- remains on high-quality strategic locations in Dubai. There are currently 10 stations in various stages of execution with additional pipeline of 12 more stations already approved for further development.Beyond the growth in the UAE, international expansion remains integral part of our growth plans. You will recall, we announced 3 definitive agreements signed in December 2020 and February 2021 to acquire a total of 35 service stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Of these, 3 have added into our network as of 8 of November.In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have added 7 new stations in the Kingdom as of the 8 of November as well, through leasing sites, both greenfields as well as existing assets. This is just the beginning of our growth journey in international market, and we are advancing on our plans to realize international growth opportunities, including Egypt and other markets.Finally, we are also focused to drive growth in our commercial business through proactive sales strategy focusing on increasing customer base, growing our LPG sales and ADNOC Voyager lubricants export sales. We saw higher profitability in LPG business in the first 9 months of this year after announcing a hike in the cylinders price last year. We are now working on further optimization of our LPG distribution model to enhance customers' experience and grow our sales. In the third quarter of 2021, we have added new distributors for ADNOC Lube business, which is now exported to 19 countries around the world.Moving to the second pillar of our growth strategy, namely the non-fuel retail business, we have continued to deliver on our vision to bring modern, digitally-enabled, retail convenience experience to our customers and our communities. We have opened 16 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first 9 months of this year, increasing our network by 14% year-on-year to 342 C-stores.After strong momentum in 2020, the pace of convenience stores, the rehabitation -- reinnovation program has continued in the first 9 months, and we have refurbished to date 35 convenience stores. We have made considerable progress to offer a wider product offering to our customers with an improved category management. Larger part of our network now offers fresh food and a Barista coffee service.We have also maintained our focus to provide an increased level of convenience stores and services to our customers through online delivery service and providing special product shelves in our stores. On the back of these initiatives, we have witnessed positive results in our convenience store business with the growth in transaction and improved profitability.Lastly, we are also expanding other non-fuel services, such as vehicle inspection and car wash centers, thereby supporting our growth in the first 9 months of 2021. We continue to look at more options and further expansion in the non-fuel business services in other locations within our operations.Customer experience remains at the heart of our growth plans and a key differentiator to add more value to every visit our customers makes at our stations. A number of offers and promotions campaigns were activated in stores and in stations aiming to offer a range of incentives that meet a wide range of customers' taste and interests.Our ADNOC reward program, which was the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider, continue to grow in the first 9 months of this year.

We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forwa",1334,"Thank you. Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forward on our growth plans and maintaining a strong balance sheet.Our revenues have increased by 22.6%. This is compared to the same period as of last year. This was driven by higher selling prices, higher -- resulting from higher crude oil prices as well as retail fuel volume growth and recovery in non-fuel revenues. Our gross profit has declined by approximately 10.1% compared to the same period as of last year. This was mainly due to lower retail fuel business gross margin. Now when we get to the business-wise performance in the next couple of slides, we will elaborate on this further.The reported EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, standing at USD 617 million, and this was driven by improved operating performance. The underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory gains, losses and any other one-offs, shows a decrease of approximately 21% for the 9 months of this year compared to the 9 months of last year. Again, this was mainly due to the lower retail fuel margins.But if we exclude the high base effect of exceptional retail fuel margins last year, the company's demonstrated improvement in the operating performance, including growth in retail fuel volumes, growth in non-fuel transactions, the margin improving in non-fuel and both commercial businesses, and increasingly enhanced operating cost efficiencies. So for the 9 months of 2021, our net profit was USD 458 million. This is an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year, of course, driven by higher EBITDA.Let's look at the key operating highlights for 9 months of this year. The total fuel volumes have increased by 6.3% year-on-year. The retail fuel volume side, this has gone up by 11.2% year-on-year and by 4.9% in the third quarter alone. This is a combination of new stations as well as the mobility restrictions in UAE going down significantly over the past couple of months.On the commercial side, fuel volumes were down 3% year-on-year, but this was mainly due to lower sales for strategic aviation customers. But on the corporate fuel volumes -- corporate side, the fuel volumes have decreased only marginally by approximately 0.9% year-on-year.Going to the non-fuel part of the business, the transactions have increased 4.3% year-on-year during the 9 months of 2021 and 5% year-on-year in the third quarter alone. Now this was driven by improved consumer sentiment as well as a combination of new stores that we've added onto our network. Also the improved customer offering following the rehabilitation of our C-stores as well as the combination of marketing and promotion campaigns under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. All of this, of course, is to attract higher footfall and increase consumer -- customer spending.Now for the convenience store business, the average gross basket size has shown a decline of approximately 5.7% in the 9 months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. But this comes after a strong double-digit growth seen last year as a result of shifting consumer behavior during the pandemic. Now after the normalization of this trend in 2021, we still see the basket size very high compared to levels that we saw in 2019 that was pre-pandemic, of course.Moving on to gross profit performance by segment. The 9-month 2021 gross profit has declined by 10% year-on-year. Now as I had mentioned before, this is mainly due to retail fuel business gross profit, which decreased almost by 21% year-on-year due to lower margins. Now as you will recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of 2020. This was a result of stable retail pump prices despite the significant volatility and decline in oil prices as well as the cost of goods sold from our side, from ADNOC Distribution.Now this has started to normalize this February. That stability at the pump despite oil prices has been removed and the retail pump prices completely follow the movement in oil prices now. This has been now -- this support that has gone away has been partially offset by volume growth and inventory gains of approximately USD 73 million.On the non-fuel retail gross profit side, this increased by 18% year-on-year in the first 9 months of 2021. Again, an increase in the number of non-fuel transactions as well as an overall improvement in the margins. Now on the convenience store side, while the revenues increased by almost 4% year-on-year, the gross profit increased by almost 19% year-on-year. Now this is part of our strategy, which is to optimize the product mix, which results in sales of high-margin products, fresh foods and coffees, also alongside a decrease in sales of low margin products such as telecom card.On the commercial side, the business gross profit has increased by 10%, again driven by higher margin per liter in the corporate part of the business. This was partially offset by lower fuel volumes. While in the 9 months of last year, we were negatively impacted by one-off items of around USD 10 million.Looking at the segment-wise EBITDA performance, 9-month 2021 EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, again driven by higher retail fuel volumes, the non-fuel part of the business recovering nicely, higher inventory gains for the 9 months of the year, increased operational efficiency and lower negative one-off items. Now 9 months in comparison of last year had negative one-offs of USD 142 million.On the retail part of the business, the EBITDA has declined almost 16% year-on-year due to lower gross profit margin in fuel retail. But we're seeing continued improvement in the underlying performance. Higher fuel volumes, we're selling more fuel; non-fuel business growth, as I just discussed; inventory gains; as well as significant reduction in our operating expenditure.On the commercial side, the EBITDA has grown by 41% year-on-year, again driven by higher-margin per liter in the corporate business, lower operating expenditure, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. Now 9 months of 2020 last year also on the commercial EBITDA side included negative one-offs.Let's talk about the operating expenditure update. First 9 months of the year, we're pleased to announce that we have exceeded our annual target of USD 25 million in like for like operating expenditure savings. So we've exceeded USD 25 million and landed on USD 26 million OpEx savings as of 9 months 2021.Now this reduction in the like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimization and staffing costs, which of course makes up a major part of our total OpEx. If you look at the total OpEx, it significantly decreased by 14% year-on-year in the 9 months of this year whereas our cash OpEx has decreased by almost 18% year-on-year.Now this is a result of our extreme focus in scrutiny on prudent cost controls and significant number of initiatives to increase our efficiencies across every single line of the business. This will continue going forward. So our transformation efforts will ensure that operating costs are market competitive and that company remains well positioned to deliver our future growth ambitions.Let's look at the cash position. We've generated free cash flow of USD 484 million in the 9 months of this year, again driven by robust cash flow from our operations part of the business. In line with our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we spent capital expenditure of USD 126 million in the 9 months of the year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the 9 months of this year, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.71. This, of course, is well below the 2x as per our commitment to the market. Our solid balance sheet position offers sufficient room to continue to grow our business while sustaining our progressive dividend policy.So I'll pause here at this point and hand it back over to Bader."

We have a focused, a dedicated team that's looking after Dubai. We definitely have the right attention there.As highlighted earlier, in the first 9 months of this year, we've definitely doubled our stations there. Since to start with today at 31 stations in the Emirate. I think the point to emphasize upon is that what counts in Dubai is strategic key locations. And that's what we've been focusing on, talking to strategic partners within the Emirate, getting access to prime locations, and that's what we prioritize to develop first.Having said that, we've already shared with you we already have 10 stations in advanced stage of execution, and we have also additional 12 stations that have achieved full permits that are now moving into execution as well. So at least there's 22 stations that are heading towards execution, and that's a substantial amount of stations that we are currently pursuing in the emirates of Dubai. So very bullish, very focused and very determined to increase our market share there, and we've already grown that business quite substantially in the past period.Turning to the decarbonization topic. Of course, we are very aware and very committed. And you've seen our ESG report, and we've already taken significant strides in this direction, looking at the energy transition and looking at the next mobility solutions, which are out there. Of course, EV comes as one of the technologies that are advancing quite fast, if I may. I mean, this is -- the rate of adaptation is and conversion is increasing, and we are working on our strategy.And we feel that I think distribution shouldn't lag behind. On the contrary, our strategy is now in an advanced stage to formulate exactly the model that we may play in this space. But we want to be part of the solution, and we are committed also to support the energy transition and also the decarbonization of the economy, yes.One other point to add. Internally, within ADNOC Distribution, we've recently established a sustainability committee that we look at the pan company-wide sustainability initiatives. This will not stop at only energy, but also water, waste. We are looking at also engaging some solar solutions at our service stations to reduce our carbon footprint and also contribute to the decarbonization of the economy, the nation here.I've made also a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. And we are playing our part and the sustainability committee within ADNOC Distribution will formulate a cohesive and comprehensive strategy and targets that we will definitely, once with mature and advance, communicate with you as well and to the market. So very, very much interested, not only as an institution, but me personally as well. Having my background coming from also the [indiscernible] dealing with renewables and decarbonisation for many years. I do have that conviction, and we will definitely finalize our internal deliberation and setting of targets and communicate those in due course with the market."

We've also -- as my colleague, Athmane just mentioned, we are part of a broader global agreement between our Anchor shareholder and EWEC providing cleaner source of energy to satisfy our electricity needs at the station, and we are part of that umbrella agreement, which definitely sees green electrons from nuclear sources and renewable sources, namely solar coming to our stations, which again a serious step forward in the decarbonization agenda that we have.Now to the -- if your question is about the supply chain, and there's something else that you intend to play in that role. At the moment, there's no visibility that I can't share with you. And I'm hesitant to respond to something that I've not fully understood. So -- but at least, I hope my answer is -- gives you that clarity. EV decarbonization through the global agreement is there. Value chain optimization and decarbonization is a step forward, but we are not there yet.Nick -- sorry, Nick, just -- the last thing I want to just add is regarding the fact that we have advanced capabilities to offer actually low-emission natural gas for vehicles, so in JV. So the company today operates 31 service stations with CNG fueling capacity, and we continue to increase our offering across our network. It's just something I wanted to highlight."

We are in discussion with ADNOC obviously, and we will update the market on this backstop. I guess what is really important, Shashank, is to be in mind that ADNOC Distribution benefits from very high margins, I would say, secured margins since end of mid-2015, I would say like [indiscernible].So I would say that the regulatory framework is very strong and attractive for players like us, given the fact that we are providing the level of service that the government is expecting from us, and we don't see any reason to not have this kind of, level of margins going forward.And I'll just repeat what we said already in Q1 and Q2, we still believe that given the fact that since August 2015, when the new regulatory framework has been unveiled, we did not have any inflation adjustment on our margins, and we have told the market that, obviously, we are and will continue to chase for higher margins going forward."

So in today's call, I would cover the key highlights of the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. Our CEO will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update. Then our CFO will take you through the first 9 months operating and financial performance. We will then answer any questions --
[Audio Gap]
Okay. So before we begin, I will quickly reiterate our cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. So this presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Such statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For more information, please refer to the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available in on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of the disclaimer and other important information.
So I will now go through the summary of the company's key achievements in the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. So in 9M 2021, ADNOC distribution demonstrated a resilient operating and financial performance. 2021 reported 9M EBITDA net profit increased by 6.2% and 6.3% respectively compared to last year.
Total fuel volume and non-fuel transactions continue to improve, and we have witnessed encouraging results, especially since September. This improvement is underpinned by a positive consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE, further ease in mobility restrictions such as 100% government employees returning back to offices. So this improvement has also been supported by schools reopening for face-to-face learning as well as increase in international visitors coming into the UAE following ease in travel restrictions. We are also pleased to see solid progress achieved on reducing operating costs.
In 9M 2021, the company already exceeded its annual cost optimization target of $25 million by achieving $26 million like-for-like OpEx savings. We remain focused on executing our smart growth strategy with solid pipeline in both domestic and international markets. We opened actually 40 new stations in the UAE. In Dubai, we opened 5 new stations with 10 stations in execution and 12 stations approved for development. We opened 16 new convenience stores and refurbished 35 convenience stores to offer an enhanced shopping experience to our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish 40 to 60 stores.
Regarding the international markets. We added 10 new stations in Saudi Arabia, taking our network to 12 stations and many more are in progress to be integrated into our network shortly. This is a major milestone that solidifies our commitment to expand in international markets. We are on track to open 40 to 45 new stations in Saudi Arabia this year.
Lastly, ADNOC distribution is committed to deliver attractive long-term returns to its shareholders underpinned by a solid business model and cash flows, strength in its financial position, and strong growth potential following for setting a progressive policy that heeds high visibility of cash returns. You can see on the right side of this slide our dividend policy for 2021, 2022 and in the long-term. We already paid $300 million -- $350 million, sorry, cash dividend for the first half of this year in October and expect to pay a cash dividend of $350 million for the second half of this year in April 2022, subject to the Board and shareholders' approval.
Lastly, from a trading perspective, I would highlight that ADNOC distribution saw a significant increase in share liquidity after key milestone we achieved. First of all, free flow doubled to 20% in September 2020 and to 23% in May 2021 following placements from our major shareholder ADNOC. Secondly, ADNOC distribution shares were included in MSCI EM index in May and in FTSE EM index in September. Inclusion in major indices would further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into our shares.
Finally, we are committed to long-term sustainability of our business by contributing positively to environment, society and effectively managing governance risks. Recognizing our efforts and approach, ADNOC distribution received a rating A in the MSCI ESG Rating assessment in Q3 2021.
I will now hand over the call to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Bader."

Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to",1071,"Thank you, Athmane. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.
Before I do so, I would like to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our operation and our people, which remains our key priority at all times. In its continued dedication to upholding the highest standards of health and safety, the company has ensured that 100% of its frontline employees working at the service stations have received their vaccination booster dose, an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to support the nationwide ongoing recovery and return to normalization.
Talking about our strategy, I'll begin with the first key pillar of our growth, namely the fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. The company continues to see steady and progressive recovery. September, total fuel volumes increased by approximately 11% compared to August. It is expected that these volumes will continue to increase going into the fourth quarter as holiday season continues within the UAE hosts -- as well as the UAE hosting major international events, including Expo 2020.
In addition, the company has continued to gain market share in Dubai driven by new stations, doubling its September fuel volumes compared to the same period of last year. Strong volume growth in Dubai is a testament to the progress that has been made on the domestic growth strategy. Our domestic fuel network has grown by 10% compared to the first 9 months of 2020, with the addition of 14 new stations in the first 9 months of this year. We maintain a leading market position in the UAE's retail fuel sector and now we are proudly operating 459 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of September 2021.
In the first 9 months of this year, we have opened 5 new stations in Dubai. Our stations network in this particular emirate has doubled to 31 stations at the end of the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period of 2020. Dubai offers high-growth potential for the company to gain market share and is at the heart of our smart growth strategy. Our focus will remain -- remains on high-quality strategic locations in Dubai. There are currently 10 stations in various stages of execution with additional pipeline of 12 more stations already approved for further development.
Beyond the growth in the UAE, international expansion remains integral part of our growth plans. You will recall, we announced 3 definitive agreements signed in December 2020 and February 2021 to acquire a total of 35 service stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Of these, 3 have added into our network as of 8 of November.
In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have added 7 new stations in the Kingdom as of the 8 of November as well, through leasing sites, both greenfields as well as existing assets. This is just the beginning of our growth journey in international market, and we are advancing on our plans to realize international growth opportunities, including Egypt and other markets.
Finally, we are also focused to drive growth in our commercial business through proactive sales strategy focusing on increasing customer base, growing our LPG sales and ADNOC Voyager lubricants export sales. We saw higher profitability in LPG business in the first 9 months of this year after announcing a hike in the cylinders price last year. We are now working on further optimization of our LPG distribution model to enhance customers' experience and grow our sales. In the third quarter of 2021, we have added new distributors for ADNOC Lube business, which is now exported to 19 countries around the world.
Moving to the second pillar of our growth strategy, namely the non-fuel retail business, we have continued to deliver on our vision to bring modern, digitally-enabled, retail convenience experience to our customers and our communities. We have opened 16 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first 9 months of this year, increasing our network by 14% year-on-year to 342 C-stores.
After strong momentum in 2020, the pace of convenience stores, the rehabitation -- reinnovation program has continued in the first 9 months, and we have refurbished to date 35 convenience stores. We have made considerable progress to offer a wider product offering to our customers with an improved category management. Larger part of our network now offers fresh food and a Barista coffee service.
We have also maintained our focus to provide an increased level of convenience stores and services to our customers through online delivery service and providing special product shelves in our stores. On the back of these initiatives, we have witnessed positive results in our convenience store business with the growth in transaction and improved profitability.
Lastly, we are also expanding other non-fuel services, such as vehicle inspection and car wash centers, thereby supporting our growth in the first 9 months of 2021. We continue to look at more options and further expansion in the non-fuel business services in other locations within our operations.
Customer experience remains at the heart of our growth plans and a key differentiator to add more value to every visit our customers makes at our stations. A number of offers and promotions campaigns were activated in stores and in stations aiming to offer a range of incentives that meet a wide range of customers' taste and interests.
Our ADNOC reward program, which was the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider, continue to grow in the first 9 months of this year. We have now over 1.2 million loyalty members, which represents a 20% increase compared to end of 2020 and recorded 23.5 million transactions since the launch of the program.
We have launched new partnerships with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms to cross exchange points and maximize benefits. We have also now 39 partners offering memberships, even more deals and discounts from some of the UAE's best leisure and entertainment brands.
During Q3 of 2021, we have launched a series of promotions throughout the quarter, including the Let's Go Shop and Win Raffle, which shows 16 million entries over the 3 months campaign period.
I will now hand over to Mohamed to present the highlights of the financial performance."

We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forwa",1353,"Thank you. Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forward on our growth plans and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our revenues have increased by 22.6%. This is compared to the same period as of last year. This was driven by higher selling prices, higher -- resulting from higher crude oil prices as well as retail fuel volume growth and recovery in non-fuel revenues. Our gross profit has declined by approximately 10.1% compared to the same period as of last year. This was mainly due to lower retail fuel business gross margin. Now when we get to the business-wise performance in the next couple of slides, we will elaborate on this further.
The reported EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, standing at USD 617 million, and this was driven by improved operating performance. The underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory gains, losses and any other one-offs, shows a decrease of approximately 21% for the 9 months of this year compared to the 9 months of last year. Again, this was mainly due to the lower retail fuel margins.
But if we exclude the high base effect of exceptional retail fuel margins last year, the company's demonstrated improvement in the operating performance, including growth in retail fuel volumes, growth in non-fuel transactions, the margin improving in non-fuel and both commercial businesses, and increasingly enhanced operating cost efficiencies. So for the 9 months of 2021, our net profit was USD 458 million. This is an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year, of course, driven by higher EBITDA.
Let's look at the key operating highlights for 9 months of this year. The total fuel volumes have increased by 6.3% year-on-year. The retail fuel volume side, this has gone up by 11.2% year-on-year and by 4.9% in the third quarter alone. This is a combination of new stations as well as the mobility restrictions in UAE going down significantly over the past couple of months.
On the commercial side, fuel volumes were down 3% year-on-year, but this was mainly due to lower sales for strategic aviation customers. But on the corporate fuel volumes -- corporate side, the fuel volumes have decreased only marginally by approximately 0.9% year-on-year.
Going to the non-fuel part of the business, the transactions have increased 4.3% year-on-year during the 9 months of 2021 and 5% year-on-year in the third quarter alone. Now this was driven by improved consumer sentiment as well as a combination of new stores that we've added onto our network. Also the improved customer offering following the rehabilitation of our C-stores as well as the combination of marketing and promotion campaigns under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. All of this, of course, is to attract higher footfall and increase consumer -- customer spending.
Now for the convenience store business, the average gross basket size has shown a decline of approximately 5.7% in the 9 months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. But this comes after a strong double-digit growth seen last year as a result of shifting consumer behavior during the pandemic. Now after the normalization of this trend in 2021, we still see the basket size very high compared to levels that we saw in 2019 that was pre-pandemic, of course.
Moving on to gross profit performance by segment. The 9-month 2021 gross profit has declined by 10% year-on-year. Now as I had mentioned before, this is mainly due to retail fuel business gross profit, which decreased almost by 21% year-on-year due to lower margins. Now as you will recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of 2020. This was a result of stable retail pump prices despite the significant volatility and decline in oil prices as well as the cost of goods sold from our side, from ADNOC Distribution.
Now this has started to normalize this February. That stability at the pump despite oil prices has been removed and the retail pump prices completely follow the movement in oil prices now. This has been now -- this support that has gone away has been partially offset by volume growth and inventory gains of approximately USD 73 million.
On the non-fuel retail gross profit side, this increased by 18% year-on-year in the first 9 months of 2021. Again, an increase in the number of non-fuel transactions as well as an overall improvement in the margins. Now on the convenience store side, while the revenues increased by almost 4% year-on-year, the gross profit increased by almost 19% year-on-year. Now this is part of our strategy, which is to optimize the product mix, which results in sales of high-margin products, fresh foods and coffees, also alongside a decrease in sales of low margin products such as telecom card.
On the commercial side, the business gross profit has increased by 10%, again driven by higher margin per liter in the corporate part of the business. This was partially offset by lower fuel volumes. While in the 9 months of last year, we were negatively impacted by one-off items of around USD 10 million.
Looking at the segment-wise EBITDA performance, 9-month 2021 EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, again driven by higher retail fuel volumes, the non-fuel part of the business recovering nicely, higher inventory gains for the 9 months of the year, increased operational efficiency and lower negative one-off items. Now 9 months in comparison of last year had negative one-offs of USD 142 million.
On the retail part of the business, the EBITDA has declined almost 16% year-on-year due to lower gross profit margin in fuel retail. But we're seeing continued improvement in the underlying performance. Higher fuel volumes, we're selling more fuel; non-fuel business growth, as I just discussed; inventory gains; as well as significant reduction in our operating expenditure.
On the commercial side, the EBITDA has grown by 41% year-on-year, again driven by higher-margin per liter in the corporate business, lower operating expenditure, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. Now 9 months of 2020 last year also on the commercial EBITDA side included negative one-offs.
Let's talk about the operating expenditure update. First 9 months of the year, we're pleased to announce that we have exceeded our annual target of USD 25 million in like for like operating expenditure savings. So we've exceeded USD 25 million and landed on USD 26 million OpEx savings as of 9 months 2021.
Now this reduction in the like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimization and staffing costs, which of course makes up a major part of our total OpEx. If you look at the total OpEx, it significantly decreased by 14% year-on-year in the 9 months of this year whereas our cash OpEx has decreased by almost 18% year-on-year.
Now this is a result of our extreme focus in scrutiny on prudent cost controls and significant number of initiatives to increase our efficiencies across every single line of the business. This will continue going forward. So our transformation efforts will ensure that operating costs are market competitive and that company remains well positioned to deliver our future growth ambitions.
Let's look at the cash position. We've generated free cash flow of USD 484 million in the 9 months of this year, again driven by robust cash flow from our operations part of the business. In line with our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we spent capital expenditure of USD 126 million in the 9 months of the year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the 9 months of this year, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.71. This, of course, is well below the 2x as per our commitment to the market. Our solid balance sheet position offers sufficient room to continue to grow our business while sustaining our progressive dividend policy.
So I'll pause here at this point and hand it back over to Bader."

This is Faisal Azmeh from Goldman Sachs. 3 questions, if I may, maybe just starting off with corporate volumes. It seems that they've peaked at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and then they've been softening since. Would be great if you can kind of shed some color on why that decline has been taking place despite the improvement in the economic activity that we've been witnessing so far this year?
And maybe if you can shed some color on what's happening in Dubai and the expansion there. Where are you and in terms of delivering on targets and what should we expect for next year? And how that would bridge into the 2023 EBITDA target that you have? And then finally, maybe on decarbonization, maybe if you can share your views on how you plan to reduce your carbon footprint. If you can provide us some color around what are the low hanging fruits? And if you see any costs associated with decarbonization across your platform?"

We have a focused, a dedicated team that's looking after Dubai. We definitely have the right attention there.
As highlighted earlier, in the first 9 months of this year, we've definitely doubled our stations there. Since to start with today at 31 stations in the Emirate. I think the point to emphasize upon is that what counts in Dubai is strategic key locations. And that's what we've been focusing on, talking to strategic partners within the Emirate, getting access to prime locations, and that's what we prioritize to develop first.
Having said that, we've already shared with you we already have 10 stations in advanced stage of execution, and we have also additional 12 stations that have achieved full permits that are now moving into execution as well. So at least there's 22 stations that are heading towards execution, and that's a substantial amount of stations that we are currently pursuing in the emirates of Dubai. So very bullish, very focused and very determined to increase our market share there, and we've already grown that business quite substantially in the past period.
Turning to the decarbonization topic. Of course, we are very aware and very committed. And you've seen our ESG report, and we've already taken significant strides in this direction, looking at the energy transition and looking at the next mobility solutions, which are out there. Of course, EV comes as one of the technologies that are advancing quite fast, if I may. I mean, this is -- the rate of adaptation is and conversion is increasing, and we are working on our strategy.
And we feel that I think distribution shouldn't lag behind. On the contrary, our strategy is now in an advanced stage to formulate exactly the model that we may play in this space. But we want to be part of the solution, and we are committed also to support the energy transition and also the decarbonization of the economy, yes.
One other point to add. Internally, within ADNOC Distribution, we've recently established a sustainability committee that we look at the pan company-wide sustainability initiatives. This will not stop at only energy, but also water, waste. We are looking at also engaging some solar solutions at our service stations to reduce our carbon footprint and also contribute to the decarbonization of the economy, the nation here.
I've made also a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. And we are playing our part and the sustainability committee within ADNOC Distribution will formulate a cohesive and comprehensive strategy and targets that we will definitely, once with mature and advance, communicate with you as well and to the market. So very, very much interested, not only as an institution, but me personally as well. Having my background coming from also the [indiscernible] dealing with renewables and decarbonization for many years. I do have that conviction, and we will definitely finalize our internal deliberation and setting of targets and communicate those in due course with the market."

I mean, that certainly makes it a little pressing to come up with an energy transition agenda. And one of the things I kind of like -- I mean, become skeptical around this model is that you have very high margins from the liquids. And in the majors, one of the kind of like key sort of like points they make is that having separation like across the electron value chain, which might give them some more like opportunity for them to like make a bit more money, if they go down by the EV routes. To which extent could you guys make something like similar?
And then the second question, I guess still on the same topic. BP and Aulton have formed a strategic partnership for clean energy. That's most like upstream and other like Let's Shop, but is this like a similar route you guys might take? I mean, are you considering making some sort of like partnership with BP or some other like partner to do that to move forward with that decarbonization plan?
And then finally, my social media picked up about you having a new CEO, Head of the Saudi kind of, like, business. I'm just wondering, how will you run it? Is this going to be like a separate business unit with its own budget and sort of, like I said, targets or are you guys like running in and it's more like from non-operational like nature, will kind of like you looking at it in the country?"

I mean, sorry, we had difficulty to understand all the 3 questions that you posed.

One, the 35 stations or so that have been approved and received the no objection from the authorities there. And those are underway to be operationalized. Two, we have opened a dedicated office in country in Al-Khobar, not too far from Aramco and our fuel supply, and we have a very strong base now in Al-Khobar. Yes, we've appointed a new country manager as well. So this is serious commitment. Office is opened, a country manager is there, a full team -- fully dedicated team have been mobilized there, covering the entire functions, where there is from business development, from support functions, finance, HR, fully independent, trying to really accelerate our ambition there.

And within the core business, which includes mobility, EV is the space that we want to mature our strategy and definitely take a noticeable and concrete steps into providing that mobility solution and offering to our customers. So that's what we're sure about and focused about. We've also -- as my colleague, Athmane just mentioned, we are part of a broader global agreement between our Anchor shareholder and EWEC providing cleaner source of energy to satisfy our electricity needs at the station, and we are part of that umbrella agreement, which definitely sees green electrons from nuclear sources and renewable sources, namely solar coming to our stations, which again a serious step forward in the decarbonization agenda that we have.
Now to the -- if your question is about the supply chain, and there's something else that you intend to play in that role. At the moment, there's no visibility that I can't share with you. And I'm hesitant to respond to something that I've not fully understood. So -- but at least, I hope my answer is -- gives you that clarity. EV decarbonization through the global agreement is there. Value chain optimization and decarbonization is a step forward, but we are not there yet.
Nick -- sorry, Nick, just -- the last thing I want to just add is regarding the fact that we have advanced capabilities to offer actually low-emission natural gas for vehicles, so in JV. So the company today operates 31 service stations with CNG fueling capacity, and we continue to increase our offering across our network. It's just something I wanted to highlight."

So I'm Athmane Benzerroug, the Chief Investor Relation Officer. Joining me today are Bader Lamki, our CEO; and Mohamed Al Hashimi, our CFO.
So in today's call, I would cover the key highlights of the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. Our CEO will then discuss in detail our growth strategy update. Then our CFO will take you through the first 9 months operating and financial performance. We will then answer any questions --
[Audio Gap]
Okay. So before we begin, I will quickly reiterate our cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. So this presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business. Such statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For more information, please refer to the international offering memorandum relating to our IPO and in our other investor communications, all of which are available in on our website. I direct everyone to our website to read the full text of the disclaimer and other important information.
So I will now go through the summary of the company's key achievements in the first 9 months of the year and the outlook. So in 9M 2021, ADNOC distribution demonstrated a resilient operating and financial performance. 2021 reported 9M EBITDA net profit increased by 6.2% and 6.3% respectively compared to last year.
Total fuel volume and non-fuel transactions continue to improve, and we have witnessed encouraging results, especially since September. This improvement is underpinned by a positive consumer sentiment following the successful vaccination drive across the UAE, further ease in mobility restrictions such as 100% government employees returning back to offices. So this improvement has also been supported by schools reopening for face-to-face learning as well as increase in international visitors coming into the UAE following ease in travel restrictions. We are also pleased to see solid progress achieved on reducing operating costs.
In 9M 2021, the company already exceeded its annual cost optimization target of $25 million by achieving $26 million like-for-like OpEx savings. We remain focused on executing our smart growth strategy with solid pipeline in both domestic and international markets. We opened actually 40 new stations in the UAE. In Dubai, we opened 5 new stations with 10 stations in execution and 12 stations approved for development. We opened 16 new convenience stores and refurbished 35 convenience stores to offer an enhanced shopping experience to our customers. In 2021, we plan to refurbish 40 to 60 stores.
Regarding the international markets. We added 10 new stations in Saudi Arabia, taking our network to 12 stations and many more are in progress to be integrated into our network shortly. This is a major milestone that solidifies our commitment to expand in international markets. We are on track to open 40 to 45 new stations in Saudi Arabia this year.
Lastly, ADNOC distribution is committed to deliver attractive long-term returns to its shareholders underpinned by a solid business model and cash flows, strength in its financial position, and strong growth potential following for setting a progressive policy that heeds high visibility of cash returns. You can see on the right side of this slide our dividend policy for 2021, 2022 and in the long-term. We already paid $300 million -- $350 million, sorry, cash dividend for the first half of this year in October and expect to pay a cash dividend of $350 million for the second half of this year in April 2022, subject to the Board and shareholders' approval.
Lastly, from a trading perspective, I would highlight that ADNOC distribution saw a significant increase in share liquidity after key milestone we achieved. First of all, free flow doubled to 20% in September 2020 and to 23% in May 2021 following placements from our major shareholder ADNOC. Secondly, ADNOC distribution shares were included in MSCI EM index in May and in FTSE EM index in September. Inclusion in major indices would further enhance the company's investment appeal and visibility among global investors, attracting more foreign inflows into our shares.
Finally, we are committed to long-term sustainability of our business by contributing positively to environment, society and effectively managing governance risks. Recognizing our efforts and approach, ADNOC distribution received a rating A in the MSCI ESG Rating assessment in Q3 2021.
I will now hand over the call to our CEO, Bader Lamki, who will walk you through an update on our growth strategy. Over to you, Bader."

Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.Before I do so, I would like to",1071,"Thank you, Athmane. Good morning, good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will take you today through the progress we have made to achieve our growth plans laid out at the beginning of this year.
Before I do so, I would like to reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of our operation and our people, which remains our key priority at all times. In its continued dedication to upholding the highest standards of health and safety, the company has ensured that 100% of its frontline employees working at the service stations have received their vaccination booster dose, an incredible achievement as we continue in our commitment to support the nationwide ongoing recovery and return to normalization.
Talking about our strategy, I'll begin with the first key pillar of our growth, namely the fuel business, which includes retail and commercial. The company continues to see steady and progressive recovery. September, total fuel volumes increased by approximately 11% compared to August. It is expected that these volumes will continue to increase going into the fourth quarter as holiday season continues within the UAE hosts -- as well as the UAE hosting major international events, including Expo 2020.
In addition, the company has continued to gain market share in Dubai driven by new stations, doubling its September fuel volumes compared to the same period of last year. Strong volume growth in Dubai is a testament to the progress that has been made on the domestic growth strategy. Our domestic fuel network has grown by 10% compared to the first 9 months of 2020, with the addition of 14 new stations in the first 9 months of this year. We maintain a leading market position in the UAE's retail fuel sector and now we are proudly operating 459 fuel stations in UAE as of 30th of September 2021.
In the first 9 months of this year, we have opened 5 new stations in Dubai. Our stations network in this particular emirate has doubled to 31 stations at the end of the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period of 2020. Dubai offers high-growth potential for the company to gain market share and is at the heart of our smart growth strategy. Our focus will remain -- remains on high-quality strategic locations in Dubai. There are currently 10 stations in various stages of execution with additional pipeline of 12 more stations already approved for further development.
Beyond the growth in the UAE, international expansion remains integral part of our growth plans. You will recall, we announced 3 definitive agreements signed in December 2020 and February 2021 to acquire a total of 35 service stations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Of these, 3 have added into our network as of 8 of November.
In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have added 7 new stations in the Kingdom as of the 8 of November as well, through leasing sites, both greenfields as well as existing assets. This is just the beginning of our growth journey in international market, and we are advancing on our plans to realize international growth opportunities, including Egypt and other markets.
Finally, we are also focused to drive growth in our commercial business through proactive sales strategy focusing on increasing customer base, growing our LPG sales and ADNOC Voyager lubricants export sales. We saw higher profitability in LPG business in the first 9 months of this year after announcing a hike in the cylinders price last year. We are now working on further optimization of our LPG distribution model to enhance customers' experience and grow our sales. In the third quarter of 2021, we have added new distributors for ADNOC Lube business, which is now exported to 19 countries around the world.
Moving to the second pillar of our growth strategy, namely the non-fuel retail business, we have continued to deliver on our vision to bring modern, digitally-enabled, retail convenience experience to our customers and our communities. We have opened 16 new convenience stores in the United Arab Emirates in the first 9 months of this year, increasing our network by 14% year-on-year to 342 C-stores.
After strong momentum in 2020, the pace of convenience stores, the rehabitation -- reinnovation program has continued in the first 9 months, and we have refurbished to date 35 convenience stores. We have made considerable progress to offer a wider product offering to our customers with an improved category management. Larger part of our network now offers fresh food and a Barista coffee service.
We have also maintained our focus to provide an increased level of convenience stores and services to our customers through online delivery service and providing special product shelves in our stores. On the back of these initiatives, we have witnessed positive results in our convenience store business with the growth in transaction and improved profitability.
Lastly, we are also expanding other non-fuel services, such as vehicle inspection and car wash centers, thereby supporting our growth in the first 9 months of 2021. We continue to look at more options and further expansion in the non-fuel business services in other locations within our operations.
Customer experience remains at the heart of our growth plans and a key differentiator to add more value to every visit our customers makes at our stations. A number of offers and promotions campaigns were activated in stores and in stations aiming to offer a range of incentives that meet a wide range of customers' taste and interests.
Our ADNOC reward program, which was the UAE's first customer loyalty program from a fuel provider, continue to grow in the first 9 months of this year. We have now over 1.2 million loyalty members, which represents a 20% increase compared to end of 2020 and recorded 23.5 million transactions since the launch of the program.
We have launched new partnerships with Etisalat Smiles, which allows members of both platforms to cross exchange points and maximize benefits. We have also now 39 partners offering memberships, even more deals and discounts from some of the UAE's best leisure and entertainment brands.
During Q3 of 2021, we have launched a series of promotions throughout the quarter, including the Let's Go Shop and Win Raffle, which shows 16 million entries over the 3 months campaign period.
I will now hand over to Mohamed to present the highlights of the financial performance."

Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forwa",1353,"Thank you. Thank you, Bader. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. At this point, I'm going to take you to the financial performance for the 9 months of 2021. We've delivered a strong set of numbers during the period. At the same time, pushing forward on our growth plans and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Our revenues have increased by 22.6%. This is compared to the same period as of last year. This was driven by higher selling prices, higher -- resulting from higher crude oil prices as well as retail fuel volume growth and recovery in non-fuel revenues. Our gross profit has declined by approximately 10.1% compared to the same period as of last year. This was mainly due to lower retail fuel business gross margin. Now when we get to the business-wise performance in the next couple of slides, we will elaborate on this further.
The reported EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, standing at USD 617 million, and this was driven by improved operating performance. The underlying EBITDA, excluding inventory gains, losses and any other one-offs, shows a decrease of approximately 21% for the 9 months of this year compared to the 9 months of last year. Again, this was mainly due to the lower retail fuel margins.
But if we exclude the high base effect of exceptional retail fuel margins last year, the company's demonstrated improvement in the operating performance, including growth in retail fuel volumes, growth in non-fuel transactions, the margin improving in non-fuel and both commercial businesses, and increasingly enhanced operating cost efficiencies. So for the 9 months of 2021, our net profit was USD 458 million. This is an increase of 6.3% compared to the same period last year, of course, driven by higher EBITDA.
Let's look at the key operating highlights for 9 months of this year. The total fuel volumes have increased by 6.3% year-on-year. The retail fuel volume side, this has gone up by 11.2% year-on-year and by 4.9% in the third quarter alone. This is a combination of new stations as well as the mobility restrictions in UAE going down significantly over the past couple of months.
On the commercial side, fuel volumes were down 3% year-on-year, but this was mainly due to lower sales for strategic aviation customers. But on the corporate fuel volumes -- corporate side, the fuel volumes have decreased only marginally by approximately 0.9% year-on-year.
Going to the non-fuel part of the business, the transactions have increased 4.3% year-on-year during the 9 months of 2021 and 5% year-on-year in the third quarter alone. Now this was driven by improved consumer sentiment as well as a combination of new stores that we've added onto our network. Also the improved customer offering following the rehabilitation of our C-stores as well as the combination of marketing and promotion campaigns under the ADNOC Rewards loyalty program. All of this, of course, is to attract higher footfall and increase consumer -- customer spending.
Now for the convenience store business, the average gross basket size has shown a decline of approximately 5.7% in the 9 months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. But this comes after a strong double-digit growth seen last year as a result of shifting consumer behavior during the pandemic. Now after the normalization of this trend in 2021, we still see the basket size very high compared to levels that we saw in 2019 that was pre-pandemic, of course.
Moving on to gross profit performance by segment. The 9-month 2021 gross profit has declined by 10% year-on-year. Now as I had mentioned before, this is mainly due to retail fuel business gross profit, which decreased almost by 21% year-on-year due to lower margins. Now as you will recall, the fuel retail business gross profit margin was exceptionally high throughout the last 9 months of 2020. This was a result of stable retail pump prices despite the significant volatility and decline in oil prices as well as the cost of goods sold from our side, from ADNOC Distribution.
Now this has started to normalize this February. That stability at the pump despite oil prices has been removed and the retail pump prices completely follow the movement in oil prices now. This has been now -- this support that has gone away has been partially offset by volume growth and inventory gains of approximately USD 73 million.
On the non-fuel retail gross profit side, this increased by 18% year-on-year in the first 9 months of 2021. Again, an increase in the number of non-fuel transactions as well as an overall improvement in the margins. Now on the convenience store side, while the revenues increased by almost 4% year-on-year, the gross profit increased by almost 19% year-on-year. Now this is part of our strategy, which is to optimize the product mix, which results in sales of high-margin products, fresh foods and coffees, also alongside a decrease in sales of low margin products such as telecom card.
On the commercial side, the business gross profit has increased by 10%, again driven by higher margin per liter in the corporate part of the business. This was partially offset by lower fuel volumes. While in the 9 months of last year, we were negatively impacted by one-off items of around USD 10 million.
Looking at the segment-wise EBITDA performance, 9-month 2021 EBITDA has increased by 6.2%, again driven by higher retail fuel volumes, the non-fuel part of the business recovering nicely, higher inventory gains for the 9 months of the year, increased operational efficiency and lower negative one-off items. Now 9 months in comparison of last year had negative one-offs of USD 142 million.
On the retail part of the business, the EBITDA has declined almost 16% year-on-year due to lower gross profit margin in fuel retail. But we're seeing continued improvement in the underlying performance. Higher fuel volumes, we're selling more fuel; non-fuel business growth, as I just discussed; inventory gains; as well as significant reduction in our operating expenditure.
On the commercial side, the EBITDA has grown by 41% year-on-year, again driven by higher-margin per liter in the corporate business, lower operating expenditure, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. Now 9 months of 2020 last year also on the commercial EBITDA side included negative one-offs.
Let's talk about the operating expenditure update. First 9 months of the year, we're pleased to announce that we have exceeded our annual target of USD 25 million in like for like operating expenditure savings. So we've exceeded USD 25 million and landed on USD 26 million OpEx savings as of 9 months 2021.
Now this reduction in the like-for-like OpEx was mainly due to optimization and staffing costs, which of course makes up a major part of our total OpEx. If you look at the total OpEx, it significantly decreased by 14% year-on-year in the 9 months of this year whereas our cash OpEx has decreased by almost 18% year-on-year.
Now this is a result of our extreme focus in scrutiny on prudent cost controls and significant number of initiatives to increase our efficiencies across every single line of the business. This will continue going forward. So our transformation efforts will ensure that operating costs are market competitive and that company remains well positioned to deliver our future growth ambitions.
Let's look at the cash position. We've generated free cash flow of USD 484 million in the 9 months of this year, again driven by robust cash flow from our operations part of the business. In line with our plans to continue with our expansion strategy, we spent capital expenditure of USD 126 million in the 9 months of the year. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. At the end of the 9 months of this year, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.71. This, of course, is well below the 2x as per our commitment to the market. Our solid balance sheet position offers sufficient room to continue to grow our business while sustaining our progressive dividend policy.
So I'll pause here at this point and hand it back over to Bader."

We have a focused, a dedicated team that's looking after Dubai. We definitely have the right attention there.
As highlighted earlier, in the first 9 months of this year, we've definitely doubled our stations there. Since to start with today at 31 stations in the Emirate. I think the point to emphasize upon is that what counts in Dubai is strategic key locations. And that's what we've been focusing on, talking to strategic partners within the Emirate, getting access to prime locations, and that's what we prioritize to develop first.
Having said that, we've already shared with you we already have 10 stations in advanced stage of execution, and we have also additional 12 stations that have achieved full permits that are now moving into execution as well. So at least there's 22 stations that are heading towards execution, and that's a substantial amount of stations that we are currently pursuing in the emirates of Dubai. So very bullish, very focused and very determined to increase our market share there, and we've already grown that business quite substantially in the past period.
Turning to the decarbonization topic. Of course, we are very aware and very committed. And you've seen our ESG report, and we've already taken significant strides in this direction, looking at the energy transition and looking at the next mobility solutions, which are out there. Of course, EV comes as one of the technologies that are advancing quite fast, if I may. I mean, this is -- the rate of adaptation is and conversion is increasing, and we are working on our strategy.
And we feel that I think distribution shouldn't lag behind. On the contrary, our strategy is now in an advanced stage to formulate exactly the model that we may play in this space. But we want to be part of the solution, and we are committed also to support the energy transition and also the decarbonization of the economy, yes.
One other point to add. Internally, within ADNOC Distribution, we've recently established a sustainability committee that we look at the pan company-wide sustainability initiatives. This will not stop at only energy, but also water, waste. We are looking at also engaging some solar solutions at our service stations to reduce our carbon footprint and also contribute to the decarbonization of the economy, the nation here.
I've made also a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. And we are playing our part and the sustainability committee within ADNOC Distribution will formulate a cohesive and comprehensive strategy and targets that we will definitely, once with mature and advance, communicate with you as well and to the market. So very, very much interested, not only as an institution, but me personally as well. Having my background coming from also the [indiscernible] dealing with renewables and decarbonization for many years. I do have that conviction, and we will definitely finalize our internal deliberation and setting of targets and communicate those in due course with the market."

To which extent could you guys make something like similar?
And then the second question, I guess still on the same topic. BP and Aulton have formed a strategic partnership for clean energy. That's most like upstream and other like Let's Shop, but is this like a similar route you guys might take? I mean, are you considering making some sort of like partnership with BP or some other like partner to do that to move forward with that decarbonization plan?

One, the 35 stations or so that have been approved and received the no objection from the authorities there. And those are underway to be operationalized. Two, we have opened a dedicated office in country in Al-Khobar, not too far from Aramco and our fuel supply, and we have a very strong base now in Al-Khobar. Yes, we've appointed a new country manager as well. So this is serious commitment. Office is opened, a country manager is there, a full team -- fully dedicated team have been mobilized there, covering the entire functions, where there is from business development, from support functions, finance, HR, fully independent, trying to really accelerate our ambition there.

So ADNOC Distribution, us. So ADNOC Distribution electricity supply is also part of this group-wide milestone initiative, sorry, making ADNOC Distribution, one of the first fuel distribution companies to decarbonize its operations at the scale through a clean pole agreement and strengthening the, I would say, the company as a position in lowering its carbon footprint. So it's part of the capitalization, Nick."

One of the measures, kind of, like the strategy is to like get the value of electrons across the entire value chain, right. And how, like, reading your [indiscernible], then the distribution of those, so then to the retail clients for the EVs. You presumably would be buying the electrons and then passing it on to the clients for a margin. How is that going to work then? Have you -- is it something you can give color at this point or is it too early to ask?"

I find this, if I understood correctly, I mean, our core business is our core business. And within the core business, which includes mobility, EV is the space that we want to mature our strategy and definitely take a noticeable and concrete steps into providing that mobility solution and offering to our customers. So that's what we're sure about and focused about. We've also -- as my colleague, Athmane just mentioned, we are part of a broader global agreement between our Anchor shareholder and EWEC providing cleaner source of energy to satisfy our electricity needs at the station, and we are part of that umbrella agreement, which definitely sees green electrons from nuclear sources and renewable sources, namely solar coming to our stations, which again a serious step forward in the decarbonization agenda that we have.
Now to the -- if your question is about the supply chain, and there's something else that you intend to play in that role. At the moment, there's no visibility that I can't share with you. And I'm hesitant to respond to something that I've not fully understood. So -- but at least, I hope my answer is -- gives you that clarity. EV decarbonization through the global agreement is there. Value chain optimization and decarbonization is a step forward, but we are not there yet.
Nick -- sorry, Nick, just -- the last thing I want to just add is regarding the fact that we have advanced capabilities to offer actually low-emission natural gas for vehicles, so in JV. So the company today operates 31 service stations with CNG fueling capacity, and we continue to increase our offering across our network. It's just something I wanted to highlight."

So I would say that the regulatory framework is very strong and attractive for players like us, given the fact that we are providing the level of service that the government is expecting from us, and we don't see any reason to not have this kind of, level of margins going forward.
And I'll just repeat what we said already in Q1 and Q2, we still believe that given the fact that since August 2015, when the new regulatory framework has been unveiled, we did not have any inflation adjustment on our margins, and we have told the market that, obviously, we are and will continue to chase for higher margins going forward."
