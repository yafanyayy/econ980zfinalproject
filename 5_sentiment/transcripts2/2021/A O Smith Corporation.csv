Thank you, Pat. Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I want to send my deepest gratitude to the thousands of AO Smith employees who have been working under less than ideal conditions, and who continue to keep our operations running, offices open and customers in hot and treated water. To recap 2020, better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continued consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our AO Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments. 
We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe-at-home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventories stocking related to extended lead times resulted in above trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays in postponements in North America as well as pandemic related weakness in restaurant hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes declined by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize, high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year. 
In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remained operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remaining place in our facilities and our offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand, coupled with self-quarantine related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers, swing ships and expedited logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers.

We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedite logistics, in some cases, take care of our customers. All of these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs. 
To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I'm very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities, and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHD emissions by 10% by 2025. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the full year and the fourth quarter, beginning on Slide 5."

Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 p",1074,"Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased to 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of water right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and our water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of the oral segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns in weak end market demand, primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-price products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019. 
On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of water right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mixed skew to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pretax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% was slightly higher than in 2019. 
The rest of the world adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins than higher priced products, more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of 0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income. 
Turning to Slide 8. Record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America, and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019. 
Please advance to Slide 9. Record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of the world, fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency, China sales improved 15%, driven by mid single-digit growth in end market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. 
On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of World segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A costs and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019, primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter. 
Advancing to Slide 11, and cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019, lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong, our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020, and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares. 
Turning to Slide 12. We introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020, primarily due to higher earnings offset by higher investments in working capital than in prior year. 
In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million, slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% to 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of $160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin?"

Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. We are encouraged by the positive tone in the new construction market, although we believe some destocking will occur during 2021 as we expect industry lead times to improve throughout the year. The timing of the destocking is difficult to predict as we have 2 price increases announced, 1 affected in February and the second 1 in April. Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases. 
Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1, also between 5% and 9%, depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic impacted business, delayed, order for new construction and discretionary replacement installations. 
In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities, implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A, which will carry over into 2021. We've lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs to result in a stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid-single digits in 2021. 
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%. We assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacement demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint. 
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen censure, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial night FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the megatrends of health and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our use and our entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million. 
Advance to Slide 14. We project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment and China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%. 
To Slide 15, please. 2020 was a challenging year, we are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe AO Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.

Noise is always an issue because it's inside the home. And our water treatment products have been doing quite well. And we have a number of new ones coming up that will continue to expand our higher flow rates and along with having providing hot water. So great work on the mid price, but we haven't lost sight on our premium products. That's all 3 that I just mentioned are in the premium category."

So if it's 4% and a portion of that comes out of 2021, we're maybe down to that 2% headwind that we see. Helped a little bit by what we think will be encouragement in the housing offset of that. And we still see proactive demand on water heaters being pretty strong. So we kind of arrive at that 2%. When you think about kind of the cadence for the year, we don't believe the price increases that have been announced pulled much, if any, into sales into 2020 but the first quarter, effective February 1 and effective April 1, we would expect some increased demand on the price increase driving some volume into Q1."

And the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to '19, that would have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories. And in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those 2 categories and you get to the 9,000 to 9,500 stores. On the Tier 1 to Tier 2, our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we've talked about closing 1,000 stores, and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to at the end of this year, about 6,400 stores. So we've accomplished kind of where we were set out to do the closing of 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit -- we're continuing to look at new value at efficiency, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. Tier 3 -- or I'm sorry, Tier 4 or Tier 6, as Kevin said, it's a different selling model, and our expectations are different. And how we're really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that's what we'll probably be talking about more going forward. We've opened up more than that 500 stores that are target. And when I say opened up, we've got relationships and counters at significantly more than the 500 stores, and we're going to be just kind of looking at volumes through those stores going forward.

So yes, there's some headwind there, but there are so many moving parts. It's hard to say. I think we're going to -- we're just going to -- we're going to be chasing our cost a bit next year.

Now the margins, you're absolutely right. Our goal is to get the contribution margins back up to a similar percentage to the premium side of the product. That's going to take a little time.

We believe that GSE emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We're constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they're keeping in mind the technologies. And there isn't a one size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don't think a one size policy fit all is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. So that's going to navigate its way through, and we're going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are including, performance of the products included and cost to the consumers included. And from an AO Smith perspective, I think we're positioned well. We have a full line of residential electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat comp, residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market. And never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high-efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we're in a position. Again, I would tell you, we're part of the conversation, but we're also positioned well.

To recap 2020, better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continued consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our A.O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments.
We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe-at-home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventories stocking related to extended lead times resulted in above trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays in postponements in North America as well as pandemic-related weakness in restaurant hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes decline by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize, high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year.
In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remained operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remain in place in our facilities and our offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand coupled with self-quarantine-related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedited logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers.

Again, thank you, Pat. And our apologies for some technical difficulties here. This may be redundant, but we think it's important to start from the beginning.
Before we begin discussing our results and outlook, I want to send my deepest gratitude to the thousands of A.O. Smith employees who have been working under less than ideal conditions and have continued to keep our operations running, offices open and customers in hot and treated water. 
To recap 2020 better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continuing consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our A.O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year.

We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedite logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers. All of these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs.
To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I'm very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2025.
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the full year and the fourth quarter, beginning on Slide 5."

Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 p",1069,"Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019.
Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased to 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of water right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and our water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of World segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand, primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-price products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019.  
On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of water right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mixed skew to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pretax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% was slightly higher than in 2019.
Rest of World adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins than higher priced products, more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of 0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income.
Turning to Slide 8. Record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America, and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year, fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019.
Please advance to Slide 9. Record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of World fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency, China sales improved 15%, driven by mid single-digit growth in end market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of World segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A costs and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019, primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Advancing to Slide 11. Cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019. Lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong, our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020 and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares.  
Turning to Slide 12. We introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020, primarily due to higher earnings, offset by higher investments in working capital than in prior year.
In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million, slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% to 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021.
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin?"

Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. We are encouraged by the positive tone in the new construction market, although we believe some destocking will occur during 2021 as we expect industry lead times to improve throughout the year. The timing of the destocking is difficult to predict as we have 2 price increases announced, one effective in February and the second one in April. Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases.
Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1, also between 5% and 9%, depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic-impacted business delay order for new construction and discretionary replacement installations.
In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities; implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A, which will carry over into 2021. We've lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs to result in a stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid-single digits in 2021.
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%. We assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacement demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the megatrends of health and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and our point-of-entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points, higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million.  
Advance to Slide 14. We project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment and China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%.
To Slide 15, please. 2020 was a challenging year. We are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

When we look at inventories, we think about the fact that it's probably half of that might be inventories that have built up. So if you're in that -- 3% to 4% of that increase is inventories in the channel. Not all of that's going to come out of 2021, we don't think. So if it's 4% and a portion of that comes out of 2021, we're maybe down to that 2% headwind that we see, helped a little bit by what we think will be encouragement in the housing offset of that. And we still see proactive demand on water heaters being pretty strong. So we kind of arrived at that 2%. When you think about kind of the cadence for the year, we don't believe the price increases that have been announced pulled much, if any, into sales into 2020. But the first quarter, effective February 1 and effective April 1, we would expect some increased demand on the price increase driving some volume into Q1."

And the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to '19, that would have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories. And in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those 2 categories and you get to the 9,000 to 9,500 stores. 
On the Tier 1 to Tier 2, our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we've talked about closing 1,000 stores, and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to, at the end of this year, about 6,400 stores. So we've accomplished kind of where we were set out to do the closing of 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit -- we're continuing to look and evaluate efficiency, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. 
Tier 3 -- or I'm sorry, Tier 4 through 6, as Kevin said, it's a different selling model, and our expectations are different. And how we're really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that's what we'll probably be talking about more going forward. We've opened up more than that 500 stores that are target. And when I say opened up, we've got relationships and counters at significantly more than the 500 stores, and we're going to be just kind of looking at volumes through those stores going forward."

Comment there that you don't have double-digit margins built into the model for 2022. I know in conversations we've had that you targeted getting the mid-price tier product margins in China up to the premium tier margins by the end of 2021. With volume returning pretty nicely in ROW, why isn't it that you could get to double-digit margins in 2022?

So if you kind of look at the fourth quarter, you take out currency, you multiply it by 4, we're back to $1 billion business, and the year just doesn't play out that way. Q1 is always weaker. And so Q1 is just going to be challenged on that. So if you look at kind of the quarters building through the year, we're just not quite there yet on the volumes and on the cost out. 
Now the margins, you're absolutely right. Our goal is to get the contribution margins back up to a similar percentage to the premium side of the product. That's going to take a little time. It takes a couple of things. It takes cost out, which we're working on over time. We won't be in that position in 2021, but we are working on it, and it's going to take volume to help us kind of leverage that through the footprint in China."

And I'm not going to talk specifically about tankless. I would just talk about our position with regards to that. When you look at it, for us, it's important that we are part of the conversation. We believe that GHG emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We're constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they're keeping in mind the technologies. And there isn't a one-size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don't think a one-size policy fit all is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. 
So that's going to navigate its way through, and we're going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are included, performance of the product is included and cost to the consumer is included. And from an A.O. Smith perspective, I think we're positioned well. We have a full line of residential, electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat comp, residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market. 
And I never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high-efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we're in a position. Again, I would tell you, we're part of the conversation, but we're also positioned well.

To recap 2020, better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continued consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our A.O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments.
We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe-at-home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventories stocking related to extended lead times resulted in above trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays in postponements in North America as well as pandemic-related weakness in restaurant hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes decline by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize, high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year.
In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remained operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remain in place in our facilities and our offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand coupled with self-quarantine-related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedited logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers.

We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedite logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers. All of these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs.
To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I'm very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2025.
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the full year and the fourth quarter, beginning on Slide 5."

Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 p",1069,"Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. And as a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019.
Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased to 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of water right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and our water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of World segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand, primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-price products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019.  
On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of water right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mixed skew to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pretax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% was slightly higher than in 2019.
Rest of World adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins than higher priced products, more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of 0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income.
Turning to Slide 8. Record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America, and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year, fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019.
Please advance to Slide 9. Record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of World fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency, China sales improved 15%, driven by mid single-digit growth in end market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of World segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A costs and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019, primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Advancing to Slide 11. Cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019. Lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong, our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020 and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares.  
Turning to Slide 12. We introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020, primarily due to higher earnings, offset by higher investments in working capital than in prior year.
In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million, slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% to 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021.
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin?"
997111,700244052,2213848,"A. O. Smith Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","A. O. Smith Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics.

Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. We are encouraged by the positive tone in the new construction market, although we believe some destocking will occur during 2021 as we expect industry lead times to improve throughout the year. The timing of the destocking is difficult to predict as we have 2 price increases announced, one effective in February and the second one in April. Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases.
Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1, also between 5% and 9%, depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic-impacted business delay order for new construction and discretionary replacement installations.
In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities; implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A, which will carry over into 2021. We've lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs to result in a stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid-single digits in 2021.
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%. We assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacement demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the megatrends of health and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and our point-of-entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points, higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million.  
Advance to Slide 14. We project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment and China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%.
To Slide 15, please. 2020 was a challenging year. We are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

As always, Q1 is a challenge for us. So Q1 will be the lowest quarter. I would expect that we're going to progress progressively through the year like we have in the past. Maybe 2021 might be 45% of the revenue in the first half of the year, 55% in the back. And our best quarter will be Q4 again in 2021.

But the product category mix that we saw in Q4 was really helpful. So we had a higher product -- you get higher sales costs on gas tankless. Our water treatment product have higher sales price, decent commercial business in the quarter. 
So the mix between categories was very helpful to our growth. So that's probably the biggest pieces. I mean we're really pleased about the fact that our mix -- we've talked in the past about some headwind on mix, and we really kind of lapped that, as we said in our comments, where we really wouldn't expect a negative headwind on mix in China.

So I just want to calibrate you, as we open up those stores, they're really kind of counters with limited volume, but the ability to sell our product across those growing cities.

I mean so the Tier 4 to Tier 6 cities, and we're kind of parsing their stores a little different than what we have in the past. So we've talked historically about 9,000 or 9,500 stores. And we're parsing it really Tier 1 and Tier 2, and then back to what Kevin said, Tier 4 through Tier 6. And the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to '19, that would have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories. And in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those 2 categories and you get to the 9,000 to 9,500 stores. 
On the Tier 1 to Tier 2, our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we've talked about closing 1,000 stores, and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to, at the end of this year, about 6,400 stores. So we've accomplished kind of where we were set out to do the closing of 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit -- we're continuing to look and evaluate efficiency, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. 
Tier 3 -- or I'm sorry, Tier 4 through 6, as Kevin said, it's a different selling model, and our expectations are different. And how we're really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that's what we'll probably be talking about more going forward. We've opened up more than that 500 stores that are target. And when I say opened up, we've got relationships and counters at significantly more than the 500 stores, and we're going to be just kind of looking at volumes through those stores going forward."

So it's kind of what we expected in the tankless market and so forth. Now as far as we talk about California, you're talking about decarbonization and so forth. And I'm not going to talk specifically about tankless. I would just talk about our position with regards to that. When you look at it, for us, it's important that we are part of the conversation. We believe that GHG emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We're constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they're keeping in mind the technologies. And there isn't a one-size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don't think a one-size policy fit all is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. 
So that's going to navigate its way through, and we're going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are included, performance of the product is included and cost to the consumer is included. And from an A.O. Smith perspective, I think we're positioned well. We have a full line of residential, electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat comp, residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market. 
And I never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high-efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we're in a position. Again, I would tell you, we're part of the conversation, but we're also positioned well. So we can be nimble and where the market goes, we have the products that can meet the demand for the consumer and, of course, the commercial market as well."

To recap 2020, better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continued consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our A.O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments.
We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe-at-home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventories stocking related to extended lead times resulted in above-trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays and postponements in North America as well as pandemic-related weakness in restaurant hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes decline by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize, high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year.
In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remained operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remain in place in our facilities and our offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand coupled with self-quarantine-related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedited logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers.

We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedite logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers. All of these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs.
To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I'm very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first-ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2025.

Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. As a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per s",1067,"Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. As a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019.
Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of water right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and a water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of the World segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end-market demand, primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-price products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019.  
On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of water right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mixed skew to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pretax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% was slightly higher than in 2019.
Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins than higher-priced products, more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of 0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income.
Turning to Slide 8. Record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America, and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year, fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019.
Please advance to Slide 9. Record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of the World fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency, China sales improved 15%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in end-market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of the World segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A costs and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019, primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Advancing to Slide 11. Cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019. Lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong, our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020 and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares.  
Turning to Slide 12. We introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020, primarily due to higher earnings, offset by higher investments in working capital than in prior year.
In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million, slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% to 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021.
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin?"

Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics.

Our businesses and the countries in which we do business continue to navigate through pandemic-related challenges, particularly in supply chain and logistics. Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. We are encouraged by the positive tone in the new construction market, although we believe some destocking will occur during 2021 as we expect industry lead times to improve throughout the year. The timing of the destocking is difficult to predict as we have 2 price increases announced, one effective in February and the second one in April. Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases.
Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1, also between 5% and 9%, depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic-impacted business delay or defer for new construction and discretionary replacement installations.
In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities; implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A, which will carry over into 2021. We've lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs to result in a stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid-single digits in 2021.
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%. We assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacement demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the megatrends of health and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and our point-of-entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points, higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million.  
Advance to Slide 14. We project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment and China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%.
To Slide 15, please. 2020 was a challenging year. We are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

When you think about kind of the cadence for the year, we don't believe the price increases that have been announced pulled much, if any, into sales into 2020.

And the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to '19, that would have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories. And in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those 2 categories and you get to the 9,000 to 9,500 stores. 
On the Tier 1 to Tier 2, our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we've talked about closing 1,000 stores, and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to, at the end of this year, about 6,400 stores. So we've accomplished kind of where we were set out to do the closing of 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit -- we're continuing to look and evaluate efficiency, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. 
Tier 3 -- or I'm sorry, Tier 4 through 6, as Kevin said, it's a different selling model, and our expectations are different. And how we're really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that's what we'll probably be talking about more going forward. We've opened up more than that 500 stores that are target.

If you look at our strategy, our strategy is going to stay consistent. We're a premium brand. We use innovation to drive products into the consumers' market. We invest in high service levels. We're a high-quality company. That foundational part of our business is not going to change, in fact, it will continue to be enhanced. 
However, the market is changing. You have some online going -- getting larger. You have some changes in the retail sector in Tier 1, Tier 2. And what we're going to do is, we're going to remain nimble, like we have, adjusting our model as far as store openings and how we go to market. You'll see a big part of digital be a big driver for us as we engage customers going forward. The day of having somebody in every store as a promoter, we've talked about, are probably going to be limited. And we'll use digital more. And we'll continue to expand into the other markets. Those 4 and 6 Tier cities one day are going to be Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities. And we need to have a position there.
So overall, I mean, our strategy, where we're at, getting to those type of margins, we think are doable over time. And we've been taking the steps in 2020. We'll continue to take those steps in 2021 and beyond."

All that's going to matter as far for us to drive demand, both from just the economic side, but also from us looking at gaining some share.

I know you answered David's question earlier about labor and what have you.

So it's kind of what we expected in the tankless market and so forth. Now as far as when you talk about California, you're talking about decarbonization and so forth. And I'm not going to talk specifically about tankless. I would just talk about our position with regards to that. When you look at it, for us, it's important that we are part of the conversation. We believe that GHG emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We're constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they're keeping in mind the technologies. And there isn't a one-size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don't think a one-size policy fit all is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. 
So that's going to navigate its way through, and we're going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are included, performance of the product is included and cost to the consumer is included. And from an A.O. Smith perspective, I think we're positioned well. We have a full line of residential, electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat pump, residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market. 
And I never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high-efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we're in a position. Again, I would tell you, we're part of the conversation, but we're also positioned well. So we can be nimble and where the market goes, we have the products that can meet the demand for the consumer and, of course, the commercial market as well."

Smith employees who have been working under less than ideal conditions, and who continue to keep our operations running, offices open and customers in hot and treated water. 
To recap 2020, better-than-expected fourth quarter results drove our 2020 performance above our expectations. North America water treatment grew 14% organically, driven by continued consumer demand for products promoting a safe home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand, retail outlets with our A.O. Smith brand and the dealer channel all contributed to solid 2020 growth. We believe industry shipments of U.S. residential water heaters, including tankless, surged to a record, exceeding 10 million units or 8% growth over the prior year. This assessment is based on our strong December shipments.
We believe the overall positive tone to new residential and safe-at-home remodel construction activity, including an increase in proactive replacement demand and channel inventories stocking related to extended lead times resulted in above-trend growth in 2020. Due to construction project delays and postponements in North America as well as pandemic-related weakness in restaurant hospitality, new construction and replacement demand, we saw commercial water heater and boiler industry volumes decline by 8% to 10%. We maintained our market share in both of these categories. Progressive year-over-year improvement in consumer demand for our products in China continued in the fourth quarter. As a result of higher volumes and diligent efforts by our team to reduce costs and reorganize, high single-digit margins were achieved in the second half of the year.
In North America, aside from the voluntary closure of our Mexican facility for several weeks in the second quarter, we remained operational throughout 2020 with no significant disruptions within our plants and our supply chain. Pandemic-related safety protocols remain in place in our facilities and our offices. Due to strong residential water heater demand coupled with self-quarantine-related absenteeism, our lead times remain above normal. We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedited logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers.

We continue to use temporary workers, swing shifts and expedite logistics, in some cases, to take care of our customers. All of these efforts result in inefficiencies and incremental costs.
To align our business with current global market conditions, we reduced headcount and incurred other restructuring costs totaling approximately $6 million after-tax in 2020. The majority of these actions took place in China. We published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report in January. I'm very proud of our accomplishments since our first report, particularly in employee engagement, safety, resource reduction in our facilities and a product portfolio that boasts some of the most efficient products in their respective categories. We introduced our first-ever public greenhouse gas emission goal. We strive to reduce GHG emissions by 10% by 2025.

Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. As a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per s",1067,"Thank you, Kevin. Full year sales of $2.9 billion declined 3% compared with 2019, largely due to significant weakness in the China business in the first half of 2020. As a result of lower sales, adjusted earnings declined 3% to $351 million or $2.16 per share compared with $370 million or $2.22 per share in 2019.
Please turn to Slide 6. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased 2% compared with 2019. Higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment as well as full year of water right sales were partially offset by lower U.S. commercial water heater volumes, lower boiler sales and a water heater sales mix composed of more electric models, which have a lower selling price. Rest of the World segment sales of $800 million declined 14% from 2019. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end-market demand, primarily in China in the first half of the year and a higher mix of mid-price products resulted in lower sales. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $9 million. Indian sales were also negatively impacted by pandemic-related economic disruption and declined to $31 million compared with $39 million in 2019.  
On Slide 7, North America segment adjusted earnings of $506 million increased 4% compared to 2019. The increase in earnings was driven by favorable impact to earnings from higher residential water heater volumes, growth in water treatment sales, a full year of water right sales and lower material costs. The impact to earnings from lower volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and the mixed skew to electric water heaters partially offset these factors. Adjusted segment earnings exclude $2.7 million in pretax severance costs. As a result, adjusted operating margin of 23.9% was slightly higher than in 2019.
Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $5 million declined significantly compared with 2019. In China, the unfavorable impact from lower sales and the higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins than higher-priced products, more than offset reductions in SG&A costs and temporary waivers for required social insurance contributions. As a result of these factors, adjusted segment operating margin of 0.6% declined from 4.3% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $52 million were higher than in 2019, primarily driven by lower interest income.
Turning to Slide 8. Record fourth quarter sales of $835 million increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was largely due to higher residential water heater volumes in North America, and higher sales in China. As a result of higher sales and cost reduction initiatives earlier this year, fourth quarter earnings of $120 million or $0.74 per share increased significantly compared with 2019.
Please advance to Slide 9. Record fourth quarter sales in North America segment of $561 million increased 7% compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes. Rest of the World fourth quarter segment sales of $279 million improved 19% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Constant currency, China sales improved 15%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in end-market demand led by water treatment, replacement water treatment filters and gas tankless water heaters and a favorable mix between product categories compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.  
On Slide 10, record fourth quarter North America segment earnings of $138 million increased 7% from the same period in 2019. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes in North America and lower steel costs. These factors were partially offset by logistic costs. As a result, fourth quarter segment margin of 24.6% was slightly higher than 24.5% in 2019. Rest of the World segment earnings of $31 million improved significantly from $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2019. In China, higher volumes, reductions in SG&A costs and lower material costs drove higher earnings. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter segment margin improved to 11.2% compared with 0.6% in 2019. Our corporate expenses of $16 million in the fourth quarter were higher than in the same period of 2019, primarily due to an increase in long-term incentives and lower interest income in the 2020 fourth quarter.
Advancing to Slide 11. Cash provided by operations of $562 million during 2020 was higher than 2019. Lower investments in working capital in 2020 were partially offset by lower earnings compared with the prior year. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong, our cash balances totaled $690 million at the end of 2020 and our net cash position was $576 million. At the end of 2020, our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital. We are in the process of refinancing our $500 million revolving credit facility, which expires at the end of the year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. We expect to repurchase $400 million worth of shares in 2021 through a combination of 10b5-1 program and open market purchases. Recently, our Board increased the authorized shares on our share repurchase authority by 7 million shares.  
Turning to Slide 12. We introduced our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 13% compared with our 2020 results. Our guidance assumes the conditions of our business environment and that of our suppliers and customers are similar in 2021 to what we have experienced in recent months and does not deteriorate as a result of further restrictions or potential shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $450 million and $475 million compared with $560 million in 2020, primarily due to higher earnings, offset by higher investments in working capital than in prior year.
In 2021, capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $51 million, slightly lower than in 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be between 22.5% to 23% in 2021. Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021.
I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 13. Kevin?"

Destocking activity could be delayed until midyear due to the pre-buy orders in advance of the price increases.
Further note on the 2021 price increases. We have seen inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased nearly 50% since we announced our February 1 water heater price increase of 5% to 9%. We announced the second price increase last week on water heaters effective April 1, also between 5% and 9%, depending on the type of water heater. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will further decline approximately 4% as pandemic-impacted business delay or defer for new construction and discretionary replacement installations.
In China, it is encouraging to see consumer demand for our China products progressively improve in 2020 and into January of 2021. We accomplished much in China in 2020, which will allow us to profitably grow in 2021. Those accomplishments include closing 1,000 stores in Tier 1 and 2 cities, while efficiently expanding in Tier 4 through 6 cities; implementing programs to save $30 million in SG&A, which will carry over into 2021. We've lapped the negative impact to earnings from mid-priced products. We expect positive mix in 2021 of new products. And we executed programs to result in a stronger and more nimble distributors. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 14% and 15%. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $45 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We expect our North America boiler sales will increase by mid-single digits in 2021.
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. First, industry growth of 3% to 4%. We assume some pent-up demand after the industry decline in the low teens levels in 2020. The CAGR for commercial condensing boilers, which is over 50% of the boiler revenue, was 5% to 6% prior to 2020. We believe replacement demand is still 85%. A potential government stimulus package targeting infrastructure investment may free up some jobs that were postponed or halted in 2020. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry that represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen sensor, which continually measures and optimizes boiler performance and the introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL boiler. We project 13% to 14% sales growth in our North America water treatment products. We believe the megatrends of health and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and our point-of-entry water treatment systems. We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points, higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. And in India, fourth quarter sales were similar to the prior year. We project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 and to incur a small loss of $1 million to $2 million.  
Advance to Slide 14. We project revenue will increase by approximately 10% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment and China sales enhanced by growth in boiler sales more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our 10% growth rate projection includes approximately $45 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margins to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%.
To Slide 15, please. 2020 was a challenging year. We are pleased with our performance through the pandemic. Particularly in these uncertain times, we believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents approximately 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong premium brand in China, a broad product offering in key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. We are very excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long-term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

But the product category mix that we saw in Q4 was really helpful. So we had a higher product -- you get higher sales costs on gas tankless.

When you think about kind of the cadence for the year, we don't believe the price increases that have been announced pulled much, if any, into sales into 2020.

And the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, if you go back to '19, that would have been a little over 7,000 stores in those categories. And in the Tier 4 to 6 is around 2,000. So you kind of split it up into those 2 categories and you get to the 9,000 to 9,500 stores. 
On the Tier 1 to Tier 2, our focus is really efficiency, looking at store efficiencies, and we've talked about closing 1,000 stores, and we have. So we went from about 7,400 stores at the end of 2019 to, at the end of this year, about 6,400 stores. So we've accomplished kind of where we were set out to do the closing of 1,000 stores. When we look into next year, not much change. We probably have a little bit -- we're continuing to look and evaluate efficiency, but we did not expect much change in the Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities. 
Tier 3 -- or I'm sorry, Tier 4 through 6, as Kevin said, it's a different selling model, and our expectations are different. And how we're really measuring that is less about how many counters or footprints we have and more about the volume of sales going through there. So that's what we'll probably be talking about more going forward. We've opened up more than that 500 stores that are target. And when I say opened up, we've got relationships and counters at significantly more than the 500 stores, and we're going to be just kind of looking at volumes through those stores going forward."

And of course, new construction, depending on labor in the market. There's a lot of things that can happen that can drive demand. One of the biggest challenge for the construction business has been labor. 
So those are 2 things that as things progress, and again, I keep going back to as the economy opens up and as -- we haven't had salespeople traveling for a year other than under emergency conditions where we're not spending time in the market as much as we like to. All that's going to matter as far for us to drive demand, both from just the economic side, but also from us looking at gaining some share. So it's -- there's more action that have to happen, but they also have to be some economic and some opening up of the economy for us to move that forward and bring the inventories down."

So it's kind of what we expected in the tankless market and so forth. Now as far as when you talk about California, you're talking about decarbonization and so forth. And I'm not going to talk specifically about tankless. I would just talk about our position with regards to that. When you look at it, for us, it's important that we are part of the conversation. We believe that GHG emissions in residential and commercial buildings, we want to be part of reducing those. We're constantly talking to policymakers just to make sure that they're keeping in mind the technologies. And there isn't a one-size fit all. You hear like California that they want to just go completely electric. We don't think a one-size policy fit all is the right way to go. We think multiple paths are there. 
So that's going to navigate its way through, and we're going to be part of the conversation to make sure that technologies are included, performance of the product is included and cost to the consumer is included. And from an A.O. Smith perspective, I think we're positioned well. We have a full line of residential, electric and commercial products in the market today. We have a full line of heat pump, residential and commercial, which are the highest efficient electric water heaters out on the market. 
And I never want to forget that we have leading positions in condensing products, gas condensing, which can make a big difference in lowering GHG emissions just by going from a standard to a high-efficiency model. So wherever the market is going to go, we're in a position. Again, I would tell you, we're part of the conversation, but we're also positioned well. So we can be nimble and where the market goes, we have the products that can meet the demand for the consumer and, of course, the commercial market as well."

Our global A.O. Smith team delivered first quarter EPS of $0.60 on a 21% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution despite pandemic and weather-related challenges in our supply chain and operations, along with rapidly rising material costs. 
I greatly appreciate the diligence of our team to keep each other healthy and safe. Outside of India, where COVID-19 cases have recently surged, I am pleased that we have experienced steady improvement in this area since the beginning of the year. 
North America water treatment grew 12%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products, which provides safe drinking water in the home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand and the dealer channel contributed to solid growth to start '21. 
Boiler sales grew 12% as we have seen strong demand, particularly within commercial boilers as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020 as well as a resilient replacement demand. Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters declined in the first quarter due to weather disruptions at our facility, supply chain constraints, which limited production. If not for limited production, based on our surge in customer orders in the quarter, our U.S. residential shipments would have increased compared with 2020. 
Strong orders in the quarter were largely due to extended lead times, our second price increase, which was effective April 1 and announced third price increase effective in June. Due to continued pandemic-related disruptions in restaurant and hospitality new construction and replacement demand, our commercial water hear volumes declined in the first quarter, largely in line with our expectations coming into the year. 
In China, sales increased over 100% in local currency, driven by higher consumer demand and the easy comparison compared with the pandemic disrupted first quarter of 2020. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter, beginning on Slide 4."

First quarter sales of $769 million increased 21% compared with 2020, largely due to significantly higher China sales. As a result of higher sales, first quarter net earnings increased 89% to $98 million or $0.60 per share compared with $52 million or $0.32 per share in 2020. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $553 million increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2020. Higher commercial boiler, service parts, and tankless water heater sales in the U.S., improved water heater sales in Canada, a 12% price growth -- 12% growth in water treatment sales and inflation related price increases on water heaters in the U.S. were partially offset by lower U.S. residential and commercial water heater volumes. 
Rest of the World segment sales of $222 million increased over 100% from the first quarter of 2020, driven by stronger consumer demand in each of our major product categories in China. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand in the first quarter of 2020 provided an easy comparison for the first quarter of 2021. 
Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of $130 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher sales and inflation-related price increases on water heaters was partially offset by higher material costs and freight costs and lower water heater volumes in the U.S. 
Segment operating margin of 23.6% was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2020. Rest of the World segment earnings of $12 million, increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs contributed to higher segment earnings. As a result, segment operating margin of 5.3% improved significantly from negative 38.3% in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our corporate expenses of $15 million were similar to the first quarter of 2020. Our effective tax rate of 22.5% and was 110 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to geographical differences in pretax income. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $104 million increase -- or during the first quarter was higher than the first quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of higher earnings in 2020 compared with the prior year. 
Our cash balances totaled $660 million at the end of the first quarter, and our net cash position was $559 million. Our leverage ratio was 5% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of the first quarter. 
We completed refinancing our $500 million revolver credit facility on April 1 of this year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $67 million. 
Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.55 and $2.65 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 20% compared with the 2020 adjusted results. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $475 million and $500 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in our prior year. 
Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $52 million, which is similar to 2020. 
Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. The average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9. Kevin?"

The first quarter was particularly challenging for our North America water heater business. Severe weather impacted our Ashland City and Wares facilities and resulted in a week out of production at each plant in the quarter. 
Supply chain constraints limited our ability to make up the lost production within the quarter. As a result of a surge in orders approximately 30% higher than the first quarter last year, our lead times have further extended. We are working with customers on managing orders, along with our operations and supply chain teams working diligently to meet demand. However, we expect to be catching up throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter. 
Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have not changed our outlook for full year U.S. residential heater industry volumes and continue to project a full year volume will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. A small retracement from the record volume shipped in 2020. 
We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will decline approximately 4% as pandemic impacted business delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installation. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics costs. Steel has increased 25% since we announced our April 1 water heater price increase. 
We announced a third price increase in late March on water heaters effective June 1 at a blended rate of 8.5%. In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong through April. Our strategy continues to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher-priced products across all product categories, driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. 
We expect year-over-year increase and local currency sales between 18% to 20% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $50 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We have nearly doubled our growth projections and our outlook for our North America boiler sales for mid- single-digit growth to approximately 10% growth based on a strong first quarter, strong backlog and visibility into cording activity. 
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. We believe pent-up demand from the declines last year will drive growth. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint. 
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry. That represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. New product launches, including improvements to our flagship Crest commercial condensing boiler with a market differentiating oxygen center, which continuously measures and optimizes boiler performance, an introduction of a 1 million BTU light-duty commercial night FXL. 
We continue to project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in our North America water treatment products, similar to that, which we have seen in the first quarter. We believe the mega trends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and port of entry water treatment systems. 
We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. In India, first quarter 2021 sales were nearly double the prior year. While India is challenged with recent COVID case resurgence, we project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 to incur a smaller loss of 1 to 2 point million. 
Please turn to Slide 10. We project revenue will increase between 14% to 15% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment, boiler and China sales enhanced by pricing action more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our sales growth projections include approximately $50 million of benefit from China currency translation. 
We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5%, and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%. I'm on Slide 11. Our operations faced continued challenges in the first quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics in the near term, I have confidence in our teams to continue to navigate through this environment. Along with the strength of our people, I believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes. 
We have a strong brand, premium brand in China, a broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. 
We are excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

We've got 2 plants that were down Ashland City and whereas were down due to weather for approximately a week each, so that it does a couple of things. One is it raises kind of the orders that come in from a perspective of it, it creates a bit of a surge. And when lead times extend a bit due to a temporary interruption, we see more orders, which extend the lead times. So that quantification, we do expect to make that up in the second and third quarters. 
We would expect that we would get a little bit more normalization of production throughout the second and third quarter, and those orders would come in. Now to quantify the surge in orders, it's a bit difficult. There's a lot of noise in the marketplace from the interruption I just described as well as 3 price increases at once. So not all at once, but February, April and June, and that just creates -- that just creates a bit of noise. 
So as far as the effectuation of kind of the pricing on those, we work to manage kind of the orders that come through on a more normalized basis. But the extended lead times do push that realization on price out slightly. So an April 1 price increase, for example, is going to be extended a bit. But when we look at all of our pricing, we would expect that the full impact would be implemented when we get into the third quarter."

There's certainly going to be some new construction activity, but just remember that we really come into play in completions, not starts. 
So right now, we just think that the 200,000 we trace that we talked about is probably the best forecast we can have until we work through this backlog and get to the other side to really understand what was true demand versus just normal demand brought forward by pricing or extended lead time. So it's -- again, you'll probably hear us say this a little bit. Just a little too early to take these numbers, considering there's so many variables that we're going to have to work through.

But when you think about our biggest category, which is steel, and we've talked a lot about steel pricing going up. It's coming in. We do have a benefit of a 90- to 120-day lag. So when we think about steel costs hitting us, progressively gets higher during the year. 
So year-over-year steel costs just -- we expect it to be on average, up over 70%. But when you look at the quarter cadence, kind of back to your question, we get hit with the highest costs in the third and fourth quarter. So the most pressure on margins in North America will be in the back half of the year as we feel the full impact of some of the higher price increases that we're seeing on cost side and see some of the pricing being more fully implemented in the fourth quarter."

When we look back on the margins that you would generate in the Rest of the World business for a long, long time before things became problematic in China, it was kind of a 13% margin. And I'm just wondering, if we step back here for a second and talk longer term, how you're thinking about the potential for margin generation in China? What -- did we go back to 13% numbers? Is I know there's been a transition to a higher concentration of medium price point versus premium price point. But I think you'd indicated on prior calls that you felt like the margins were relatively equivalent. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the potential on RoW margins? Or is there upside based on various initiatives you've undertaken along the way, help us think longer-term about the potential there?"

I mean so we framed our Rest of the World margins this year in that 7% to 8%. And what we saw last year in the fourth quarter as we were at the double-digit margin percentage, and we get a little bit of volume. And so right now, 10% is kind of where",303,"Yes. I mean so we framed our Rest of the World margins this year in that 7% to 8%. And what we saw last year in the fourth quarter as we were at the double-digit margin percentage, and we get a little bit of volume. And so right now, 10% is kind of where our target is in the upcoming time frame, not this year. 
But as we look at that, that's certainly doable in the current environment where we've got a heavier amount of mid-priced products than we historically have. We haven't seen the strength in the trading up on the high end of the market. Even though Kevin had noted in his remarks that we've seen some positive trends in that area. It's not at the same level as what we had in the past. And those margins, while we on a percentage basis are similar, they are lower than the high end of the market. So we do get some pressure on that. 
So when we think about kind of the transition that the business has taken a bit on store count efficiency, the SG&A initiatives that we've done. We have taken costs out of the business to grow a bit back into higher margins. We need a little bit more volume. We'd also like to see some trading up outside of the categories and the water treatment has been a pretty good category for us, but we'd like to see more trading up housing coming back would help us to get some of the volume back up and just consumer confidence in the trading up. 
So we need a little bit of help in that category to get back to higher margins than what we're experiencing today, but those are some of the areas that we're watching very closely."

And at times, tankless is the best and other times the tank is. When you look at the business today, we talked a bit about Texas. So our tankless has been up a bit, and it's interesting because in Texas, it's a warmer climate and a lot of the tankless were installed outdoors. And that's fine, we -- because there's an electrical part of thing for a freeze that prevent the unit from freezing. But we saw an uptick in Texas because not only did we have cold weather, but we had no electricity as well. And so tankless for us was up in the quarter. And it was just driven by a onetime weather-related item that can happen. But overall, I mean, I don't want to leave tankless is still part of our long-term strategy. It's part of our residential product offering. And just like any other products that we have, heat pumps and regular electrics and so forth. And so we're committed to it.

Our global A.O. Smith team delivered first quarter EPS of $0.60 on a 21% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution despite pandemic and weather-related challenges in our supply chain and operations, along with rapidly rising material costs.
I greatly appreciate the diligence of our team to keep each other healthy and safe. Outside of India, where COVID-19 cases have recently surged, I am pleased that we have experienced steady improvement in this area since the beginning of the year.
North America water treatment grew 12%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products, which provides safe drinking water in the home. The direct-to-consumer channel with our Aquasana brand and the dealer channel contributed to solid growth to start 2021.
Boiler sales grew 12% as we have seen strong demand, particularly within commercial boilers as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020 as well as a resilient replacement demand. Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters declined in the first quarter due to weather disruptions at our facility, supply chain constraints, which limited production. If not for limited production, based on our surge in customer orders in the quarter, our U.S. residential shipments would have increased compared with 2020.
Strong orders in the quarter were largely due to extended lead times, our second price increase, which was effective April 1 and announced third price increase effective in June. Due to continued pandemic-related disruptions in restaurant and hospitality new construction and replacement demand, our commercial water hear volumes declined in the first quarter, largely in line with our expectations coming into the year.
In China, sales increased over 100% in local currency, driven by higher consumer demand and the easy comparison compared with the pandemic-disrupted first quarter of 2020.
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter, beginning on Slide 4."

First quarter sales of $769 million increased 21% compared with 2020, largely due to significantly higher China sales. As a result of higher sales, first quarter net earnings increased 89% to $98 million or $0.60 per share compared with $52 million or $0.32 per share in 2020.
Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $553 million increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2020. Higher commercial boiler, service parts, and tankless water heater sales in the U.S., improved water heater sales in Canada, a 12% price growth -- 12% growth in water treatment sales and inflation-related price increases on water heaters in the U.S. were partially offset by lower U.S. residential and commercial water heater volumes.
Rest of the world segment sales of $222 million increased over 100% from the first quarter of 2020, driven by stronger consumer demand in each of our major product categories in China. Pandemic-related lockdowns and weak end market demand in the first quarter of 2020 provided an easy comparison for the first quarter of 2021. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. 
On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of $130 million increased 3% compared with the first quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher sales and inflation-related price increases on water heaters was partially offset by higher material costs and freight costs and lower water heater volumes in the U.S.
Segment operating margin of 23.6% was slightly lower than the first quarter of 2020. Rest of the World segment earnings of $12 million, increased significantly compared with the first quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs contributed to higher segment earnings. As a result, segment operating margin of 5.3% improved significantly from negative 38.3% in the first quarter of 2020.
Our corporate expenses of $15 million were similar to the first quarter of 2020. Our effective tax rate of 22.5% and was 110 basis points lower than the prior year, largely due to geographical differences in pretax income.
Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $104 million increase -- or during the first quarter was higher than the first quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of higher earnings in 2020 compared with the prior year.
Our cash balances totaled $660 million at the end of the first quarter, and our net cash position was $559 million. Our leverage ratio was 5% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of the first quarter.
We completed refinancing our $500 million revolver credit facility on April 1 of this year. We currently have no borrowings on this facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $67 million.
Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.55 and $2.65 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 20% compared with the 2020 adjusted results. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $475 million and $500 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in our prior year.
Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $52 million, which is similar to 2020.
Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. The average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumes $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021.
I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9. Kevin?"

The first quarter was particularly challenging for our North America water heater business. Severe weather impacted our Ashland City and Juarez facilities and resulted in a week out of production at each plant in the quarter.
Supply chain constraints limited our ability to make up the lost production within the quarter. As a result of a surge in orders approximately 30% higher than the first quarter last year, our lead times have further extended. We are working with customers on managing orders, along with our operations and supply chain teams working diligently to meet demand. However, we expect to be catching up throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter.
Our outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have not changed our outlook for full year U.S. residential heater industry volumes and continue to project a full year volume will be down 2% or 200,000 units in 2021. A small retracement from the record volume shipped in 2020.
We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will decline approximately 4% as pandemic impacted business delay or defer new construction and discretionary replacement installation. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics costs. Steel has increased 25% since we announced our April 1 water heater price increase.
We announced a third price increase in late March on water heaters effective June 1 at a blended rate of 8.5%. In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong through April. Our strategy continues to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher-priced products across all product categories, driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months.
We expect year-over-year increase in local currency sales between 18% to 20% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $50 million and $3 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. We have nearly doubled our growth projections in our outlook for our North America boiler sales for mid- single-digit growth to approximately 10% growth based on a strong first quarter, strong backlog and visibility into coding activity.
Our expectations are based on several growth drivers. We believe pent-up demand from the declines last year will drive growth. The transition to higher energy-efficient boilers will continue, particularly as commercial buildings improve their overall carbon footprint.
In 2020, condensing boilers were 39% of the commercial boiler industry. That represents our addressable market, which provides continued opportunity for our leading market share commercial condensing boilers. 
New product launches, including improvements to our flagship CREST commercial condensing boiler with a market-differentiating oxygen sensor, which continuously measures and optimizes boiler performance, and introduction of 1 million BTU light-duty commercial Knight FTXL.
We continue to project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in our North America water treatment products, similar to that, which we have seen in the first quarter. We view the mega trends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as a reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems.
We believe margins in this business could grow by 100 to 200 basis points higher than the nearly 10% margin achieved in 2020. In India, first quarter 2021 sales were nearly double the prior year. While India is challenged with recent COVID case resurgence, we project 2021 full year sales to increase over 20% compared with 2020 to incur a smaller loss of 1 to 2 point million dollars.
Please turn to Slide 10. We project revenue will increase between 14% to 15% in 2021 as strong North America water treatment, boiler and China sales enhanced by pricing action more than offset expected weaker North America water heater volumes. Our sales growth projections include approximately $50 million of benefit from China currency translation. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5%, and Rest of World segment margins to be between 7% and 8%. 
I'm on Slide 11. Our operations faced continued challenges in the first quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics in the near term, I have confidence in our teams to continue to navigate through this environment. Along with the strength of our people, I believe A.O. Smith is a compelling investment for numerous reasons. We have leading share positions in our major product categories. We estimate replacement demand represents 80% to 85% of U.S. water heater and boiler volumes.
We have a strong brand, premium brand in China, a broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation in that region. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value.
We are excited for the opportunity we see in our North America water treatment platform. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, supporting the ability to continue to invest for the long term with investments in automation, innovation and new products as well as acquisitions and return cash to shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

We've got 2 plants that were down Ashland City and Juarez were down due to weather for approximately a week each, so that it does a couple of things. One, it raises kind of the orders that come in from a perspective of it, it creates a bit of a surge. And when lead times extend a bit due to a temporary interruption, we see more orders, which extend the lead times. 
So that quantification, we do expect to make that up in the second and third quarters. We would expect that we would get a little bit more normalization of production throughout the second and third quarter, and those orders would come in. 
Now to quantify the surge in orders, it's a bit difficult. There's a lot of noise in the marketplace from the interruption I just described as well as 3 price increases at once. So not all at once, but February, April and June, and that just creates -- that just creates a bit of noise.
So as far as the effectuation of kind of the pricing on those, we work to manage kind of the orders that come through on a more normalized basis. But the extended lead times do push that realization on price out slightly. So an April 1 price increase, for example, is going to be extended a bit. But when we look at all of our pricing, we would expect that the full impact would be implemented when we get into the third quarter."

So right now, we just think that the 200,000 retracement we talked about is probably the best forecast we can have until we work through this backlog and get to the other side to really understand what was true demand versus just normal demand brought forward by pricing or extended lead time. 
So it's -- again, you'll probably hear us say this a little bit. Just a little too early to take these numbers, considering there's so many variables that we're going to have to work through. But we'll have a better, clearer picture probably end of second quarter, early third quarter."

But when you think about our biggest category, which is steel, and we've talked a lot about steel pricing going up. It's coming in. We do have a benefit of a 90- to 120-day lag. So when we think about steel costs hitting us, progressively gets higher during the year.
So year-over-year steel costs just -- we expect it to be on average, up over 70%. But when you look at the quarter cadence, kind of back to your question, we get hit with the highest costs in the third and fourth quarter. So the most pressure on margins in North America will be in the back half of the year as we feel the full impact of some of the higher price increases that we're seeing on cost side and see some of the pricing being more fully implemented in the fourth quarter."

And we really saw that we always really had in the water treatment throughout the pandemic, but we really saw some nice movement up on our residential electric and gas tankless. I think there's some new products, particularly on the gas tankless, which is a Grade 1 product that has the lowest noise level, which is exceptionally important to the Chinese consumer.
So overall, the business is moving in the right direction. We think we're positioned very well over the next few quarters to move that business forward. From the inventory position, I'll let Chuck review that."

And that -- the cadence of that by quarter we got the most benefit last year in Q2 and Q3. 
So Q1 was very small last year. So that's a bit of a headwind as we go through the rest of the year in China. So I mean we're pleased with where the first quarter came out in China, just under 6%. That was a pretty solid quarter for what is always a challenging seasonal quarter for us with the festivals and the holiday. And the fourth quarter is always our strongest.
So as we kind of look at China, and Kevin mentioned it, we would expect the back 3 quarters of the year to progressively improve. Overall growth rate in that 6% to 7%. And then when we get into the fourth quarter, approaching double-digit operating margins in the fourth quarter, similar to what we had last year."

And I'm just wondering, if we step back here for a second and talk longer term, how you're thinking about the potential for margin generation in China? What -- did we go back to 13% numbers? 
I know there's been a transition to a higher concentration of medium price point versus premium price point. But I think you'd indicated on prior calls that you felt like the margins were relatively equivalent. And so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the potential on RoW margins?

And so right now, 10% is kind of where our target is in the upcoming time frame, not this year.
But as we look at that, that's certainly doable in the current environment where we've got a heavier amount of mid-priced products than we historically have. We haven't seen the strength in the trading up on the high end of the market. Even though Kevin had noted in his remarks that we've seen some positive trends in that area. It's not at the same level as what we had in the past. And those margins, while we -- on a percentage basis are similar, they are lower than the high end of the market. So we do get some pressure on that.
So when we think about kind of the transition that the business has taken a bit on store count efficiency, the SG&A initiatives that we've done. We have taken costs out of the business to grow a bit back into higher margins. We need a little bit more volume. We'd also like to see some trading up outside of the categories, water treatment has been a pretty good category for us, but we'd like to see more trading up. Housing coming back would help us to get some of the volume back up and just consumer confidence in the trading up.
So we need a little bit of help in that category to get back to higher margins than what we're experiencing today, but those are some of the areas that we're watching very closely."

When you look at the business today, we talked a bit about Texas. So our tankless has been up a bit, and it's interesting because in Texas, it's a warmer climate and a lot of the tankless were installed outdoors. And that's fine because there's an electrical part, if things were to freeze, that prevent the unit from freezing. But we saw an uptick in Texas because not only did we have cold weather, but we had no electricity as well. And so tankless for us was up in the quarter. And it was just driven by a onetime weather-related item that can happen. 
But overall, I mean, I don't want to leave, tankless is still part of our long-term strategy. It's part of our residential product offering.

Our global A.O. Smith team delivered second quarter EPS of $0.73 on a 30% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution and operational agility despite supply chain and logistic challenges, along with rapidly rising material costs. I am thankful for my fellow A.O. Smith employees who tirelessly navigated through the pandemic, followed by weather-related production disruptions and continued to navigate supply chain constraints. I appreciate the creativity and the collaboration of our team to find solutions to keep our customers supply with water heating and water treatment products. 
Boiler sales grew 35%, driven by strong demand as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020 as well as an active education end market. For reference, our boiler sales were down 15% in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. North America water treatment grew 17%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products which provide safe drinking water in the home. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well in the quarter and online promotional shopping days also boosted sales. 
Consistent with our strategy to build out distribution for North America water treatment, we acquired Master Water Conditioning Corporation. The acquisition supplements our presence in the Northeast, and we are excited to add expertise in local water condition and solutions in this region to our family. Our North America water treatment sales, including this acquisition are expected to be over $200 million in 2021. Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters increased in the second quarter. We believe the strong demand is a continued result of extended lead times caused by production constraints due to strain in the supply chain, finding in advance of price increases and incremental new home construction. 
After our weather-related disruptions in production, which we talked about on our first quarter call, we have seen month-over-month sequential improvement and certain of our suppliers recently noted they see moderation of demand and supply imbalances. But we remain viligent as the imbalances are spotty, and we expect supply chain challenges to be with us through the remainder of the year. 
In response to continued material and logistic cost increases, we recently announced a fourth price increase of between 10% and 12% effective August 1. In China, sales increased over 26% in local currency, driven by growth in each of our major product categories, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, including commercial and replacement filters. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the second quarter beginning on Slide 4."

Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42",610,"Thank you, Kevin. Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42 per share in 2020. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $604 million increased 26% compared with the second quarter of 2020, driven by higher volumes of water heaters, boilers and water treatment products and inflation-related price increases. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 39% from the second quarter of 2020. Growth in each of our major product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 26% in the quarter. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $20 million. 
India sales more than doubled in the second quarter despite the recent surge in cases of the virus in that region. North America segment earnings of $142 million increased 34% compared with the second quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher volumes and inflation-related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating margin of 23.5% improved compared with the second quarter of 2020 segment margin of 21.9%. Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million increased significantly compared with the loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by shutdowns and reduced consumer spending resulting from the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs were partially offset by the absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. As a result, segment operating margin of 8.5% improved from a negative 3% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher than last year largely due to management incentives. Our effective tax rate of 21.9% was essentially the same as last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $196 million during the first half was higher than during the first half of 2020. Higher earnings in 2021 compared with the prior year were partially offset by a larger investment in working capital during the first half of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020.  Our cash balances totaled $582 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $476 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.5%, as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of June. Through June 30, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of common stock for a total of $198 million. 
Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.70 and $2.76 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 5% compared with our prior quarter full year guidance. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $500 million and $525 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in the prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. 
Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. 
Average outstanding diluted shares of $160 million assumed $4 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9. Kevin?"

That being said, we raised our 2021 top line growth expectation and now project an increase of between 17% and 18%, driven by strong demand and price increases implemented in response to rising material and transportation costs. Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions:  with 7 months of visibility, we've upgraded our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to increase approximately 3% compared with last year; we expect continued resilient replacement demand and growth in new home construction; with our fourth price increase in the market and continued consumer demand, we no longer believe there will be channel inventory destocking in the back half of the year; we expect commercial industry water heater volumes will increase approximately 2% as pandemic-impacted businesses reopen and new production and replacement installations come back online; we believe the demand we saw in the last few months was partially driven by a pre-buy activity in advance of the price increases. 
In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong. Our strategy to continue to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher-priced products across all of our product categories driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $51 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. Boiler sales grew 24% in the first half of 2021. The comparison will be tougher in the back half of the year, and we expect boiler sales will grow by low double digits for the full year compared with last year. We project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We project margins in this business to grow by 100 basis points, above the nearly 10% achieved in 2020. 
We continue to experience inflation across our supply channel, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased 23% since our third water heater price increase became effective on June 1. We announced a fourth price increase in late June on water heaters effective August 1 at the rate between 10% and 12%. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.75% and 23%.  And Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 8%. Our procurement and operation team faced continued challenges in the second quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics throughout the remainder of the year, these challenges are moderating, and I have confidence in our team to continue to navigate through this difficult environment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

So we're pleased with the 26% growth. You got to recall last year, China came out of the pandemic earlier than North America.

Our global A.O. Smith team delivered second quarter EPS of $0.73 on a 30% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution and operational agility despite supply chain and logistic challenges, along with rapidly rising material costs. I am thankful for my fellow A.O. Smith employees who tirelessly navigated through the pandemic, followed by weather-related production disruptions and continue to navigate supply chain constraints. I appreciate the creativity and the collaboration of our team to find solutions to keep our customers supply with water heating and water treatment products. 
Boiler sales grew 35%, driven by strong demand as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020 as well as an active education end market. For reference, our boiler sales were down 15% in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. North America water treatment grew 17%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products which provide safe drinking water in the home. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well in the quarter and online promotional shopping days also boosted sales. 
Consistent with our strategy to build out distribution for North America water treatment, we acquired Master Water Conditioning Corporation. The acquisition supplements our presence in the Northeast, and we are excited to add expertise in local water condition and solutions in this region to our family. Our North America water treatment sales, including this acquisition are expected to be over $200 million in 2021. 
Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters increased in the second quarter. We believe the strong demand is a continued result of extended lead times caused by production constraints due to strain in the supply chain, buying in advance of price increases and incremental new home construction. 
After our weather-related disruptions in production, which we talked about on our first quarter call, we have seen month-over-month sequential improvement, and certain of our suppliers recently noted they see moderation of demand and supply imbalances. But we remain vigilant as the imbalances are spotty, and we expect supply chain challenges to be with us through the remainder of the year. 
In response to continued material and logistic cost increases, we recently announced a fourth price increase of between 10% and 12% effective August 1. In China, sales increased over 26% in local currency, driven by growth in each of our major product categories, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, including commercial and replacement filters. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the second quarter beginning on Slide 4."

Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42 per share in 2020. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $604 million increased 26% compared with the second quarter of 2020, driven by higher volumes of water heaters, boilers and water treatment products and inflation-related price increases. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 39% from the second quarter of 2020. Growth in each of our major product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 26% in the quarter. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $20 million. 
India sales more than doubled in the second quarter despite the recent surge in cases of the virus in that region. North America segment earnings of $142 million increased 34% compared with the second quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher volumes and inflation-related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating margin of 23.5% improved compared with the second quarter of 2020 segment margin of 21.9%. 
Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million increased significantly compared with the loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by shutdowns and reduced consumer spending resulting from the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs were partially offset by the absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. As a result, segment operating margin of 8.5% improved from a negative 3% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher than last year largely due to management incentives. Our effective tax rate of 21.9% was essentially the same as last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $196 million during the first half was higher than during the first half of 2020. Higher earnings in 2021 compared with the prior year were partially offset by a larger investment in working capital during the first half of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020. Our cash balances totaled $582 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $476 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.5%, as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of June. Through June 30, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of common stock for a total of $198 million. 
Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.70 and $2.76 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 5% compared with our prior quarter full year guidance. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $500 million and $525 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in the prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. 
Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumed $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9. Kevin?"

That being said, we raised our 2021 top line growth expectation and now project an increase of between 17% and 18%, driven by strong demand and price increases implemented in response to rising material and transportation costs. 
Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. With 7 months of visibility, we've upgraded our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to increase approximately 3% compared with last year. We expect continued resilient replacement demand and growth in new home construction. With our fourth price increase in the market and continued consumer demand, we no longer believe there will be channel inventory destocking in the back half of the year. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will increase approximately 2% as pandemic-impacted businesses reopen and new production and replacement installations come back online. We believe the demand we saw in the last few months was partially driven by a pre-buy activity in advance of the price increases. 
In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong. Our strategy to continue to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher-priced products across all of our product categories driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $51 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. 
Boiler sales grew 24% in the first half of 2021. The comparison will be tougher in the back half of the year, and we expect boiler sales will grow by low double digits for the full year compared with last year. We project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We project margins in this business to grow by 100 basis points, above the nearly 10% achieved in 2020. 
We continue to experience inflation across our supply channel, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased 23% since our third water heater price increase became effective on June 1. We announced a fourth price increase in late June on water heaters effective August 1 at the rate between 10% and 12%. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.75% and 23%.  And Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 8%. 
Our procurement and operation team faced continued challenges in the second quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics throughout the remainder of the year, these challenges are moderating, and I have confidence in our team to continue to navigate through this difficult environment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

We felt good about it a year ago, and it significantly improved. It's at its lowest point in 5 years. And I would say that it's probably it's as fresh as it's been. So we're in a great inventory position in the channel in China. Let me help frame kind of the sales growth for the quarter. So we're up 26% in organic local currency. But if you kind of take a look at that, last year, we did have some headwind on channel inventories coming down. When we look at sellout and demand for this quarter, we're probably up about mid-single digits. We're right in that range. And it's across our whole portfolio of products. So we're pleased with the 26% growth. You got to recall last year; China came out of the pandemic earlier than North America. It got gutted too and it came out of it a little sooner, but that was a quarter that was building from April, May and June. So mid-single digits up for the quarter, and we kind of -- when we think about the rest of the year, we're kind of looking at something roughly in that same range through the back half of the year."

Our global A.O. Smith team delivered second quarter EPS of $0.73 on a 30% increase in sales, demonstrating solid execution and operational agility despite supply chain and logistic challenges, along with rapidly rising material costs. I am thankful for my fellow A.O. Smith employees who tirelessly navigated through the pandemic, followed by weather-related production disruptions and continue to navigate supply chain constraints. I appreciate the creativity and the collaboration of our team to find solutions to keep our customers supply with water heating and water treatment products. 
Boiler sales grew 35%, driven by strong demand as a result of completed projects carried over from 2020 as well as an active education end market. For reference, our boiler sales were down 15% in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. North America water treatment grew 17%, driven by continued consumer demand for home improvement products which provide safe drinking water in the home. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well in the quarter and online promotional shopping days also boosted sales. 
Consistent with our strategy to build out distribution for North America water treatment, we acquired Master Water Conditioning Corporation. The acquisition supplements our presence in the Northeast, and we are excited to add expertise in local water condition and solutions in this region to our family. Our North America water treatment sales, including this acquisition are expected to be over $200 million in 2021. 
Our volumes of U.S. tank residential water heaters increased in the second quarter. We believe the strong demand is a continued result of extended lead times caused by production constraints due to strain in the supply chain, buying in advance of price increases and incremental new home construction. 
After our weather-related disruptions in production, which we talked about on our first quarter call, we have seen month-over-month sequential improvement, and certain of our suppliers recently noted they see moderation of demand and supply imbalances. But we remain vigilant as the imbalances are spotty, and we expect supply chain challenges to be with us through the remainder of the year. 
In response to continued material and logistic cost increases, we recently announced a fourth price increase of between 10% and 12% effective August 1. In China, sales increased over 26% in local currency, driven by growth in each of our major product categories, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, including commercial and replacement filters. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on the second quarter beginning on Slide 4."

Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42",610,"Thank you, Kevin. Record second quarter sales of $860 million increased 30% compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Second quarter net earnings increased 74% to $118 million or $0.73 per share compared with $68 million or $0.42 per share in 2020. 
Please turn to Slide 5. Sales in the North America segment of $604 million increased 26% compared with the second quarter of 2020, driven by higher volumes of water heaters, boilers and water treatment products and inflation-related price increases. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 39% from the second quarter of 2020. Growth in each of our major product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 26% in the quarter. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $20 million. 
India sales more than doubled in the second quarter despite the recent surge in cases of the virus in that region. North America segment earnings of $142 million increased 34% compared with the second quarter of 2020. The impact to earnings from higher volumes and inflation-related price increases was partially offset by higher material and freight costs. As a result of these factors, segment operating margin of 23.5% improved compared with the second quarter of 2020 segment margin of 21.9%. 
Rest of the World segment earnings of $22 million increased significantly compared with the loss of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, which was negatively impacted by shutdowns and reduced consumer spending resulting from the pandemic. In China, higher volumes and lower selling and administrative costs were partially offset by the absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. As a result, segment operating margin of 8.5% improved from a negative 3% in the second quarter of 2020. 
Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher than last year largely due to management incentives. Our effective tax rate of 21.9% was essentially the same as last year. 
Please turn to Slide 7. Cash provided by operations of $196 million during the first half was higher than during the first half of 2020. Higher earnings in 2021 compared with the prior year were partially offset by a larger investment in working capital during the first half of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020. Our cash balances totaled $582 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $476 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.5%, as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of June. Through June 30, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of common stock for a total of $198 million. 
Please turn to Slide 8. We upgraded our 2021 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.70 and $2.76 per share. The midpoint of our range represents an increase of 5% compared with our prior quarter full year guidance. We expect cash flow from operations in 2021 to be between $500 million and $525 million compared with $560 million in 2020. We expect higher earnings in 2021 will be more than offset by higher investments in working capital than in the prior year. Our 2021 capital spending plans are between $85 million and $90 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is assumed to be approximately 23% in 2021. 
Average outstanding diluted shares of 160 million assumed $400 million worth of shares are repurchased in 2021. 
I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance assumptions beginning on Slide 9. Kevin?"

That being said, we raised our 2021 top line growth expectation and now project an increase of between 17% and 18%, driven by strong demand and price increases implemented in response to rising material and transportation costs. 
Our revenue outlook for 2021 includes the following assumptions. With 7 months of visibility, we've upgraded our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to increase approximately 3% compared with last year. We expect continued resilient replacement demand and growth in new home construction. With our fourth price increase in the market and continued consumer demand, we no longer believe there will be channel inventory destocking in the back half of the year. We expect commercial industry water heater volumes will increase approximately 2% as pandemic-impacted businesses reopen and new production and replacement installations come back online. We believe the demand we saw in the last few months was partially driven by a pre-buy activity in advance of the price increases. 
In China, it is encouraging to see sales of our products continue to remain strong. Our strategy to continue to expand distribution to Tier 4 through 6 cities is on track. We see improvement in consumer trends towards trading up for higher-priced products across all of our product categories driven by differentiated new products launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increases in local currency sales between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $51 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. 
Boiler sales grew 24% in the first half of 2021. The comparison will be tougher in the back half of the year, and we expect boiler sales will grow by low double digits for the full year compared with last year. We project 13% to 14% full year sales growth in North America water treatment. We believe the megatrends of healthy and safe drinking water as well as reduction of single-use plastic bottles will continue to drive consumer demand for our point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. We project margins in this business to grow by 100 basis points, above the nearly 10% achieved in 2020. 
We continue to experience inflation across our supply channel, particularly steel and logistic costs. Steel has increased 23% since our third water heater price increase became effective on June 1. We announced a fourth price increase in late June on water heaters effective August 1 at the rate between 10% and 12%. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.75% and 23%.  And Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 8%. 
Our procurement and operation team faced continued challenges in the second quarter. And while we expect continued headwinds in supply chain and logistics throughout the remainder of the year, these challenges are moderating, and I have confidence in our team to continue to navigate through this difficult environment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

And as you know, steel is the major part of water heating cost for us. There's other costs, including freight and filament and so forth, but steel is the largest part. So when we kind of look at the cadence of the cost through the year, into the fourth quarter, we're going to be -- and we have good visibility into the fourth quarter because, as you know, we've got 90- to 100-day visibility forward on what we're going to be paying for steel. Our cost Q4 year-over-year is going to be 2.5 to 3x higher on just steel alone. So I just want to kind of frame that. The other businesses outside of water heating certainly have seen some cost increases, and we've got price increases at various points, but certainly, the water heater side bears the brunt of that steel increase."

So last year, it was exactly opposite. It was 48% because of all the headwinds that the industry had in production in Q2, but it was 48% front half and 52% back half. And when we looked at the full year, we went back to kind of the normal cadence, too.

But if you kind of take a look at that, last year, we did have some headwind on channel inventories coming down. When we look at sellout and demand for this quarter, we're probably up about mid-single digits. We're right in that range. And it's across our whole portfolio of products. So we're pleased with the 26% growth. You got to recall last year, China came out of the pandemic earlier than North America. Got into it and it came out of it a little sooner, but that was a quarter that was building from April, May and June.

And our team did what they needed to do to protect our employees but more importantly, really developed a strong relationship on the online segment of the business, which helped drive some of the sales we're talking about. And even in the pandemic, we introduced new products, both in water treatment and in water heating that have done exceptionally well. So we're calling it out because quite frankly, it's a phenomenal job by a team that really had severe headwinds throughout the second quarter and throughout the first part of the year. And we're looking for the back half to get a bit better. And again, as Chuck said, that's where we get about 50% of our sales over the last 4 months."

Smith Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4. We're a global leader in applying innovation and energy efficiency solutions to water heating",1028,"Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4. We're a global leader in applying innovation and energy efficiency solutions to water heating and treating products that we manufacture and market worldwide with annual sales of approximately $3 billion. In market-leading brands, our products including water heaters, boilers and water treatment systems manufactured in 22 facilities across the globe. North America is our largest and most profitable market, followed by China, which accounts for 25% of sales. 
Turning to Slide 5 and our quarterly results. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our team delivered a record-setting quarter in a turbulent macro environment. Demand for water heaters in North America remains very strong. Our Rest of World segment performed well in the quarter led by China, delivering operating margins of approximately 10%. Costs continue to increase sequentially, and in response, we have taken appropriate pricing actions. We continue to successfully navigate the supply chain and transportation issues facing most companies and have improved our delivery performance since the first quarter. We acquired giant water heater manufacturer in Canada, growing our market share in North America and welcoming a talented group of employees to the A.O. Smith family. And finally, based on our strong performance and continued demand, we're raising our full year outlook for sales and earnings. 
Please turn to Slide 6. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered record third quarter EPS of $0.82, a 26% increase that was driven in part by a record 20% increase in sales compared with the third quarter of 2020. Demand for our products is robust, particularly in North America, resulting in record quarterly sales and operating earnings. We achieved this strong performance as a result of continued solid execution, despite the challenging environment of component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and materials and transportation cost inflation. I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow A.O. Smith employees for their dedication and ingenuity as we work to overcome these challenges to meet strong market demand and deliver for our customers. North America water heater sales grew 24%, benefiting from both pricing actions and strong demand. Commercial unit industry demand increased by more than 10% due to resumption of new construction and replacement in the hospitality end market. Residential water heater unit demand also increased in the quarter. In addition, sequential improvements to our product delivery performance enabled us to improve our share position, which was temporarily lag in our expectations earlier this year. Our North America boiler sales grew 7%, driven by new construction and replacement demand as well as new products. We ended September with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and October continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient boilers. We believe green building incentives and favorable return on investment outcomes contributed to strong demand for our condensing boilers. As natural gas prices increase, the return on investment for highly efficient products becomes more compelling, and we are well positioned to capture share. 
North America water treatment sales grew 8% in the third quarter. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well. We believe our dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, sales increased 12% in local currency. Each of our major product categories grew year-over-year, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products, along with replacement filters. We estimate that replacement demand for our water heaters in China is about 50% of our units sold. Our newer categories, including NatoSmiths branded commercial water treatment as well as Range Hoods and Cook Tops continue to gain traction. As a result, we project that combined sales of these products will top $50 million this year. 
Please turn to Slide 7 and an overview of our recent acquisition. We are very pleased to welcome the team from Giant Factories to A. O. Smith. Giant is a Canada-based manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters with a strong position in residential electric water heaters, a trailing 12-month sales of approximately USD 105 million. Giants fit squarely in our core North America water heater business and is consistent with our strategy to grow through acquisition and further penetrate existing markets. The transaction met several of our acquisition criteria, including expanding our presence and growing our core water heater business in the stable Canada market; leveraging our existing presence in Canada; adding to our sustainability efforts, given most of giant water heaters are fueled by renewable energy sources; and the expectation that it will be accretive to EPS in 2022 with an ROIC in excess of our cost of the capital in 2023, ahead of our 3-year goal for acquisitions. We are excited to welcome our colleagues from Giant to the A. O. Smith team and look forward to continued excellent customer experience that they have become going for. 
I'm now on Slide 8. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight some of our ongoing ESG and sustainability efforts. In China, we have reduced energy use in both our nonproduction activities and our production facilities. As outlined in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we were honored to be awarded the rating of Model Enterprise in 2020 by the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone as an environmental protection pace setter. This distinction recognizes the depth of our environmental focus and operational processes to measure and reduce our environmental impact since 2016. As an industry leader, committed to innovation and investment in more environmentally sustainable and efficient technologies to heat and treat water, we published a white paper and analytical tool in September to help federal, state and local policymakers navigate the complexities of building decarbonization policies currently being designed and implemented around the country as part of a broader economy-wide effort to meet U.S. greenhouse gas reduction goals. An executive summary of the white paper is available in the Sustainability section of our website. 
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter."

Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 80% of the increase. Higher volumes in water heaters and boilers were driven by strong replacement and new construction demand. The higher volumes of water treatment products added to segment growth also. North America segment earnings of $152 million increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes was offset somewhat by higher material and freight costs. Pricing actions led rapidly rising steel costs, which resulted in a lower segment operating margin of 23.1% compared with the third quarter of 2020 segment market. 
Moving to Slide 11. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 19% year-over-year, approximately 60% of which was due to volume increases. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Growth in each of our product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by channel inventory changes, which remained at levels similar to the beginning of the year. Our products with higher selling prices, particularly our super quiet gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water, contributed to sales gains. India sales grew 38% in the quarter as the economy begin to regain its footing after the COVID-19 delta variant wave subsided in that region. Rest of World earnings of $27 million increased 60% from the third quarter of 2020. In China, higher volumes were partially offset by employee incentive costs and higher advertising as well as an absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. Segment operating margin improved to 10% compared with the third quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage from higher volumes. 
Please turn to Slide 12. We generated strong free cash flow of $332 million during the first 9 months, 13% higher than during the same period in 2020, partially impacted by a larger investment in working capital to support demand levels. Free cash flow conversion was 95%, slightly below our historical performance of 100%.  Our cash balance totaled $685 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $579 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.3% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of September. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enables us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which is now $0.28 per share. This marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend increases and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return value to shareholders through sustained and increasing dividend. Year-to-date through September 30, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $212 million and have the ability to repurchase 5.4 million shares more on our current authorization. We took a pause in our measured stock repurchase pace in the third quarter as we enter the blackout period due to the acquisition of Giant. We plan to resume our repurchase program in early November, targeting $400 million for a total share repurchase in 2021. 
Let's now turn to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that we believe can return our cost of capital in 3 years. Giant is a great example. The purchase price of USD 192 million represents a multiple of approximately 9.5x projected 2023 adjusted EBITDA and the acquisition returns our cost of capital in the second full year, this is inclusive of the present value of an expected tax benefit of approximately $6.5 million that will be realized by treating the transaction as a purchase of assets for tax purposes and projected operating synergies of approximately $5 million achieved over a 2-year period. We expect no impact to fourth quarter EPS due to customary purchase accounting adjustments and onetime transaction expenses. Purchase accounting headwinds are expected to run into the first quarter of 2022, as a result of Giant's conservative practice of carrying high levels of inventory, which are valued as of the acquisition date by marking the value to market. Giant's practice of carrying safety stock has served them well, especially during the current challenges within the supply chain and rapidly rising costs. We continue to finalize our purchase accounting and currently project the acquisition will add between $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2022.  
Please turn to Slide 14 and our updated full year 2021 outlook. We are now projecting full year sales to increase between 20% and 21% year-over-year. Based on this updated forecast and improved profitability, we are increasing our EPS range to between $2.86 and $2.90 per share. The midpoint of that range represents an increase of 5% compared with our previous guidance. We expect cash flow from operations for the year to be between $550 million and $575 million compared with $560 million in 2020. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million, and we expect to generate strong free cash flow of approximately $490 million with an over 100% conversion rate. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics. Steel indices have increased 100% since the beginning of the year. We announced a fifth price increase on water heaters to be effective November 15 at a rate of up to 8.5%. These 2021 price increases are projected to have a cumulative effect on water heating prices of approximately 50% when fully effective in late December of this year. Based on that, we are raising the lower end of our North America segment margin guidance to between 22.75% and 23% and an improvement from our previous outlook. And Rest of the World segment margins to be approximately 8%, which is unchanged. Our updated outlook is based on key assumptions, including [ 5 ] announced inflation-related price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters as we exit 2021. Mid- to high single-digit inflation-related price increases in the remainder of our global portfolio. Strong demand in backlog in North America for all of our water heating product categories, driven by growth and replacement demand and new construction spending, along with the price increase announcements in our water heater and boiler end markets. No material changes in the current macro environment. 
As for other housekeeping assumptions, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22%. Important to note, our effective tax rate of 20.9% in the third quarter was lower than the prior year as it was favorably impacted by approximately $4 million or $0.03 per share, relating to amending previously filed tax return along with the change in our geographic earnings mix. Finally, we expect to end the year at outstanding diluted shares of 161 million. 
I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our topline growth outlook for 2021, which is on Slide 15. Kevin?"

China performance has shown consistency in the past 4 quarters. We are on track with our strategy to continue to expand distribution to smaller Tier 4, 5 and 6 cities in China. Consumer trends show increased demand for higher-priced products across all our categories, driven by differentiated new products that we have launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increase in local currency sale between 20% and 22% in China. We assume trended currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $54 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. After currency impact, the majority of the projected sales growth is driven by a reduction in channel inventory levels in 2020. Power shortages in China have been sporadic. To date, we have had minimal disruptions to our operations, our managing through shortages by reducing energy use and nonproduction-related activities and supplementing power with generators on an as-need basis. 
Boilers sales grew 17% this year through September 2021. We are encouraged by the stability of our record backlog and expect 13% growth in boilers for the full year. We project 12% growth in full year sales for our North America water treatment products. This is slightly lower than our July outlook of 13.5% due to deceleration of growth in online and retail sales. However, we believe sales growth for our point to use and [indiscernible] water treatment systems will continue to be driven by consumer demand for safe drinking water and reduce single-use plastic bottles. We estimate 2021 market growth of around 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 16. Thanks to the tremendous effort by our procurement and operation teams, our supply chain is stabilizing. Our manufacturing lead times remain consistent since midyear. Through our focus and determination, we believe we will close out the year on a high note and continue strong into 2022. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

I mean that's a 20-plus year investment for us, and we're building a strong brand, strong distribution, a terrific record for innovation. That strategy remains intact, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we mentioned in the past, we're continuing to invest in lower-tier cities. On the store front, we're continuing to monitor the productivity of our Tier 1, Tier 2 stores. We think we're there. We've adjusted maybe 100 to 150 and exited this last year. And then we're really building out our Tier 4 through 6 Tier cities. This year, we're up about 3,000 stores and want to qualify that a bit. It's not the same type of store as you would see in Tier 1, Tier 2, but they're mainly counters. But having 3,000 counters in an area that has grown and expanding is proving to be a very beneficial for our top line and long-term success in China. So overall, the commitment in China hasn't changed. Our investment in our brand continues, and we will continue to focus on innovation, our investment in R&D, again, continues to move forward. So again, some minor adjustments, moving into some other tier cities, making some adjustments in our current portfolio of stores. All on track. All we've been doing for the last 12 to 18 months. So strategically, we're still heading down the same path we have. I do want to come back to property development. 
And just to remind everybody, we really have no direct exposure in that particular segment. We could hit some, I would say, short-term headwinds as they work through some restructuring there, but also approximately 18 million new homes are required in China every year. That's quite an opportunity for us still regardless of what's happening in the property development market. So still a lot of opportunity in China regardless of some of the restructuring they'll have to do in their property sector."

Smith Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4.

I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4. We're a global leader in applying innovation and energy-efficient solutions to water heating and treating products that we manufacture and market worldwide with annual sales of approximately $3 billion. In market-leading brands, our products including water heaters, boilers and water treatment systems manufactured in 22 facilities across the globe. North America is our largest and most profitable market, followed by China, which accounts for 25% of sales.  
Turning to Slide 5 and our quarterly results. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our team delivered a record-setting quarter in a turbulent macro environment. Demand for water heaters in North America remains very strong. Our Rest of World segment performed well in the quarter led by China, delivering operating margins of approximately 10%. Costs continue to increase sequentially, and in response, we have taken appropriate pricing actions. We continue to successfully navigate the supply chain and transportation issues facing most companies and have improved our delivery performance since the first quarter. We acquired Giant the water heater manufacturer in Canada, growing our market share in North America and welcoming a talented group of employees to the A.O. Smith family. And finally, based on our strong performance and continued demand, we're raising our full year outlook for sales and earnings.  
Please turn to Slide 6. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered record third quarter EPS of $0.82, a 26% increase that was driven in part by a record 20% increase in sales compared with the third quarter of 2020. Demand for our products is robust, particularly in North America, resulting in record quarterly sales and operating earnings. We achieved this strong performance as a result of continued solid execution, despite the challenging environment of component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and materials and transportation cost inflation. I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow A.O. Smith employees for their dedication and ingenuity as we work to overcome these challenges to meet strong market demand and deliver for our customers. North America water heater sales grew 24%, benefiting from both pricing actions and strong demand. Commercial unit industry demand increased by more than 10% due to resumption of new construction and replacement in the hospitality end market. Residential water heater unit demand also increased in the quarter. In addition, sequential improvements to our product delivery performance enabled us to improve our share position, which was temporarily lag in our expectations earlier this year. Our North America boiler sales grew 7%, driven by new construction and replacement demand as well as new products. We ended September with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and October continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient boilers. We believe green building incentives and favorable return on investment outcomes contributed to strong demand for our condensing boilers. As natural gas prices increase, the return on investment for highly efficient products becomes more compelling, and we are well positioned to capture share.  
North America water treatment sales grew 8% in the third quarter. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well. We believe our dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, sales increased 12% in local currency. Each of our major product categories grew year-over-year, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products, along with replacement filters. We estimate that replacement demand for our water heaters in China is about 50% of our units sold. Our newer categories, including A.O. Smith branded commercial water treatment as well as Range Hoods and Cook Tops continue to gain traction. As a result, we project that combined sales of these products will top $50 million this year.  
Please turn to Slide 7 and an overview of our recent acquisition. We are very pleased to welcome the team from Giant Factories to A. O. Smith. Giant is a Canada-based manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters with a strong position in residential electric water heaters, a trailing 12-month sales of approximately USD 105 million. Giant fits squarely in our core North America water heater business and is consistent with our strategy to grow through acquisition and further penetrate existing markets. The transaction met several of our acquisition criteria, including expanding our presence and growing our core water heater business in the stable Canada market, leveraging our existing presence in Canada; adding to our sustainability efforts, given most of Giant water heaters are fueled by renewable energy sources; and the expectation that it will be accretive to EPS in 2022 with an ROIC in excess of our cost of the capital in 2023, ahead of our 3-year goal for acquisitions. We are excited to welcome our colleagues from Giant to the A. O. Smith team and look forward to continued excellent customer experience that they have come -- become known for.  
I'm now on Slide 8. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight some of our ongoing ESG and sustainability efforts. In China, we have reduced energy use in both our non-production activities and our production facilities. As outlined in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we were honored to be awarded the rating of  ""Model Enterprise"" in 2020 by the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone as an environmental protection pace setter. This distinction recognizes the depth of our environmental focus and operational processes to measure and reduce our environmental impact since 2016. As an industry leader, committed to innovation and investment in more environmentally sustainable and efficient technologies to heat and treat water, we published a white paper and analytical tool in September to help Federal, State and Local policymakers navigate the complexities of building decarbonization policies currently being designed and implemented around the country as part of a broader economy-wide effort to meet U.S. greenhouse gas reduction goals. An executive summary of the white paper is available in the Sustainability section of our website.  
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter."

Smith Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 9.

We delivered record third quarter sales of $915 million, up 20% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand and inflation-related pricing actions. These higher volumes led to third quarter net earnings of $132 million or $0.82 per share, which is a 25% increase compared with net earnings of $105 million or $0.65 per share in 2020.  
Please turn to Slide 10. Sales in the North America segment rose to $658 million, a 21% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 80% of the increase. Higher volumes in water heaters and boilers were driven by strong replacement and new construction demand. The higher volumes of water treatment products added to segment growth also. North America segment earnings of $152 million increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes was offset somewhat by higher material and freight costs. Pricing actions led rapidly rising steel costs, which resulted in a lower segment operating margin of 23.1% compared with the third quarter of 2020 segment market.  
Moving to Slide 11. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 19% year-over-year, approximately 60% of which was due to volume increases. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Growth in each of our product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by channel inventory changes, which remained at levels similar to the beginning of the year. Our products with higher selling prices, particularly our super-quiet gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water, contributed to sales gains. 
India sales grew 38% in the quarter as the economy begin to regain its footing after the COVID-19 delta variant wave subsided in that region. Rest of the World earnings of $27 million increased 60% from the third quarter of 2020. In China, higher volumes were partially offset by employee incentive costs and higher advertising as well as an absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. Segment operating margin improved to 10% compared with the third quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage from higher volumes.  
Please turn to Slide 12. We generated strong free cash flow of $332 million during the first 9 months, 13% higher than during the same period in 2020, partially impacted by a larger investment in working capital to support demand levels. Free cash flow conversion was 95%, slightly below our historical performance of a 100%.  Our cash balance totaled $685 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $579 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.3% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of September. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enables us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which is now $0.28 per share. This marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend increases and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return value to shareholders through sustained and increasing dividend. Year-to-date through September 30, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $212 million and have the ability to repurchase 5.4 million shares more on our current authorization. We took a pause in our measured stock repurchase pace in the third quarter as we enter the blackout period due to the acquisition of Giant. We plan to resume our repurchase program in early November, targeting $400 million for a total share repurchase in 2021.  
Let's now turn to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that we believe can return our cost of capital in 3 years. Giant is a great example. The purchase price of USD 192 million represents a multiple of approximately 9.5x projected 2023 adjusted EBITDA, and the acquisition returns our cost of capital in the second full year, this is inclusive of the present value of an expected tax benefit of approximately $6.5 million that will be realized by treating the transaction as a purchase of assets for tax purposes and projected operating synergies of approximately $5 million achieved over a 2-year period. We expect no impact to fourth quarter EPS due to customary purchase accounting adjustments and one-time transaction expenses. Purchase accounting headwinds are expected to run into the first quarter of 2022, as a result of Giant's conservative practice of carrying high levels of inventory, which are valued as of the acquisition date by marking the value to market. Giant's practice of carrying safety stock has served them well, especially during the current challenges within the supply chain and rapidly rising costs. We continue to finalize our purchase accounting and currently project the acquisition will add between $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2022.   
Please turn to Slide 14, at our updated full year 2021 outlook. We are now projecting full year sales to increase between 20% and 21% year-over-year. Based on this updated forecast and improved profitability, we are increasing our EPS range to between $2.86 and $2.90 per share. The mid-point of that range represents an increase of 5% compared with our previous guidance. We expect cash flow from operations for the year to be between $550 million and $575 million compared with $560 million in 2020. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million, and we expect to generate strong free cash flow of approximately $490 million with an over 100% conversion rate. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics. Steel indices have increased 100% since the beginning of the year. We announced a fifth price increase on water heaters to be effective November 15 at a rate of up to 8.5%. These 2021 price increases are projected to have a cumulative effect on water heating prices of approximately 50% when fully effective in late December of this year. Based on that, we are raising the lower end of our North America segment margin guidance to between 22.75% and 23% and an improvement from our previous outlook. And Rest of the World segment margins to be approximately 8%, which is unchanged. Our updated outlook is based on key assumptions, including I've announced inflation-related price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters as we exit 2021. Mid- to high single-digit inflation-related price increases in the remainder of our global portfolio. Strong demand in backlog in North America for all of our water heating product categories, driven by growth and replacement demand and new construction spending, along with the price increase announcements in our water heater and boiler end markets. No material changes -- and no material changes in the current macro environment. 
As for other housekeeping assumptions, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22%. Important to note, our effective tax rate of 20.9% in the third quarter was lower than the prior year as it was favorably impacted by approximately $4 million or $0.03 per share, relating to amending previously filed tax return along with the change in our geographic earnings mix. Finally, we expect to end the year at outstanding diluted shares of 161 million. 
I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our top line growth outlook for 2021, which is on Slide 15. Kevin?"

China performance has shown consistency in the past 4 quarters. We are on track with our strategy to continue to expand distribution to smaller Tier 4, 5 and 6 cities in China. Consumer trends show increased demand for higher-priced products across all our categories, driven by differentiated new products that we have launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increase in local currency sale between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China  currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $54 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. After currency impact, the majority of the projected sales growth is driven by a reduction in channel inventory levels in 2020. Power shortages in China have been sporadic. To date, we have had minimal disruptions to our operations, our managing through shortages by reducing energy use and nonproduction-related activities and supplementing power with generators on an as-need basis. 
Boilers sales grew 17% this year through September 2021. We are encouraged by the stability of our record backlog and expect 13% growth in boilers for the full year. We project 12% growth in full year sales for our North America water treatment products. This is slightly lower than our July outlook of 13.5% due to deceleration of growth in online and retail sales. However, we believe sales growth for our point to use and point of entry water treatment systems will continue to be driven by consumer demand for safe drinking water and reduce single-use plastic bottles. We estimate 2021 market growth of around 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 16. Thanks to the tremendous effort by our procurement and operation teams, our supply chain is stabilizing. Our manufacturing lead times remained consistent since mid-year. Through our focus and determination, we believe we will close out the year on a high note and continue strong into 2022. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Last year, we kind of view as there was some pent-up demand, some really strong online sales and a rather strong quarter for year-over-year comps. So probably less than last year. So we're kind of seeing it as somewhere in between. So we expect it to tick up from Q3, not quite as strong as last year. We're pleased with our share. I think we've said in the past, it's difficult to measure, but we're very pleased with our specialty stores and our distributors' performance in the marketplace, which is really hard to capture on an industry-wide basis."

So I mentioned a little earlier, our price increase effective November 15 really won't help us in the fourth quarter. We would expect that to start coming into the financials at the end of the year, beginning of next year. But what we're seeing is, the impact of the significantly higher steel costs that's been ramping up through the year. So when we look at our steel costs for Q4, sequentially, it will be up from Q3, will also be -- steel costs are about 2.5 to 3x more than what we were paying last year at that point in time in the fourth quarter. So it's a pretty significant ramp. So what we're seeing on the margin, I guess, headwind in Q4 in North America is just those costs hitting us faster than some of the price increases become effective."

I mean that's a 20-plus year investment for us, and we're building a strong brand, strong distribution, a terrific record for innovation. That strategy remains intact, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we mentioned in the past, we're continuing to invest in lower-tier cities. On the store fronts, we're continuing to monitor the productivity of our Tier 1, Tier 2 stores. We think we're there. We've adjusted maybe 100 to 150 and exited this last year. And then we're really building out our Tier 4 through 6 Tier cities. This year, we're up about 3,000 stores and want to qualify that a bit. It's not the same type of store as you would see in Tier 1, Tier 2, but they're mainly counters. But having 3,000 counters in a area that has grown and expanding is proving to be a very beneficial for our top line and long-term success in China. So it's overall, the commitment in China hasn't changed. Our investment in our brand continues, and we will continue to focus on innovation, our investment in R&D, again, continues to move forward. So again, some minor adjustments, moving into some other tier cities, making some adjustments in our current portfolio of stores. All on track. All we've been doing for the last 12 to 18 months. So strategically, we're still heading down the same path we have. I do want to come back to property development. 
And just to remind everybody, we really have no direct exposure in that particular segment. We could hit some, I would say, short-term headwinds as they work through some restructuring there, but also approximately 18 million new homes are required in China every year. That's quite an opportunity for us still regardless of what's happening in the property development market. So still a lot of opportunity in China regardless of some of the restructuring they'll have to do in their property sector."

So again, when we look at this as more of a temporary headwind, short-term. We'll see how the property market kind of works its way out of where it's at today, and how the Chinese government gets involved. But I guess I'll comment that even within this, a consumer sentiment that's down a little bit, we have seen our consumers still pay up for premium products. And in the quarter, we had all 3 of our product -- core product categories have a spike trade up, and that's on water heaters, both tankless and electric as well as water treatment. So my view is, there is still opportunity regardless of how the market is performing at a point in time. But there is clearly a short-term headwind that we'll have to work through, and hopefully, the products that we have and how we bring new innovations to market will help us overcome most of those."

I'd like to start today's call with a quick snapshot of A. O. Smith. I'm on Slide 4. We're a global leader in applying innovation and energy-efficient solutions to water heating and treating products that we manufacture and market worldwide with annual sales of approximately $3 billion. In market-leading brands, our products including water heaters, boilers and water treatment systems manufactured in 22 facilities across the globe. North America is our largest and most profitable market, followed by China, which accounts for 25% of sales.  
Turning to Slide 5 and our quarterly results. We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Our team delivered a record-setting quarter in a turbulent macro environment. Demand for water heaters in North America remains very strong. Our Rest of World segment performed well in the quarter led by China, delivering operating margins of approximately 10%. Costs continue to increase sequentially, and in response, we have taken appropriate pricing actions. We continue to successfully navigate the supply chain and transportation issues facing most companies and have improved our delivery performance since the first quarter. We acquired Giant the water heater manufacturer in Canada, growing our market share in North America and welcoming a talented group of employees to the A.O. Smith family. And finally, based on our strong performance and continued demand, we're raising our full year outlook for sales and earnings.  
Please turn to Slide 6. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered record third quarter EPS of $0.82, a 26% increase that was driven in part by a record 20% increase in sales compared with the third quarter of 2020. Demand for our products is robust, particularly in North America, resulting in record quarterly sales and operating earnings. We achieved this strong performance as a result of continued solid execution, despite the challenging environment of component shortages, logistical bottlenecks and materials and transportation cost inflation. I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow A.O. Smith employees for their dedication and ingenuity as we work to overcome these challenges to meet strong market demand and deliver for our customers. North America water heater sales grew 24%, benefiting from both pricing actions and strong demand. Commercial unit industry demand increased by more than 10% due to resumption of new construction and replacement in the hospitality end market. Residential water heater unit demand also increased in the quarter. In addition, sequential improvements to our product delivery performance enabled us to improve our share position, which was temporarily lag in our expectations earlier this year. Our North America boiler sales grew 7%, driven by new construction and replacement demand as well as new products. We ended September with a record backlog, largely composed of commercial condensing boilers and October continues to generate strong order rates for these market-leading energy-efficient boilers. We believe green building incentives and favorable return on investment outcomes contributed to strong demand for our condensing boilers. As natural gas prices increase, the return on investment for highly efficient products becomes more compelling, and we are well positioned to capture share.  
North America water treatment sales grew 8% in the third quarter. Our water quality dealers performed particularly well. We believe our dealers have been outperforming the market and gaining market share. In China, sales increased 12% in local currency. Each of our major product categories grew year-over-year, including electric and gas tankless water heaters and residential and commercial water treatment products, along with replacement filters. We estimate that replacement demand for our water heaters in China is about 50% of our units sold. Our newer categories, including A.O. Smith branded commercial water treatment as well as Range Hoods and Cook Tops continue to gain traction. As a result, we project that combined sales of these products will top $50 million this year.  
Please turn to Slide 7 and an overview of our recent acquisition. We are very pleased to welcome the team from Giant Factories to A. O. Smith. Giant is a Canada-based manufacturer of residential and commercial water heaters with a strong position in residential electric water heaters, a trailing 12-month sales of approximately USD 105 million. Giant fits squarely in our core North America water heater business and is consistent with our strategy to grow through acquisition and further penetrate existing markets. The transaction met several of our acquisition criteria, including expanding our presence and growing our core water heater business in the stable Canada market, leveraging our existing presence in Canada; adding to our sustainability efforts, given most of Giant water heaters are fueled by renewable energy sources; and the expectation that it will be accretive to EPS in 2022 with an ROIC in excess of our cost of the capital in 2023, ahead of our 3-year goal for acquisitions. We are excited to welcome our colleagues from Giant to the A. O. Smith team and look forward to continued excellent customer experience that they have come -- become known for.  
I'm now on Slide 8. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight some of our ongoing ESG and sustainability efforts. In China, we have reduced energy use in both our non-production activities and our production facilities. As outlined in our 2020 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report, we were honored to be awarded the rating of  ""Model Enterprise"" in 2020 by the Nanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone as an environmental protection pace setter. This distinction recognizes the depth of our environmental focus and operational processes to measure and reduce our environmental impact since 2016. As an industry leader, committed to innovation and investment in more environmentally sustainable and efficient technologies to heat and treat water, we published a white paper and analytical tool in September to help Federal, State and Local policymakers navigate the complexities of building decarbonization policies currently being designed and implemented around the country as part of a broader economy-wide effort to meet U.S. greenhouse gas reduction goals. An executive summary of the white paper is available in the Sustainability section of our website.  
I will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter."

Smith Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 9.

We delivered record third quarter sales of $915 million, up 20% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand and inflation-related pricing actions. These higher volumes led to third quarter net earnings of $132 million or $0.82 per share, which is a 25% increase compared with net earnings of $105 million or $0.65 per share in 2020.  
Please turn to Slide 10. Sales in the North America segment rose to $658 million, a 21% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. Pricing actions largely on water heaters represented approximately 80% of the increase. Higher volumes in water heaters and boilers were driven by strong replacement and new construction demand. The higher volumes of water treatment products added to segment growth also. North America segment earnings of $152 million increased 14% compared with the third quarter of 2020. The earnings benefit of inflation-related price increases and higher volumes was offset somewhat by higher material and freight costs. Pricing actions led rapidly rising steel costs, which resulted in a lower segment operating margin of 23.1% compared with the third quarter of 2020 segment market.  
Moving to Slide 11. Rest of the World segment sales of $263 million increased 19% year-over-year, approximately 60% of which was due to volume increases. Currency translation of China sales favorably impacted sales by approximately $14 million. Growth in each of our product categories in China contributed to local currency growth of 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by channel inventory changes, which remained at levels similar to the beginning of the year. Our products with higher selling prices, particularly our super-quiet gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products that deliver hot and ambient filtered water, contributed to sales gains. 
India sales grew 38% in the quarter as the economy begin to regain its footing after the COVID-19 delta variant wave subsided in that region. Rest of the World earnings of $27 million increased 60% from the third quarter of 2020. In China, higher volumes were partially offset by employee incentive costs and higher advertising as well as an absence of social insurance waivers, which were received in 2020. Segment operating margin improved to 10% compared with the third quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of improved operating leverage from higher volumes.  
Please turn to Slide 12. We generated strong free cash flow of $332 million during the first 9 months, 13% higher than during the same period in 2020, partially impacted by a larger investment in working capital to support demand levels. Free cash flow conversion was 95%, slightly below our historical performance of a 100%.  Our cash balance totaled $685 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $579 million. Our leverage ratio was 5.3% as measured by total debt to total capital at the end of September. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enables us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which is now $0.28 per share. This marks the 30th consecutive year of dividend increases and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return value to shareholders through sustained and increasing dividend. Year-to-date through September 30, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $212 million and have the ability to repurchase 5.4 million shares more on our current authorization. We took a pause in our measured stock repurchase pace in the third quarter as we enter the blackout period due to the acquisition of Giant. We plan to resume our repurchase program in early November, targeting $400 million for a total share repurchase in 2021.  
Let's now turn to Slide 13. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to target strategic acquisitions with a focus on water heating and water treating assets that we believe can return our cost of capital in 3 years. Giant is a great example. The purchase price of USD 192 million represents a multiple of approximately 9.5x projected 2023 adjusted EBITDA, and the acquisition returns our cost of capital in the second full year, this is inclusive of the present value of an expected tax benefit of approximately $6.5 million that will be realized by treating the transaction as a purchase of assets for tax purposes and projected operating synergies of approximately $5 million achieved over a 2-year period. We expect no impact to fourth quarter EPS due to customary purchase accounting adjustments and one-time transaction expenses. Purchase accounting headwinds are expected to run into the first quarter of 2022, as a result of Giant's conservative practice of carrying high levels of inventory, which are valued as of the acquisition date by marking the value to market. Giant's practice of carrying safety stock has served them well, especially during the current challenges within the supply chain and rapidly rising costs. We continue to finalize our purchase accounting and currently project the acquisition will add between $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2022.   
Please turn to Slide 14, at our updated full year 2021 outlook. We are now projecting full year sales to increase between 20% and 21% year-over-year. Based on this updated forecast and improved profitability, we are increasing our EPS range to between $2.86 and $2.90 per share. The mid-point of that range represents an increase of 5% compared with our previous guidance. We expect cash flow from operations for the year to be between $550 million and $575 million compared with $560 million in 2020. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million, and we expect to generate strong free cash flow of approximately $490 million with an over 100% conversion rate. We continue to experience inflation across our supply chain, particularly steel and logistics. Steel indices have increased 100% since the beginning of the year. We announced a fifth price increase on water heaters to be effective November 15 at a rate of up to 8.5%. These 2021 price increases are projected to have a cumulative effect on water heating prices of approximately 50% when fully effective in late December of this year. Based on that, we are raising the lower end of our North America segment margin guidance to between 22.75% and 23% and an improvement from our previous outlook. And Rest of the World segment margins to be approximately 8%, which is unchanged. Our updated outlook is based on key assumptions, including I've announced inflation-related price increases compounding to approximately 50% for water heaters as we exit 2021. Mid- to high single-digit inflation-related price increases in the remainder of our global portfolio. Strong demand in backlog in North America for all of our water heating product categories, driven by growth and replacement demand and new construction spending, along with the price increase announcements in our water heater and boiler end markets. No material changes -- and no material changes in the current macro environment. 
As for other housekeeping assumptions, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million, similar to 2020. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 22%. Important to note, our effective tax rate of 20.9% in the third quarter was lower than the prior year as it was favorably impacted by approximately $4 million or $0.03 per share, relating to amending previously filed tax return along with the change in our geographic earnings mix. Finally, we expect to end the year at outstanding diluted shares of 161 million. 
I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our top line growth outlook for 2021, which is on Slide 15. Kevin?"

China performance has shown consistency in the past 4 quarters. We are on track with our strategy to continue to expand distribution to smaller Tier 4, 5 and 6 cities in China. Consumer trends show increased demand for higher-priced products across all our categories, driven by differentiated new products that we have launched in the last 12 to 24 months. We expect year-over-year increase in local currency sale between 20% and 22% in China. We assume China  currency rates will remain at current levels, adding approximately $54 million and $4 million to sales and profits over the prior year, respectively. After currency impact, the majority of the projected sales growth is driven by a reduction in channel inventory levels in 2020. Power shortages in China have been sporadic. To date, we have had minimal disruptions to our operations, our managing through shortages by reducing energy use and nonproduction-related activities and supplementing power with generators on an as-need basis. 
Boilers sales grew 17% this year through September 2021. We are encouraged by the stability of our record backlog and expect 13% growth in boilers for the full year. We project 12% growth in full year sales for our North America water treatment products. This is slightly lower than our July outlook of 13.5% due to deceleration of growth in online and retail sales. However, we believe sales growth for our point to use and point of entry water treatment systems will continue to be driven by consumer demand for safe drinking water and reduce single-use plastic bottles. We estimate 2021 market growth of around 7%. 
Please turn to Slide 16. Thanks to the tremendous effort by our procurement and operation teams, our supply chain is stabilizing. Our manufacturing lead times remained consistent since mid-year. Through our focus and determination, we believe we will close out the year on a high note and continue strong into 2022. We remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

So when we look at our steel costs for Q4, sequentially, it will be up from Q3, will also be -- steel costs are about 2.5 to 3x more than what we were paying last year at that point in time in the fourth quarter. So it's a pretty significant ramp. So what we're seeing on the margin, I guess, headwind in Q4 in North America is just those costs hitting us faster than some of the price increases become effective."

I mean that's a 20-plus year investment for us, and we're building a strong brand, strong distribution, a terrific record for innovation. That strategy remains intact, and we'll continue to execute on that. As we mentioned in the past, we're continuing to invest in lower-tier cities. On the store fronts, we're continuing to monitor the productivity of our Tier 1, Tier 2 stores. We think we're there. We've adjusted maybe 100 to 150 and exited this last year. And then we're really building out our Tier 4 through 6 Tier cities. This year, we're up about 3,000 stores and want to qualify that a bit. It's not the same type of store as you would see in Tier 1, Tier 2, but they're mainly counters. But having 3,000 counters in a area that has grown and expanding is proving to be a very beneficial for our top line and long-term success in China. So it's overall, the commitment in China hasn't changed. Our investment in our brand continues, and we will continue to focus on innovation, our investment in R&D, again, continues to move forward. So again, some minor adjustments, moving into some other tier cities, making some adjustments in our current portfolio of stores. All on track. All we've been doing for the last 12 to 18 months. So strategically, we're still heading down the same path we have. I do want to come back to property development. 
And just to remind everybody, we really have no direct exposure in that particular segment. We could hit some, I would say, short-term headwinds as they work through some restructuring there, but also approximately 18 million new homes are required in China every year. That's quite an opportunity for us still regardless of what's happening in the property development market. So still a lot of opportunity in China regardless of some of the restructuring they'll have to do in their property sector."

So I wonder if maybe my first question, we could drill-in a little further on that. And just if there's any way to just talk about -- you mentioned the 50% cumulative pricing benefit in residential. What would be the comparable figure for the commercial business and pricing there? And I guess if there's any way to maybe elaborate a little on supply channel constraints, and how they might be different in terms of how the impact on the business versus what you're seeing in the residential product? But just talk a little bit about that commercial business would be helpful."

If we go back to maybe the supply chain, we're having similar challenges as any other company, and that's constantly changing. But what I'll tell you is what we're doing, and I think that's more important. We're certainly working closely with our suppliers. We're upping our safety stocks when we can, ready new suppliers, certifying alternatives, prepayment to ensure that we have a supply chain. So we're doing all the things we can with regards to making sure we have a consistent supply chain. So to answer to question directly, our view today, we don't see any major disruptions whether it's on a residential front or on our commercial part of the business or on our boilers. It will continue to move forward as we've had, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers to ensure that we can deliver our customers in any timely fashion."

We have taken some pricing actions, but to your point, the margin expansion of 100 basis points, we're going to be struggling to do that this year. We're right around 10%, though. So we're pleased with that performance on operating margin for this year. So we're continuing to set ourselves up in a good position for next year. We're working on all the same growth programs that we have in the past. We're looking for growth through all the channels, continue to look at cost reductions. And as we gain more base in that business, we're looking to leverage off of that base and continue to grow that expansion. So we haven't changed our outlook on year-over-year expansion of that, get a little bit of a headwind as we exit 2021, hopefully, in a better position for '22."

So again, when we look at this as more of a temporary headwind, short-term. We'll see how the property market kind of works its way out of where it's at today, and how the Chinese government gets involved. But I guess I'll comment that even within this, a consumer sentiment that's down a little bit, we have seen our consumers still pay up for premium products. And in the quarter, we had all 3 of our product -- core product categories have a spike trade up, and that's on water heaters, both tankless and electric as well as water treatment. So my view is, there is still opportunity regardless of how the market is performing at a point in time. But there is clearly a short-term headwind that we'll have to work through, and hopefully, the products that we have and how we bring new innovations to market will help us overcome most of those."

We, through this difficult time this year, have really improved our bottom line, cut our losses significantly. We'll talk more about those as we exit the year, but our margin profile has improved. And with volume -- again, this is a smaller business for us, volume does make a big difference as we have some nice operating leverage as we grow the business. So where we're at today and we're in our busiest part of the season right now, which is about 1/3 of our business in the next 3 months, we're executing well there. So very, very pleased with where we're at, very pleased where we think we're going to end up in -- at the end of the year, and we'll carry get forward as well.
