I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you. 2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International, marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environ",1121,"Thank you, Shep, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you. 
2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International, marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environment. In response to unprecedented conditions caused by COVID-19, we took decisive and swift actions to position the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond, and we delivered on all of our financial commitments for the year. I am proud of our achievements and particularly grateful for the efforts of our teams, including those on our front lines who helped us to achieve these milestones. 
First of all, we sustained the top line momentum we have achieved since launching our strategy in 2018, delivering another year of 3% plus organic net revenue growth. This led to record market share gains as consumers chose our products and made us clear winners in our largest categories of biscuits and chocolate. 
Despite COVID-19, we continued executing against our strategic growth agenda and increased investment across our business, in particular, in working media and capabilities like e-commerce. We added 2 very exciting bolt-on acquisitions, Give & Go and HU, which give us more exposure to fast-growing snacking adjacencies. Our continued investments were supported by an effective cost mitigation program that offset many of the COVID-19 related costs and helped simplify our business. 
In spite of the increased investment in cost, we were able to grow operating income faster than revenue and faster than 2019 through volume leverage and cost discipline. We also delivered on our commitment to generate strong cash flow and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders. 
Not only was 2020 a strong financial year, we also made progress in other areas like ESG, where we delivered on our 2020 ESG goals and set ambitious new targets. We also enhanced the commitments of our existing D&I agenda. And of course, we prioritized the safety of our colleagues throughout the year. 
Overall, I believe we are very well positioned to sustain growth now and into the future. We entered 2021 with good momentum, record share gains and as a more efficient organization as a result of our Emerge Stronger initiatives. As such, for 2021, we expect our results to be in line with our long-term financial targets. 
On Slide 5, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. I'll focus on the full year figures. Our organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. Not only did we show strong growth, we also beat the competition, thanks to the strength of our brands with consumers. Our adjusted gross profit grew 3.6% and adjusted operating income grew 4.6%, leading to an adjusted EPS growth of 6.5%. And as mentioned, free cash flow generation was strong at $3.1 billion versus $3 billion in 2019. This is a strong set of results, a clear demonstration of the strength of our organization and the success of our growth strategy even during severe external challenges. 
Turning to Slide 6. I would like to highlight several of the strategic actions we took to enable our business to emerge stronger from COVID-19. As the extent of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to mitigate incremental COVID-related costs and took the opportunity to significantly increase liquidity. We prioritized our capital expenditure behind projects with the highest return potential. We faced costs relating to lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, adaptations to our ways of working as well as the need for increased PPE. But we were able to offset the majority of these costs through savings across areas like overheads, trade spend and nonworking media. 
We also took the opportunity to simplify our operations, reducing the number of low turn SKUs we have in the portfolio, work that will continue into 2021. And finally, to maintain our top line momentum and brand strength, we invested more in working media while realizing material media efficiencies. Our swift reaction to COVID-19 was a real point of difference for us in 2020. Our teams were focused and agile in their response. We adjusted plans and accelerated some of our strategic initiatives, all of which set us up for success. 
Turning to Slide 7. We have remained focused on our sustainability commitments and our approach to governance. In May 2020, we held our first Snacking Made Right investor call, coinciding with the release of our Snacking Made Right report. We've also engaged with many investors, shareholders and stakeholders on ESG topics more than ever before. 
Looking across our ESG agenda, we focus on critical areas like minimizing our environmental impact, which involves using our resources like water and energy more efficiently as well as reducing waste and emissions. We also promote sustainable ingredients like wheat and cocoa, where we seek to build a more resilient supply chain. Generating a positive social impact is another priority, where we work to foster more inclusion and opportunity with local communities. 
Our key sustainability achievements for the year include meeting all of our 2020 CO2 emissions and waste reduction goals; continued work in collaboration on advancing a more sustainable future for plastics; continued investment in our Cocoa Life program, our $400 million commitment to sustainable cocoa, including efforts to prevent child labor; and increased traceability and forest monitoring commitments with our palm oil suppliers. 
And in terms of social impact as an organization, I am proud of our work in 2 areas. We established new multiyear global diversity and inclusion commitments, investing in global D&I leadership as well as plans and programs for our colleagues and communities in which we operate. We also donated nearly 30 million in COVID relief efforts around the world. This was a year where the potential was evident for a company like ours to make an even more positive impact on the world, and I'm glad that we made our contribution. 
Finally, Slide 8. Let me share a little more color on our recently announced acquisition of HU. We're excited to fully welcome them on board following our minority investment in 2019. This is a fast-growing, well-being snacking brand with a portfolio of on-trend products. HU's vegan, value-inspired chocolate, will be familiar to many in the United States. They are a leader in specialty and premium retailers already. In addition to chocolate products, they have recently expanded into crackers and have plans to enter other snacking adjacencies. Overall, the business is growing high double digits, and there's a clear opportunity to scale the business using our distribution and capabilities. HU is a great brand and a great fit in our portfolio, bringing us interesting opportunities in the key well-being/premium areas. 
With that, I will hand to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow. We delivered volume-led revenue growth for the year and the quarter of plus 3.7% and plus 3.2%, respe",1719,"Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow. We delivered volume-led revenue growth for the year and the quarter of plus 3.7% and plus 3.2%, respectively. Developed markets grew 4.5% for the year and 2.8% for the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and share gains. Emerging Markets increased 2.3% for the year, which includes a mid-single-digit decline experienced during the height of COVID disruptions. For the quarter, we posted growth of 4.1%. 
Some additional color on Q4. In developed markets, we continue to see elevated consumption for our biscuits category in North America, albeit growth has slowed down versus first half. In Europe, we delivered strong Q4 in both chocolate and biscuits, consistent with Q3. In Emerging Markets, we delivered good growth across the majority of our revenue base, including double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA Emerging Markets. 
A small group of markets continue to face economic challenges and headwinds related to high-end gum and candy exposure. This is predominantly in Latin America, which grew just over 1% in Q4. Overall, we continue to feel good about Emerging Markets and their future prospects. And in general, they have recovered quite well after the lockdown impact in Q2. 
Now on Slide 11 and portfolio performance. This is an important page as it shows how well the vast majority of our business is performing during the pandemic. The strength of biscuits and chocolate, meals and powder beverages shows that we have an advantaged portfolio with a good geographical footprint and that our execution resulting in meaningful share gains has amplified growth above category rates. Biscuits grew nearly 9% for the year and 7% for the quarter. North America was a big growth driver due to elevated demand and brand investment. Europe and EMEA also delivered strong Q4 results. Oreo was a clear standout worldwide, growing double digits, and many local jewels too posted high growth this year and increased penetration. Chocolate grew more than 3% for the year and 5% for the quarter. This includes nearly 2 points of headwinds from world travel retail in the full year and the negative impact of lockdowns in Q2 But overall, this is a great category to be in. And on top, our brands continue to perform very well, both in DMs and EMs and continue to gain share. 
Our overall growth rate is negatively impacted by gum and candy and continues to be challenged by reduced on-the-go consumption and mobility restrictions. While we did not see material improvement in Q4 versus Q3, we do expect gradual category improvement through 2021, but we are prudent in terms of those expectations. 
Now let's review our market and share performance on Slide 12. Through consistent execution, a significant step up in working media and portfolio of trusted global and local brands, we posted a great share results throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter. For the year, we held or gained share in 80% of our revenue base, up from 75% last year. Our largest categories delivered strongly as we held or gained share in 90% of our biscuits revenue base and 80% of our chocolate revenue base. Notable share gainers for the year included U.S., China and Russia biscuits; U.K., Russia and Australia chocolate; and China gum. 
Profitability performance was strong for the year and quarter, especially in light of approximately $250 million of COVID-related costs. Gross profit growth for the year and quarter was driven by strong volume leverage and cost mitigation programs. On the flip side, lower demand in world travel retail and gum resulted in unfavorable mix. Specifically for Q4, a lag between commodities and ForEx-related inflation and implementation of pricing weighed on DGP line. Overall, we feel good about our profitability and the substantial investments we have made in the business to sustain our growth momentum. including double-digit increases in working media to further support our brands and drive our category. 
Turning to regional performance on Slide 14. North America grew 8.6% for the full year and 4.5% in Q4, driven by elevated biscuit consumption and strong share gains. Share gains were supported by significant working media investment and strong DSD execution. Gum was down double digits. North America grew more than 19% for the year and nearly 15% during the quarter. Volume leverage, effective pricing, disciplined overhead management and waste reduction drove this performance despite significant COVID-related costs. 
Europe grew 2.5% for the year and 3% during the fourth quarter. Our Q4 results were driven by strength across our major markets, including the U.K., France, Germany and Russia, resulting in significant share gains. Strong execution and activations around the Christmas season helped us finish the year positively. We continue to grow our chocolate business, which was up mid-single digits for the year despite the 3-point world travel retail headwind. Biscuits and meals categories also turned in a strong performance. OI dollar growth was slightly negative for the year, driven by unfavorable mix and COVID cost. That said, trends have improved, and we posted nearly 6% OI growth in Q4. 
EMEA grew 1.7% for the year and [ 3% ] for the quarter, showing that we recover is sustaining across much of the region. India grew low single digit in the year after declining double digits in Q2 as a result of severe lockdowns. The country is performing well with double-digit growth in Q4 and the second half behind strong execution, share gains and investments. We continue to lead the growth of chocolate in India while expanding our biscuit platform. We are very pleased with the performance of this country. 
China grew high single digits for the year and quarter, driven by continuous share gains in both biscuits and gum. Strength in Australia chocolate, including share gains, helped drive solid growth in EMEA developed markets for the year. EMEA increased OI dollars by nearly 5% for the year due to strong leverage in the back half. This growth includes the impact of significant increases in A&C and route-to-market investment. 
Latin America grew slightly for the year and just over 1% for the quarter. Excluding Argentina, the region declined low single digits in Q4, given government holes where over 25% of the business before the pandemic, Latin America is the most impacted by lockdowns for both top and bottom line. Brazil posted low single-digit growth for the year and mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. Mexico declined high single digits for the year and low double digits for the quarter. WACAM declined low double digits for the year and the quarter, both due to the weakness of the garment candy market. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined [ 33% ] for the year and 66% for the quarter, primarily due to scale losses in the gum and candy category as well as timing of the commodities and ForEx pipeline versus pricing. As we expect some improvements in the gum and candy business as well as better pricing net of cost, profitability for the region should improve beginning in Q1. We have invested more in working media in Q4 and for the year despite profit pressure. 
Moving to EPS. Full year EPS grew 6.5%. This growth primarily reflected operating gains, mostly driven by strong revenue results. 
Now on Slide 19. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3.1 billion. We continue to put great focus on this area and feel very good about the progress we are making. 
Turning to Slide 20. We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders for the year This includes an 11% increase in our dividend rate and reinstating share repurchases in November after a temporary pause related to COVID volatility. We were also active in the debt capital market, refinancing more than $7 billion at attractive rates while significantly expanding our debt average maturity. 
Now let me provide some details around our 2021 outlook. At a high level, we expect a non algorithm year in terms of our financial outlook. We expect organic net revenue growth of 3% plus. This is predicated on the expectations that we retain our share gains and continue to invest behind working media and marketing and sales capabilities to support our brands and overcome some of the macro weaknesses we are experiencing in a number of our smaller markets. Biscuits and chocolate, from what we see today, should continue to do well in 2021. But we will be lapping some elevated growth in 2020, particularly in developed markets and for biscuits. 
On the flip side, there should be some recovery of the categories and countries mostly impacted by COVID. We have been prudent in our assumptions, mostly for gum, as we expect that category to recover more slowly. 
We usually do not provide quarterly guidance, but given Q1 last year was the strongest quarter, we do expect a slower growth rate in Q1 2021. Overall, for 2021, our plan is to deliver high-quality growth to beat category dynamics by continued to winning share. We expect EPS growth in the high single-digit range. This outlook implies continued growth of gross profit dollars, volume leverage and improved revenue growth management. These outlooks also reflect a step-up in commodity and transportation inflation as well as transactional ForEx headwinds in certain markets. Despite our expectation that COVID costs will subside in 2021 and our Emerge Stronger initiatives will deliver the majority of their benefits, we will reinvest the upside to sustain our share gains and to weather a more recessionary environment. For Q1, we will still face some headwinds in terms of mix impact on profit and price net of cost dynamics. That should improve throughout 2021 as pricing is coming in full effect. 
With respect to free cash flow, we expect to generate $3 billion plus. This outlook includes the deferred cash tax impact resulting from the participation in the primary offerings of JDE Peet's last year. Headwinds for [ COVID-related ] taxes is estimated to be approximately $400 million. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today, interest expenses of approximately [ $375 million ] and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion. 
With that, let's open the line for questions."

So the 3% plus for next year, the first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under",570,"Okay. All right. Thanks, Andrew. So the 3% plus for next year, the first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under the surface, there was a lot of puts and takes. And it looks like that environment, at least for the first half, will continue. So it's very early in the year. We will see what happens with the vaccines and the mobility of the consumer and the at-home consumption in Emerging Markets. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. 
We do feel confident enough to say that this will be a third consecutive year of delivering on algorithm And as you might remember, that is a significantly step-up from what it was before 2018. 
If I break it down, as Andrew asked, the tailwinds that we see is -- first  of all, the biscuits and chocolate categories are performing very well. And on top of that, we have broad-based significant share gains. So despite lapping that in 2020, we believe the categories will continue to perform well and that we will still continue to gain market share. 
The second tailwind I would mention is that we have very solid momentum going into '21. Our H2 growth rate was above 3%, and so we see that continuing. In H2, we also invested quite heavily. That would be the third tailwind for me, with a big step-up in the working media. We are going to continue to do that in 2021, so that should also give us a push. And then yes, we can't neglect that we will be lapping a weak year in gum and candy, in world travel retail in some of the smaller emerging markets. So we believe that, that will help us also. 
As it relates to headwinds that we will see, I would separate them in geographies, channels and categories. To start with the categories, for us, it's about the gum category and how fast that category will come back. It's largely based on mobility of the consumer. We haven't seen much movement in the second half of the year, so we are not assuming that there will be a big movement in the first half of next year -- or this year, sorry. So we want to plan prudently there. 
As it relates to channels, it's about world travel retail and on-the-go consumption. And for the time being, we've also assumed that in the first half of the year, that is not going to come back at a very high rate. And then geographies, we feel that the BRIC markets and other larger emerging markets are performing well, and we see them quite nicely coming back in Q4. But there are some smaller markets like Mexico, WACAM, North Africa, where we will likely be challenged for a while longer, largely because they have a big gum business. So 
I would say, at this stage, we feel comfortable with 3% plus We will see how the situation evolves. But we want to be -- we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and see how the first quarter comes along. 
The second question, I might hand over -- thank you, Andrew. The second question, I'm going to hand over to Luca about EPS and what we see there."

So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in o",395,"Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Dirk. So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in our algorithm, volume is, together with pricing, a critical component. We want to continue to be disciplined in our pricing approach, and we will leverage all elements of what we call revenue growth management to offset what is a relatively higher cost inflation than what we saw in 2020. I said quite a few times that inflation in 2021 will not be materially different than previous years, but it is moderately higher than what we saw before. 
And there are certain peaks around currencies, commodities. I mentioned a few times, cocoa grains are experiencing cost spikes and certain transportation costs and packaging. So we are good for most part of the exposure that is [ well covered. ] So I don't expect this situation to spiral out of control, but reality is there is a little bit of more cost pressure. 
On the other cost lines, we will continue to deliver productivities in line with what we have seen in the last couple of years. COVID cost will be more moderate. In 2021, we called out that there will be roughly 1/3 of what we incurred in 2020. And most of the Emerge Stronger benefits will carry through 2021. The degree of freedom, so to speak, Andrew, is an investment. And whether we deliver better profit, we will take that upside, and we expect to invest even on top of what we have at the current level into 2021 as we really want to sustain share gains and make strive into the strategic agenda that we have 
On tax and interest, I think we have been fair in terms of assumptions, and hopefully, they were clear. So I think high single-digit EPS is what we're going to get. I think importantly, on cash flow, just to round up the answer, we have to pay some taxes related to [ coffee ] transactions. And what we call a $3-plus billion is actually an underlying free cash flow that is round about $3.5 billion, so good numbers also there that clearly rely on profitability and continued working capital management."

And then a follow on what you're assuming about those moving parts into '21. Because in the end, what I'm really trying to understand is, I know you don't manage the gross margin, but it seems with the inflation that is building even as you catch up on pricing versus inflation dynamics in Latin America, as you mentioned, it seems like the gross margin being up in '21 could be ambitious. I'd love some color around that. And if you don't think you can improve gross margins, you're not planning on it, then I guess also curious as to what the sources of G&A efficiency might be in the coming year that will enable the EPS flow-through as well as the higher working media investments that you called out?"

So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectations",443,"Yes. So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectations. There is a big catch. And the catch is the fact that particularly gum candy suffered a decline that was around about 20%. That category is a category that is quite profitable. And stripping out 20% of the volume in 2020 resulted in a subscale type of category with under absorption on a few P&L lines. 
In that regard, what I would say is, if I take out COVID and gum  and  candy, I think the level of profitability is sound. We have a couple of things that we need to bear in mind. We were afraid that we would have a subdued Christmas season, which didn't happen. We had record high shares in Christmas, but we spent a little bit more in making sure that the stock was rotating. That's 1 impact. And the second thing is we haven't fully implemented pricing actions in quite a few places around the world. As we run out of coverage, particularly in Latin America, the exchange rate impact was quite material. And we priced ahead of running out of coverage, and we will price afterwards in an attempt to [ smooth  ] what consumer prices are. 
So in structural terms, I would say that there is nothing that is concerning me at this point about [ gross profit. ] I think you will see a P&L that makes sense in 2021. The level at which we will see gross profit in 2021 will obviously depend on the level of recovery of gum and candy, which happens to be something that we don't fully know of and we don't fully control. But in terms of structure, I think gross profit is sound. We have announced pricing actions around the world. We have visibility to the commodity pipeline for the vast majority of it. And ForEx, we are covered. We delivered, excluding COVID cost, sound productivities in 2020. We count on the same level in 2021. 
And by the way, when I look at the overhead line, excluding A&C, we did a terrific job in 2020 reducing overheads by almost [ 50 ] basis points. And we want to continue cost pressure and keeping the costs in control. So from my side at this point, I would say, I still overall good for 2021 GP. There might be a little bit of timing effect in Q1."

Thank you so much for the incremental color or all the detail you've given about the underpinning assumptions here to your guidance. Based on the conversations you've held with investors, I'm guessing the one area of debate -- the variants that are most hotly debated is your comment on sustained share gains next year. There's a lot of people who look at your market share performance this year and believe there's a degree of transitory benefit from the reality of you have a DSD organization versus North America DSD against others with warehouse, a lot of superior service levels. Maybe the scale of your supply chain also once again allowing superior service levels, and that -- those benefits naturally will unwind, and you're going to see share pressure in North America or Europe or somebody like DMs, where you gained so much. What do you think is -- where do you think that argument is fault or what are the risks? And what gives you confidence in your ability to sustain those share gains next year?"

I would say there's a number of arguments.

And so w",448,"Yes. I would say there's a number of arguments. The first one is, if you look at the share gains that we incurred in the second quarter of '20 and then you look at what happened in Q3 and Q4, our share gains didn't fade. They remain quite strong. And so we could already have expected that sort of effect that you're describing, Jason, in Q4 of this year. The largest categories that we are in continue to shine, and our performance in there is pretty good. It's not just our gains with our DSD system in the U.S. But we have 80% of our revenue base around the world where we are gaining and holding share, plus the share gain itself is quite substantial. The share gain in '20 was much higher than in 2019, where we also had a share gain. 
So if I look going forward, what are we going to do to make sure that, that effect doesn't happen, first of all, we have investments in -- that are substantially going to increase into '21. Our financial equation can afford it. You've talked a little bit about it that we constantly reinvest whatever we would overdeliver in our bottom line. And for the time being, we are planning to continue to do that in order to push our growth up. 
Second, we are having some very good channels effect, particularly in e-commerce. We are also preparing to move very fast in away from home, which will give us a boost, world travel retail and also convenience stores. So that will also give us an extra boost, and we will make sure that we move faster than anybody else there. 
Our customer service is good and it's very good. We had our supply chain performed really well, but there's still room for improvement because it was good in the times of COVID. It was not as good compared to normal time. So we think we will still have an upside from our customer service. And then we're doing a lot of work on RGM in order to protect our key price points and retain consumers. We've gained a lot of new consumers into our brands. We were quite curious to see what was going to happen again in Q3 and Q4, we were able to retain them, and we're counting to be able to do that again into next year. And then we have a very strong program, probably the strongest that I've seen since I'm here in innovation and also in activation. So because of all those reasons, I feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue our momentum in market share going forward."

And then second, just on category growth. Are you expecting an acceleration in category growth overall in 2021 relative to 2020? Obviously, there were some areas like gum or chocolate in travel retail that were down. significantly. There are other areas like biscuits that improved sequentially in 2020.

Well, I would say as it relates to organic sales growth and share gains, we are planning to continue share gains, but not through the magnitude that we've seen in 2020. We don't communicate on the magnitude. We just give you the countries where we've gained or increased our market share, but we expect that the share gain will be of a lesser magnitude. I can tell you that, and I think it's a reasonable assumption. 
As it relates to the category growth rates, in the measured channels, it was 3.1% for 2020, which was a slight decline versus 2019, where we saw 3.6%. And then, of course, you had the unmeasured channels, which were declining like away from home and world travel retail. So likely, if you would add those channels to it, you were probably looking at a total growth very, very minor growth. And most of our outperformance of the category was driven by our market share gains in 2020. 
I think in '21, what we are expecting at least is some reversion to the norm with the customers going back into the unmeasured channels from the message channels. And so as the restriction ease, so that will mean that the measure channel growth will slow next year, but that the combination of the 2 will remain about the same, maybe slightly less. And so we don't have to count on as much share gains to get to the growth that we're talking about. I hope that's helpful."

I think you see in the material that we called out that working media is growing 17%. We plan to keep the same level and increase it in 2021. So we are building on a continuous investment in working media, which importantly comes together with improved ROI, which means high-quality media we are putting behind our brands. We are investing more in digital, which in general terms, command a little bit more ROI than other regular channels. And third, again, the essence of diverting nonworking media into working media improves the overall spending ROI. So there is a compounded effect between increasing investment and having a better return on what we spend. 
And again, I think Dirk said it well. When we look at market and share, in Q4, we didn't slow down overall for the company. And what that means is that, yes, we had clear advantages in terms of supply chain at the beginning of the crisis. But as the situation normalized for us and for other competitors, people continue to favor our franchises to others. And I think one of the drivers is clearly the fact that we have invested more, that we have more meaningful innovation. And then we are activating effectively account of sales."

We are putting together -- and we have put together, actually quite good plans for the 3 acquisition platforms that we acquired in the last few years.

In Emerging Markets, again, I'm really happy about what I'm seeing. China grew nicely in Q4, almost double digit. It was just shy of double digits. India grew more than 10%, so is Russia. Brazil grew high single digits. So I'm positive about the evolution of developing markets overall. Clearly, there are some of them, particularly in Latin America, that are impacted by gum and candy. But again, as we start lapping Q2 numbers there, that should be better. I think as you step back and you look at 3.1% category growth in 2020, we have always said capital would grow [ 3% ] or so. I think you should expect the same type of [indiscernible] growth with all the puts and takes, clearly, biscuits being a little bit lower but gum and candy being much more positive.

On top of that, we are increasing our overall budget. And so we've increased the percentage of A&C of net revenue in '20, and we going to do the same in '21. The third driver of our increased ROI is a bigger switch to digital. So we are now well above 50% of our investment is in digital, and we know that we can drive a much better effect and a much better targeting of our consumers. 
And then the last effect I would say for our increase in ROI is the fact that we've done a lot of work on our brands, worked on purpose. We worked on communication. We've done a number of things that really have had a big effect, call it, Oreo, Cadbury, Milka. Really some big strides, for instance, to mention the Lady Gaga Oreo that's going to hit stores today. I think that's generating a lot of buzz, and we've done many of these things. 
There is some effect, but it's minor. Well, minor is maybe a big word. It is not the biggest driver on agency rationalization, if I can say it, and some margin negotiation. So there is some of that in there, but that is not -- certainly not the biggest driver of what we've done."

The peak -- the pickup of $0.10 in EPS due to translation clearly adds to the great progress we have made as a company, I believe, over the last 3 years. And it is fair to say that while the valuation has improved in the last 3 years, we still stand behind in terms of peer average and best-in-class. And so that gap, hopefully, over time, will close. When I consider the brands that we have, the geographic portfolio, the category exposure, our track record over the last 3 years, I would say that we are well positioned. And I would assume that over time, that should be reflected in our valuation. 
And the same conclusion, quite frankly, is if you do a sum of the parts. So I think we -- when I step back and I look at the quality of the EPS, the $0.10 of EPS that we think the current spot rate, I think there should be upside. But obviously, I leave to the market to decide.

I think to your question about are you offsetting all your costs? I think the #1 qualifier should be with or without COVID. And without cabin and the fact that COVID is subsiding, we will be fully offsetting the cost inflation over time as we enter the year. And as we get close to the end of 2021, I expect the run rate of gross profit to be at the same level as it would have been without COVID. 
So that has always been the intention. Over time, we want to be price disciplined. We will price away inflation, and we believe that is one of the building blocks of us being able to invest more in the company."

We are on track, and it's really part of a broader simplification program in order to drive both top line and bottom line. So it's reduction of SKUs, reduction of the number of innovation initiative. We're doing bigger innovation initiatives and then also a strategic review of our brands. We are aiming for 25% reduction in every region. There is no skew to 1 category or another. And so in the sense that what we have stopped manufacturing, so we don't make any more, we've already achieved a double-digit reduction in '20. I need to take into account, for instance, that in Europe, those changes can only be done in the first quarter of the new year. So they are going to do their SKU reductions right now. And we also have to do it at a certain rhythm because we are protecting our shelf space and trying to minimize waste. 
And so we will -- going forward, once we reach the level we were aiming for, the -- keep the lower SKU count, and we're going to apply a very strict 1 in, 1 out approach to new products. We -- important to mention is probably that we are not expecting any negative top line effect since these 25% only represent 2%, 3%. And keeping our shelf space, we should be fine. And going forward, there's a number of benefits as it relates to less complexity in manufacturing, for instance, better customer service, reduction of our inventories. And so we -- and also more sales we -- since we have more space for our top-selling SKUs. So it's going to support the delivery over long-term algorithm. It won't be transformative from a margin perspective, to our opinion, though. It will help, it will improve, but it's not that you will see massively improved gross margin."

You continue to call out the well-being sustainability is obviously a focus. And one could argue that kind of over time, even if your core brands continue to do well, there's still a lot of opportunity and distribution opportunity kind of more in that kind of well-being side. So just kind of maybe if you could just spend a little time just provide some color, kind of how you think about that internally? How do you leverage your capabilities, R&D, survey work, what have you, to kind of always make sure that you're on trend going forward with the brands you have but now also with the new brands? And then maybe if you could kind of tie in then how you would also be thinking about go-forward acquisition opportunities, kind of close to the core or still kind of maybe a little bit broader on the well-being side?"

It links in a little bit with that question about SKU. So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or buy brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow",584,"Okay. It links in a little bit with that question about SKU. So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or buy brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow to a certain level. So as you do that analysis, there is certainly an amount of health and wellness in that mix. But it certainly wouldn't be -- to be honest, at this stage, the majority of what we do. Every year, it's more, but we're trying to very carefully manage the balance between more indulgence and more health and wellness to -- over time in order to keep our mixed growth rate, if I can call it like that. Because what you have is that health and wellness is growing faster, but it's smaller. And so if you look at the mixed growth rate, we need to do both. And at the moment, we need to do a lot more of indulgence. 
As it relates to how we're thinking about it from an innovation, R&D and an acquisition perspective, clearly, we want to continue to increase our exposure to health and wellness. And particularly, if we think about the next 10 years, let's say, I do expect that, that mixture between indulgence and health and wellness will continue to balance more and more versus health and wellness. We will accompany that mix, and so we need to launch more and acquire more in that sense. 
The big areas that we are looking at internally with our R&D team and also externally is one is an example of Oreo gluten-free. It has to see with the ingredients, the nutritional composition, what can we improve? How can we gradually get products that the health-conscious consumers are more interested in. So it's sort of an upgrading of our current portfolio. And then we do have a number of products in market, very small tests with products we developed ourselves in-house, completely new breakthrough type of products, new brands. That will take time to develop, but we are also in there. And that goes much further than sort of cleaning up your ingredient or improving your ingredient panel. 
And then the -- we use mainly acquisitions to really take a big foothold in some of the big health and wellness space. So Perfect Bar is considered one of the healthiest bars in the market. Then HU is very particularly focused on the paleo vegan segment, and we will continue to do that in the U.S. and around the world. And those are sort of the big lines of what we are we're trying to do. There's a number of other areas that are going on. So for instance, portion control, we think, is part of health and wellness. So over time, we are trying to reduce the portions that we sell or that the consumer consumes. We talked about  the better-for-you credentials, but all natural is another one that is quite big. Local sourcing, in a way the consumer is considering as healthy? And then there's, of course, the functional benefits, energy bites and things like that. So what I would say the big groups of what we are focused on health and wellness were the ones that I was going through before. But yes, you will see a very balanced approach in gradually introducing more health and wellness products from our side."

I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you.2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International, marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environm",1118,"Thank you, Shep, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you.
2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International, marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environment. In response to unprecedented conditions caused by COVID-19, we took decisive and swift actions to position the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond, and we delivered on all of our financial commitments for the year. I am proud of our achievements and particularly grateful for the efforts of our teams, including those on our front lines who helped us to achieve these milestones.
First of all, we sustained the top line momentum we have achieved since launching our strategy in 2018, delivering another year of 3% plus organic net revenue growth. This led to record market share gains as consumers chose our products and made us clear winners in our largest categories of biscuits and chocolate.
Despite COVID-19, we continued executing against our strategic growth agenda and increased investment across our business, in particular, in working media and capabilities like e-commerce. We added 2 very exciting bolt-on acquisitions, Give & Go and Hu, which give us more exposure to fast-growing snacking adjacencies. Our continued investments were supported by an effective cost mitigation program that offset many of the COVID-19-related costs and helped simplify our business.
In spite of the increased investment in cost, we were able to grow operating income faster than revenue and faster than 2019 through volume leverage and cost discipline. We also delivered on our commitment to generate strong cash flow and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders.
Not only was 2020 a strong financial year, we also made progress in other areas like ESG, where we delivered on our 2020 ESG goals and set ambitious new targets. We also enhanced the commitments of our existing D&I agenda; and of course, we prioritized the safety of our colleagues throughout the year.
Overall, I believe we are very well positioned to sustain growth now and into the future. We entered 2021 with good momentum, record share gains and as a more efficient organization as a result of our Emerge Stronger initiatives. As such, for 2021, we expect our results to be in line with our long-term financial targets.
On Slide 5, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. I'll focus on the full year figures. Our organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. Not only did we show strong growth. We also beat the competition thanks to the strength of our brands with consumers. Our adjusted gross profit grew 3.6% and adjusted operating income grew 4.6%, leading to an adjusted EPS growth of 6.5%. And as mentioned, free cash flow generation was strong at $3.1 billion versus $3 billion in 2019. This is a strong set of results, a clear demonstration of the strength of our organization and the success of our growth strategy even during severe external challenges.
Turning to Slide 6. I would like to highlight several of the strategic actions we took to enable our business to emerge stronger from COVID-19. As the extent of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to mitigate incremental COVID-related costs and took the opportunity to significantly increase liquidity. We prioritized our capital expenditure behind projects with the highest return potential. We faced costs relating to lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, adaptations to our ways of working as well as the need for increased PPE. But we were able to offset the majority of these costs through savings across areas like overheads, trade spend and nonworking media.
We also took the opportunity to simplify our operations, reducing the number of low-turn SKUs we have in the portfolio, work that will continue into 2021. And finally, to maintain our top line momentum and brand strength, we invested more in working media while realizing material media efficiencies.
Our swift reaction to COVID-19 was a real point of difference for us in 2020. Our teams were focused and agile in their response. We adjusted plans and accelerated some of our strategic initiatives, all of which set us up for success.
Turning to Slide 7. We have remained focused on our sustainability commitments and our approach to governance. In May 2020, we held our first Snacking Made Right investor call, coinciding with the release of our Snacking Made Right report. We've also engaged with many investors, shareholders and stakeholders on ESG topics more than ever before.
Looking across our ESG agenda, we focus on critical areas like minimizing our environmental impact, which involves using our resources like water and energy more efficiently as well as reducing waste and emissions. We also promote sustainable ingredients like wheat and cocoa, where we seek to build a more resilient supply chain. Generating a positive social impact is another priority, where we work to foster more inclusion and opportunity with local communities.
Our key sustainability achievements for the year include meeting all of our 2020 CO2 emissions and waste reduction goals; continued work in collaboration on advancing a more sustainable future for plastics; continued investment in our Cocoa Life program, our $400 million commitment to sustainable cocoa, including efforts to prevent child labor; and increased traceability and forest monitoring commitments with our palm oil suppliers.
And in terms of social impact as an organization, I am proud of our work in 2 areas. We established new multiyear global diversity and inclusion commitments, investing in global D&I leadership as well as plans and programs for our colleagues and communities in which we operate. We also donated nearly 30 million in COVID relief efforts around the world. This was a year where the potential was evident for a company like ours to make an even more positive impact on the world, and I'm glad that we made our contribution.
Finally, Slide 8. Let me share a little more color on our recently announced acquisition of Hu. We're excited to fully welcome them onboard following our minority investment in 2019. This is a fast-growing, well-being snacking brand with a portfolio of on-trend products. Hu's vegan, paleo-inspired chocolate will be familiar to many in the United States. They are a leader in specialty and premium retailers already. In addition to chocolate products, they have recently expanded into crackers and have plans to enter other snacking adjacencies. Overall, the business is growing high double digits, and there's a clear opportunity to scale the business using our distribution and capabilities. Hu is a great brand and a great fit in our portfolio, bringing us interesting opportunities in the key well-being/premium areas.
With that, I will hand to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow.

Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow. We delivered volume-led revenue growth for the year and the quarter of plus 3.7% and plus 3.2%, respectively. Developed markets grew 4.5% for the year and 2.8% for the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and share gains. Emerging markets increased 2.3% for the year, which includes a mid-single-digit decline experienced during the height of COVID disruptions. For the quarter, we posted growth of 4.1%.
Some additional color on Q4. In developed markets, we continue to see elevated consumption for our biscuits category in North America, albeit growth has slowed down versus first half. In Europe, we delivered strong Q4 in both chocolate and biscuits, consistent with Q3. In emerging markets, we delivered good growth across the majority of our revenue base, including double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and mid-single-digit growth in AMEA emerging markets.
A small group of markets continue to face economic challenges and headwinds related to high-end gum and candy exposure. This is predominantly in Latin America, which grew just over 1% in Q4. Overall, we continue to feel good about Emerging Markets and their future prospects. And in general, they have recovered quite well after the lockdown impact in Q2.
Now on Slide 11 and portfolio performance. This is an important page as it shows how well the vast majority of our business is performing during the pandemic. The strength of biscuits and chocolate, meals and powder beverages shows that we have an advantaged portfolio with a good geographical footprint and that our execution resulting in meaningful share gains has amplified growth above category rates.
Biscuits grew nearly 9% for the year and 7% for the quarter. North America was a big growth driver due to elevated demand and brand investment. Europe and AMEA also delivered strong Q4 results. Oreo was a clear standout worldwide, growing double digits, and many local jewels, too, posted high growth this year and increased penetration. Chocolate grew more than 3% for the year and 5% for the quarter. This includes nearly 2 points of headwinds from world travel retail in the full year and the negative impact of lockdowns in Q2. But overall, this is a great category to be in; and on top, our brands continue to perform very well, both in DMs and EMs and continue to gain share.
Our overall growth rate is negatively impacted by gum and candy and continues to be challenged by reduced on-the-go consumption and mobility restrictions. While we did not see material improvement in Q4 versus Q3, we do expect gradual category improvement through 2021, but we are prudent in terms of those expectations.
Now let's review our market and share performance on Slide 12. Through consistent execution, a significant step-up in working media and portfolio of trusted global and local brands, we posted great share results throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter. For the year, we held or gained share in 80% of our revenue base, up from 75% last year. Our largest categories delivered strongly as we held or gained share in 90% of our biscuits revenue base and 80% of our chocolate revenue base. Notable share gainers for the year included U.S., China and Russia biscuits; U.K., Russia and Australia chocolate; and China gum.  
Profitability performance was strong for the year and quarter, especially in light of approximately $250 million of COVID-related costs. Gross profit growth for the year and quarter was driven by strong volume leverage and cost mitigation programs. On the flip side, lower demand in world travel retail and gum resulted in unfavorable mix. Specifically for Q4, a lag between commodities and ForEx-related inflation and implementation of pricing weighed on the GP line. Overall, we feel good about our profitability and the substantial investments we have made in the business to sustain our growth momentum. including double-digit increases in working media to further support our brands and drive our category.
Turning to regional performance on Slide 14. North America grew 8.6% for the full year and 4.5% in Q4 driven by elevated biscuit consumption and strong share gains. Share gains were supported by significant working media investments and strong DSD execution. Gum was down double digits. North America OI grew more than 19% for the year and nearly 15% during the quarter. Volume leverage, effective pricing, disciplined overhead management and waste reduction drove this performance despite significant COVID-related costs.
Europe grew 2.5% for the year and 3% during the fourth quarter. Our Q4 results were driven by strength across our major markets, including the U.K., France, Germany and Russia, resulting in significant share gains. Strong execution and activations around the Christmas season helped us finish the year positively. We continue to grow our chocolate business, which was up mid-single digits for the year despite the 3 point world travel retail headwind. Biscuits and meals categories also turned in a strong performance. OI dollar growth was slightly negative for the year driven by unfavorable mix and COVID cost. That said, trends have improved, and we posted nearly 6% OI growth in Q4.
AMEA grew 1.7% for the year and 3% for the quarter, showing that the recovery is sustaining across much of the region. India grew low single digit in the year after declining double digits in Q2 as a result of severe lockdowns. The country is performing well with double-digit growth in Q4 and the second half behind strong execution, share gains and investments. We continue to lead the growth of chocolate in India while expanding our biscuit platform. We are very pleased with the performance of this country.
China grew high single digits for the year and quarter driven by continuous share gains in both biscuits and gum. Strength in Australia chocolate, including share gains, helped drive solid growth in AMEA developed markets for the year. AMEA increased OI dollars by nearly 5% for the year due to strong leverage in the back half. This growth includes the impact of significant increases in A&C and route-to-market investment.  
Latin America grew slightly for the year and just over 1% for the quarter. Excluding Argentina, the region declined low single digits in Q4. Given gum and Halls were over 25% of the business before the pandemic, Latin America is the most impacted by lockdowns for both top and bottom line. Brazil posted low single-digit growth for the year and mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. Mexico declined high single digits for the year and low double digits for the quarter. WACAM declined low double digits for the year and the quarter, both due to the weakness of the gum and candy market. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined 33% for the year and 66% for the quarter, primarily due to scale losses in the gum and candy category as well as timing of the commodities and ForEx pipeline versus pricing. As we expect some improvements in the gum and candy business as well as better pricing net of costs, profitability for the region should improve beginning in Q1. We have invested more in working media in Q4 and for the year despite profit pressure.
Moving to EPS. Full year EPS grew 6.5%. This growth primarily reflects stable operating gains, mostly driven by strong revenue results.
Now on Slide 19. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3.1 billion. We continue to put great focus on this area and feel very good about the progress we are making.
Turning to Slide 20. We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders for the year This includes an 11% increase in our dividend rate and reinstating share repurchases in November after a temporary pause related to COVID volatility. We were also active in the debt capital market, refinancing more than $7 billion at attractive rates while significantly expanding our debt average maturity.
Now let me provide some details around our 2021 outlook. At a high level, we expect a non-algorithm year in terms of our financial outlook. We expect organic net revenue growth of 3% plus. This is predicated on the expectations that we retain our share gains and continue to invest behind working media and marketing and sales capabilities to support our brands and overcome some of the macro weaknesses we are experiencing in a number of our smaller markets. Biscuits and chocolate, from what we see today, should continue to do well in 2021. But we will be lapping some elevated growth in 2020, particularly in developed markets and for biscuits.
On the flip side, there should be some recovery of the categories and countries mostly impacted by COVID. We have been prudent in our assumptions, mostly for gum, as we expect that category to recover more slowly.
We usually do not provide quarterly guidance, but given Q1 last year was the strongest quarter, we do expect a slower growth rate in Q1 2021. Overall, for 2021, our plan is to deliver high-quality growth to beat category dynamics by continue to winning share.
We expect EPS growth in the high single-digit range. This outlook implies continued growth of gross profit dollars, volume leverage and improved revenue growth management. These outlooks also reflect a step-up in commodity and transportation inflation as well as transactional ForEx headwinds in certain markets. Despite our expectation that COVID costs will subside in 2021 and our Emerge Stronger initiatives will deliver the majority of their benefits, we will reinvest the upside to sustain our share gains and to weather a more recessionary environment. For Q1, we will still face some headwinds in terms of mix impact on profit and price net of cost dynamics. That should improve throughout 2021 as pricing is coming in full effect.
With respect to free cash flow, we expect to generate $3 billion plus. This outlook includes the deferred cash tax impact resulting from the participation in the primary offerings of JDE Peet's last year. Headwinds for coffee-related taxes is estimated to be approximately $400 million. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today, interest expenses of approximately $375 million and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
With that, let's open the line for questions."

While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under",573,"Okay. All right. Thanks, Andrew. So the 3% plus for next year, the first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under the surface, there was a lot of puts and takes. And it looks like that environment, at least for the first half, will continue. So it's very early in the year. We will see what happens with the vaccines and the mobility of the consumer and the at-home consumption in emerging markets. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do feel confident enough to say that this will be a third consecutive year of delivering on algorithm. And as you might remember, that is a significantly step-up from what it was before 2018.
If I break it down, as Andrew asked, the tailwinds that we see is -- first of all, the biscuits and chocolate categories are performing very well. And on top of that, we have broad-based significant share gains. So despite lapping that in 2020, we believe the categories will continue to perform well and that we will still continue to gain market share.
The second tailwind I would mention is that we have very solid momentum going into '21. Our H2 growth rate was above 3%, and so we see that continuing. In H2, we also invested quite heavily. That would be the third tailwind for me, with a big step-up in working media. We are going to continue to do that in 2021, so that should also give us a push. And then, yes, we can't neglect that we will be lapping a weak year in gum and candy, in world travel retail in some of the smaller emerging markets. So we believe that, that will help us also.
As it relates to headwinds that we will see, I would separate them in geographies, channels and categories. To start with the categories, for us, it's about the gum category and how fast that category will come back. It's largely based on mobility of the consumer. We haven't seen much movement in the second half of the year, so we are not assuming that there will be a big movement in the first half of next year -- or this year, sorry. So we want to plan prudently there.
As it relates to channels, it's about world travel retail and on-the-go consumption. And for the time being, we've also assumed that, in the first half of the year, that is not going to come back at a very high rate. And then geographies, we feel that the BRIC markets and other larger emerging markets are performing well, and we see them quite nicely coming back in Q4. But there are some smaller markets like Mexico, WACAM, North Africa, where we will likely be challenged for a while longer, largely because they have a big gum business. So I would say, at this stage, we feel comfortable with 3% plus. We will see how the situation evolves, but we want to be -- we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and see how the first quarter comes along.
The second question, I might hand over to -- I might -- thank you, Andrew. The second question, I'm going to hand over to Luca about EPS and what we see there."

So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in o",390,"Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Dirk. So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in our algorithm, volume is, together with pricing, a critical component. We want to continue to be disciplined in our pricing approach, and we will leverage all elements of what we call revenue growth management to offset what is a relatively higher cost inflation than what we saw in 2020. I said quite a few times that inflation in 2021 will not be materially different than previous years, but it is moderately higher than what we saw before.
And there are certain peaks around currencies, commodities. I mentioned a few times, cocoa grains are experiencing cost spikes and certain transportation costs and packaging. So we are good for most part of the exposure that is well covered. So I don't expect this situation to spiral out of control, but reality is there is a little bit of more cost pressure.
On the other cost lines, we will continue to deliver productivities in line with what we have seen in the last couple of years. COVID costs will be more moderate. In 2021, we called out that there will be roughly 1/3 of what we incurred in 2020. And most of the Emerge Stronger benefits will carry through 2021. The degree of freedom, so to speak, Andrew, is against investment. And whether we deliver better profit, we will take that upside, and we expect to invest even on top of what we have at the current level into 2021 as we really want to sustain share gains and make strides into the strategic agenda that we have.
On tax and interest, I think we have been fair in terms of assumptions, and hopefully, they were clear. So I think high single-digit EPS is what we're going to get. I think importantly, on cash flow, just to round up the answer, we have to pay some taxes related to coffee transactions. And what we call a $3-plus billion is actually an underlying free cash flow that is roundabout $3.5 billion, so good numbers also there that clearly rely on profitability and continued working capital management."

And then to follow on what you're assuming about those moving parts into '21 because, in the end, what I'm really trying to understand is I know you don't manage the gross margin, but it seems with the inflation that is building even as you catch up on pricing versus inflation dynamics in Latin America, as you mentioned, it seems like the gross margin being up in '21 could be ambitious. I'd love some color around that. And if you don't think you can improve gross margins, you're not planning on it, then I guess also curious as to what the sources of G&A efficiency might be in the coming year that will enable the EPS flow-through as well as the higher working media investments that you called out."

So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that, overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectation",437,"Yes. So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that, overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectations. There is a big catch, and the catch is the fact that particularly gum and candy suffered a decline that was around about 20%. That category is a category that is quite profitable, and stripping out 20% of the volume in 2020 resulted in a subscale type of category with under absorption on a few P&L lines.
In that regard, what I would say is, if I take out COVID and gum and candy, I think the level of profitability is sound. We have a couple of things that we need to bear in mind. We were afraid that we would have a subdued Christmas season, which didn't happen. We had record high shares in Christmas, but we spent a little bit more in making sure that the stock was rotating. That's one impact.
And the second thing is we haven't fully implemented pricing actions in quite a few places around the world. As we run out of coverage, particularly in Latin America, the exchange rate impact was quite material. And we priced ahead of running out of coverage, and we will price afterwards in an attempt to smooth what consumer prices are.
So in structural terms, I would say that there is nothing that is concerning me at this point about gross profit. I think you will see a P&L that makes sense in 2021. The level at which we will see gross profit in 2021 will obviously depend on the level of recovery of gum and candy, which happens to be something that we don't fully know of and we don't fully control.
But in terms of structure, I think gross profit is sound. We have announced pricing actions around the world. We have visibility to the commodity pipeline for the vast majority of it; and ForEx, we are covered. We delivered, excluding COVID costs, sound productivities in 2020. We count on the same level in 2021. And by the way, when I look at the overhead line, excluding A&C, we did a terrific job in 2020 reducing overheads by almost 50 basis points. And we want to continue cost pressure and keeping the costs in control. So from my side at this point, I would say still overall good for 2021 GP. There might be a little bit of timing effect in Q1."

Thank you so much for the incremental color or all the detail you've given about the underpinning assumptions here to the guidance. Based on the conversations you've had with investors, I'm guessing the one area of debate -- the variance, I mean, most hotly debated is your comment on sustained share gains next year. There's a lot of people who look at your market share performance this year and believe there's a degree of transitory benefit from the reality of you having a DSD organization versus -- a North America DSD against others with warehouse, a lot of superior service levels. Maybe the scale of your supply chain also once again allowing superior service levels and that those benefits naturally will unwind, and you're going to see share pressure in North America or Europe or somebody, like DMs, where you gained so much. What do you think is -- where do you think that argument is fault? So what are the risks? And what gives you confidence in your ability to sustain those share gains next year?"

I would say there's a number of arguments.

They remain quite strong, and so w",451,"Yes. I would say there's a number of arguments. The first one is, if you look at the share gains that we incurred in the second quarter of '20 and then you look at what happened in Q3 and Q4, our share gains didn't fade. They remain quite strong, and so we could already have expected that sort of effect that you're describing, Jason, in Q4 of this year.
The largest categories that we are in continue to shine, and our performance in there is pretty good. It's not just our gains with our DSD system in the U.S., but we have 80% of our revenue base around the world where we are gaining and holding share. Plus the share gain itself is quite substantial. The share gain in '20 was much, much higher than in 2019, where we also had a share gain.
So if I look going forward, what are we going to do to make sure that, that effect doesn't happen, first of all, we have investments in -- that are substantially going to increase into '21. Our financial equation can afford it. You've talked a little bit about it, that we constantly reinvest whatever we would over deliver in our bottom line. And for the time being, we are planning to continue to do that in order to push our growth up.
Second, we are having some very good channels effect, particularly in e-commerce. We are also preparing to move very fast in away from home, which will give us a boost, world travel retail and also convenience stores. So that will also give us an extra boost, and we will make sure that we move faster than anybody else there.
Our customer service is good, and it's very good. We had -- our supply chain performed really well, but there's still room for improvement because it was good in the times of COVID. It was not as good compared to normal time. So we think we will still have an upside from our customer service.
And then we're doing a lot of work on RGM in order to protect our key price points and retain consumers. We've gained a lot of new consumers into our brands. We were quite curious to see what was going to happen. Again, in Q3 and Q4, we were able to retain them, and we're counting to be able to do that again into next year. And then we have a very strong program, probably the strongest that I've seen since I'm here, in innovation and also in activation. So because of all those reasons, I feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue our momentum in market share going forward."

And then second, just on category growth. Are you expecting an acceleration in category growth overall in 2021 relative to 2020? Obviously, there were some areas like gum or chocolate in travel retail that were down significantly. There are other areas like biscuits that improved sequentially in 2020.

I can tell you that, and I think it's a reasonable assumption.
As it relates to the category growth rates, in the measured channels, it was 3.1% for 2020, which was a slight decline versus 2019, where we saw 3.6%. And then, of course, you had the unmeasured channels, which were declining like away from home and world travel retail. So likely, if you would add those channels to it, you were probably looking at a total growth, very, very minor growth. And most of our outperformance of the category was driven by our market share gains in 2020.
I think in '21, what we are expecting at least is some reversion to the norm with the customers going back into the unmeasured channels from the measured channels. And so as the restriction ease, so that the -- that will mean that the measured channel growth will slow next year but that the combination of the 2 will remain about the same, maybe slightly less. And so we don't have to count on as much share gains to get to the growth that we're talking about. I hope that's helpful."

We are investing more in digital, which, in general terms, command a little bit more ROI than other regular channels. And third, again, the essence of diverting nonworking media into working media improves the overall spending ROI; so there is a compounded effect between increasing investment and having a better return on what we spend. 
And again, I think Dirk said it well. When we look at market and share, in Q4, we didn't slow down overall for the company. And what that means is that, yes, we had clear advantages in terms of supply chain at the beginning of the crisis.

You know that Europe has world travel retail in it that got a material impact, so I expect Europe to grow. I think in the case of North America, obviously, we are lapping 13%, 11%, I believe, respectively, in Q1 and Q2, so that would be the toughest comparison. But then in the second part of the year, numbers are easier; and hopefully, as gum comes back, we will have a positive impact.
We are putting together, and we have put together actually, quite good plans for the 3 acquisition platforms that we acquired in the last few years. And so I think there is more to come in terms of North America and developed markets, but I wouldn't draw the conclusion that it is all bundled together because North America grew double digit in the first half.
In emerging markets, again, I'm really happy about what I'm seeing. China grew nicely in Q4, almost double digit. It was just shy of double digits. India grew more than 10%. So did Russia. Brazil grew high single digits. So I'm positive about the evolution of developing markets overall. Clearly, there are some of them, particularly in Latin America, that are impacted by gum and candy; but again, as we start lapping Q2 numbers, that should be better. I think as you step back and you look at 3.1% category growth in 2020, we have always said categories will grow 3% or so. I think you should expect the same type of category growth. With all the puts and takes, clearly, biscuits being a little bit lower but gum and candy being much more positive, you should expect a category growth in the neighborhood of 3% and on top of that, [ going ] to add shares."

What we've done is we have increased our working media, and the balance was, to my opinion, a little bit off. So the net effect in media has been significant, as Luca was commenting in last year, and we're continuing that effect in '21.
On top of that, we are increasing our overall budget. And so we've increased the percentage of A&C of net revenue in '20, and we're going to do the same in '21. The third driver of our increased ROI is a bigger switch to digital. So we are now well above 50% of our investment is in digital, and we know that we can drive a much better effect and much better targeting of our consumers. 
And then the last effect I would say for our increase in ROI is the fact that we've done a lot of work on our brands, worked on purpose. We worked on communication. We've done a number of things that really have had a big effect to, call it, Oreo, Cadbury, Milka; really some big strides, for instance, to mention, the Lady Gaga Oreo that's going to hit stores today. I think that's generating a lot of buzz, and we've done many of these things.
There is some effect, but it's minor -- no, minor is maybe a big word. It is not the biggest driver on agency rationalization, if I can say it, and some margin negotiation. So there is some of that in there, but that is not -- certainly not the biggest driver of what we've done."

Clearly, we leave to the stock market to determine the fair value of Mondelez, but let me provide some perspective. The peak -- the pickup of $0.10 in EPS due to translation clearly adds to the great progress we have made as a company, I believe, over the last 3 years. And it is fair to say that, while the valuation has improved in the last 3 years, we still stand behind in terms of peer average and best in class; and so that gap, hopefully, over time, will close. When I consider the brands that we have, the geographic portfolio, the category exposure, our track record over the last 3 years, I would say that we are well positioned, and I would assume that over time, that should be reflected in our valuation.
And the same conclusion, quite frankly, is if you do a sum of the parts. So I think we -- when I step back and I look at the quality of the EPS, the $0.10 of EPS that we're adding current spot rate, I think there should be upside, but obviously, I leave to the market to decide.
I think you had also a point about transaction ForEx, what we call transaction ForEx. And clearly, transaction ForEx is a benefit for all the businesses we have around the world.

I think to your question about are you offsetting all your costs, I think the #1 qualifier should be with or without COVID. And without COVID and the fact that COVID is subsiding, we will be fully offsetting the cost inflation over time as we enter the year. And as we get close to the end of 2021, I expect the run rate of gross profit to be at the same level as it would have been without COVID.
So that has always been the intention. Over time, we want to be price disciplined. We will price away inflation, and we believe that is one of the building blocks of us being able to invest more in the company."

We are on track, and it's really part of a broader simplification program in order to drive both top line and bottom line. So it's a reduction of SKUs, a reduction of the number of innovation initiative. We're doing bigger innovation initiatives and then also a strategic review of our brands. We are aiming for 25% reduction in every region. There is no skew to one category or another. And so in the sense that what we have stopped manufacturing, so we don't make any more, we've already achieved a double-digit reduction in '20. I need to take into account, for instance, that, in Europe, those changes can only be done in the first quarter of the new year, so they are going to do their SKU reductions right now. And we also have to do it at a certain rhythm because we are protecting our shelf space and trying to minimize waste.
And so we will -- going forward, once we reach the level we were aiming for, the -- keep the lower SKU count, and we're going to apply a very strict 1 in, 1 out approach to new products. We -- important to mention is probably that we are not expecting any negative top line effect since these 25% only represent 2%, 3%. And keeping our shelf space, we should be fine. And going forward, there's a number of benefits as it relates to less complexity in manufacturing, for instance, better customer service, reduction of our inventories. And so we -- and also more sales we -- since we have more space for our top-selling SKUs. So it's going to support the delivery over long-term algorithm. It won't be transformative from a margin perspective, to our opinion, though. It will help. It will improve, but it's not that you will see a massively improved gross margin."

You continue to call out that well-being sustainability is obviously a focus. And one could argue that kind of, over time, even if your core brands continue to do well, there's still a lot of opportunity and distribution opportunity kind of more in that kind of well-being side.
So just kind of maybe if you could just spend a little time, just provide some color kind of how you think about that internally. How do you leverage your capabilities, R&D, survey work, what have you, to kind of always make sure that you're on trend going forward with the brands you have but now also with the new brands?

So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or buy brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow to a certain level. So as you do that analysis, there is certainly an amount of health and wellness in that mix. But it certainly wouldn't be -- to be honest, at this stage, the majority of what we do.
Every year, it's more, but we're trying to very carefully manage the balance between more indulgence and more health and wellness to -- over time in order to keep our mixed growth rate, if I can call it like that, because what you have is that health and wellness is growing faster, but it's smaller. And so if you look at the mixed growth rate, we need to do both; and at the moment, we need to do a lot more of indulgence.
As it relates to how we're thinking about it from an innovation, R&D and acquisition perspective, clearly, we want to continue to increase our exposure to health and wellness. And particularly, if we think about the next 10 years, let's say, I do expect that, that mixture between indulgence and health and wellness will continue to balance more and more versus health and wellness. We will accompany that mix, and so we need to launch more and acquire more in that sense.
The big areas that we are looking at are internally with our R&D team and also externally is -- one is an example of Oreo gluten-free, has to see with the ingredients the nutritional composition. What can we improve? How can we gradually get products that the health conscious consumers are more interested in? So it's sort of an upgrading of our current portfolio.
And then we do have a number of products in market, very, very small tests with products we developed ourselves in-house, completely new breakthrough type of products, new brands. That will take time to develop, but we are also in there. And that goes much further than sort of cleaning up your ingredient or improving your ingredient panel.
And then the -- we use mainly acquisitions to really take a big foothold in some of the big health and wellness spaces. So Perfect Bar is considered one of the healthiest bars in the market. Then Hu is very particularly focused on the paleo, vegan segment, and we will continue to do that in the U.S. and around the world. And those are sort of the big lines of what we're trying to do. There's a number of other areas that are going on. So for instance, portion control, we think, is part of health and wellness. So over time, we are trying to reduce the portions that we sell or that the consumer consumes. We talked about the better-for-you credentials, but all natural is another one that is quite big. Local sourcing, in a way, the consumer is considering as healthy. And then there's, of course, the functional benefits, energy bites and things like that. So what I would say the big groups of what we're focused on health and wellness were the ones that I was going through before. But yes, you will see a very balanced approach in gradually introducing more health and wellness products from our side."

I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you.
2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International, marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environment. In response to unprecedented conditions caused by COVID-19, we took decisive and swift actions to position the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond, and we delivered on all of our financial commitments for the year. I am proud of our achievements and particularly grateful for the efforts of our teams, including those on our front lines who helped us to achieve these milestones.
First of all, we sustained the top line momentum we have achieved since launching our strategy in 2018, delivering another year of 3% plus organic net revenue growth. This led to record market share gains as consumers chose our products and made us clear winners in our largest categories of biscuits and chocolate.
Despite COVID-19, we continued executing against our strategic growth agenda and increased investment across our business, in particular, in working media and capabilities like e-commerce. We added 2 very exciting bolt-on acquisitions, Give & Go and Hu, which give us more exposure to fast-growing snacking adjacencies. Our continued investments were supported by an effective cost mitigation program that offset many of the COVID-19-related costs and helped simplify our business.
In spite of the increased investment in cost, we were able to grow operating income faster than revenue and faster than 2019 through volume leverage and cost discipline. We also delivered on our commitment to generate strong cash flow and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders.
Not only was 2020 a strong financial year, we also made progress in other areas like ESG, where we delivered on our 2020 ESG goals and set ambitious new targets. We also enhanced the commitments of our existing D&I agenda; and of course, we prioritized the safety of our colleagues throughout the year.
Overall, I believe we are very well positioned to sustain growth now and into the future. We entered 2021 with good momentum, record share gains and as a more efficient organization as a result of our Emerge Stronger initiatives. As such, for 2021, we expect our results to be in line with our long-term financial targets.
On Slide 5, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. I'll focus on the full year figures. Our organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. Not only did we show strong growth. We also beat the competition thanks to the strength of our brands with consumers. Our adjusted gross profit grew 3.6% and adjusted operating income grew 4.6%, leading to an adjusted EPS growth of 6.5%. And as mentioned, free cash flow generation was strong at $3.1 billion versus $3 billion in 2019. This is a strong set of results, a clear demonstration of the strength of our organization and the success of our growth strategy even during severe external challenges.
Turning to Slide 6. I would like to highlight several of the strategic actions we took to enable our business to emerge stronger from COVID-19. As the extent of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to mitigate incremental COVID-related costs and took the opportunity to significantly increase liquidity. We prioritized our capital expenditure behind projects with the highest return potential. We faced costs relating to lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, adaptations to our ways of working as well as the need for increased PPE. But we were able to offset the majority of these costs through savings across areas like overheads, trade spend and nonworking media.
We also took the opportunity to simplify our operations, reducing the number of low-turn SKUs we have in the portfolio, work that will continue into 2021. And finally, to maintain our top line momentum and brand strength, we invested more in working media while realizing material media efficiencies.
Our swift reaction to COVID-19 was a real point of difference for us in 2020. Our teams were focused and agile in their response. We adjusted plans and accelerated some of our strategic initiatives, all of which set us up for success.
Turning to Slide 7. We have remained focused on our sustainability commitments and our approach to governance. In May 2020, we held our first Snacking Made Right investor call, coinciding with the release of our Snacking Made Right report. We've also engaged with many investors, shareholders and stakeholders on ESG topics more than ever before.
Looking across our ESG agenda, we focus on critical areas like minimizing our environmental impact, which involves using our resources like water and energy more efficiently as well as reducing waste and emissions. We also promote sustainable ingredients like wheat and cocoa, where we seek to build a more resilient supply chain. Generating a positive social impact is another priority, where we work to foster more inclusion and opportunity with local communities.
Our key sustainability achievements for the year include meeting all of our 2020 CO2 emissions and waste reduction goals; continued work in collaboration on advancing a more sustainable future for plastics; continued investment in our Cocoa Life program, our $400 million commitment to sustainable cocoa, including efforts to prevent child labor; and increased traceability and forest monitoring commitments with our palm oil suppliers.
And in terms of social impact as an organization, I am proud of our work in 2 areas. We established new multiyear global diversity and inclusion commitments, investing in global D&I leadership as well as plans and programs for our colleagues and communities in which we operate. We also donated nearly 30 million in COVID relief efforts around the world. This was a year where the potential was evident for a company like ours to make an even more positive impact on the world, and I'm glad that we made our contribution.
Finally, Slide 8. Let me share a little more color on our recently announced acquisition of Hu. We're excited to fully welcome them onboard following our minority investment in 2019. This is a fast-growing, well-being snacking brand with a portfolio of on-trend products. Hu's vegan, paleo-inspired chocolate will be familiar to many in the United States. They are a leader in specialty and premium retailers already. In addition to chocolate products, they have recently expanded into crackers and have plans to enter other snacking adjacencies. Overall, the business is growing high double digits, and there's a clear opportunity to scale the business using our distribution and capabilities. Hu is a great brand and a great fit in our portfolio, bringing us interesting opportunities in the key well-being/premium areas.
With that, I will hand to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow.

Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow. We delivered volume-led revenue growth for the year and the quarter of plus 3.7% and plus 3.2%, respectively. Developed markets grew 4.5% for the year and 2.8% for the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and share gains. Emerging markets increased 2.3% for the year, which includes a mid-single-digit decline experienced during the height of COVID disruptions. For the quarter, we posted growth of 4.1%.
Some additional color on Q4. In developed markets, we continue to see elevated consumption for our biscuits category in North America, albeit growth has slowed down versus first half. In Europe, we delivered strong Q4 in both chocolate and biscuits, consistent with Q3. In emerging markets, we delivered good growth across the majority of our revenue base, including double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and mid-single-digit growth in AMEA emerging markets.
A small group of markets continue to face economic challenges and headwinds related to high-end gum and candy exposure. This is predominantly in Latin America, which grew just over 1% in Q4. Overall, we continue to feel good about Emerging Markets and their future prospects. And in general, they have recovered quite well after the lockdown impact in Q2.
Now on Slide 11 and portfolio performance. This is an important page as it shows how well the vast majority of our business is performing during the pandemic. The strength of biscuits and chocolate, meals and powder beverages shows that we have an advantaged portfolio with a good geographical footprint and that our execution resulting in meaningful share gains has amplified growth above category rates.
Biscuits grew nearly 9% for the year and 7% for the quarter. North America was a big growth driver due to elevated demand and brand investment. Europe and AMEA also delivered strong Q4 results. Oreo was a clear standout worldwide, growing double digits, and many local jewels, too, posted high growth this year and increased penetration. Chocolate grew more than 3% for the year and 5% for the quarter. This includes nearly 2 points of headwinds from world travel retail in the full year and the negative impact of lockdowns in Q2. But overall, this is a great category to be in; and on top, our brands continue to perform very well, both in DMs and EMs and continue to gain share.
Our overall growth rate is negatively impacted by gum and candy and continues to be challenged by reduced on-the-go consumption and mobility restrictions. While we did not see material improvement in Q4 versus Q3, we do expect gradual category improvement through 2021, but we are prudent in terms of those expectations.
Now let's review our market and share performance on Slide 12. Through consistent execution, a significant step-up in working media and portfolio of trusted global and local brands, we posted great share results throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter. For the year, we held or gained share in 80% of our revenue base, up from 75% last year. Our largest categories delivered strongly as we held or gained share in 90% of our biscuits revenue base and 80% of our chocolate revenue base. Notable share gainers for the year included U.S., China and Russia biscuits; U.K., Russia and Australia chocolate; and China gum.  
Profitability performance was strong for the year and quarter, especially in light of approximately $250 million of COVID-related costs. Gross profit growth for the year and quarter was driven by strong volume leverage and cost mitigation programs. On the flip side, lower demand in world travel retail and gum resulted in unfavorable mix. Specifically for Q4, a lag between commodities and ForEx-related inflation and implementation of pricing weighed on the GP line. Overall, we feel good about our profitability and the substantial investments we have made in the business to sustain our growth momentum. including double-digit increases in working media to further support our brands and drive our category.
Turning to regional performance on Slide 14. North America grew 8.6% for the full year and 4.5% in Q4 driven by elevated biscuit consumption and strong share gains. Share gains were supported by significant working media investments and strong DSD execution. Gum was down double digits. North America OI grew more than 19% for the year and nearly 15% during the quarter. Volume leverage, effective pricing, disciplined overhead management and waste reduction drove this performance despite significant COVID-related costs.
Europe grew 2.5% for the year and 3% during the fourth quarter. Our Q4 results were driven by strength across our major markets, including the U.K., France, Germany and Russia, resulting in significant share gains. Strong execution and activations around the Christmas season helped us finish the year positively. We continue to grow our chocolate business, which was up mid-single digits for the year despite the 3 point world travel retail headwind. Biscuits and meals categories also turned in a strong performance. OI dollar growth was slightly negative for the year driven by unfavorable mix and COVID cost. That said, trends have improved, and we posted nearly 6% OI growth in Q4.
AMEA grew 1.7% for the year and 3% for the quarter, showing that the recovery is sustaining across much of the region. India grew low single digit in the year after declining double digits in Q2 as a result of severe lockdowns. The country is performing well with double-digit growth in Q4 and the second half behind strong execution, share gains and investments. We continue to lead the growth of chocolate in India while expanding our biscuit platform. We are very pleased with the performance of this country.
China grew high single digits for the year and quarter driven by continuous share gains in both biscuits and gum. Strength in Australia chocolate, including share gains, helped drive solid growth in AMEA developed markets for the year. AMEA increased OI dollars by nearly 5% for the year due to strong leverage in the back half. This growth includes the impact of significant increases in A&C and route-to-market investment.  
Latin America grew slightly for the year and just over 1% for the quarter. Excluding Argentina, the region declined low single digits in Q4. Given gum and Halls were over 25% of the business before the pandemic, Latin America is the most impacted by lockdowns for both top and bottom line. Brazil posted low single-digit growth for the year and mid-single-digit growth for the quarter. Mexico declined high single digits for the year and low double digits for the quarter. WACAM declined low double digits for the year and the quarter, both due to the weakness of the gum and candy market. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined 33% for the year and 66% for the quarter, primarily due to scale losses in the gum and candy category as well as timing of the commodities and ForEx pipeline versus pricing. As we expect some improvements in the gum and candy business as well as better pricing net of costs, profitability for the region should improve beginning in Q1. We have invested more in working media in Q4 and for the year despite profit pressure.
Moving to EPS. Full year EPS grew 6.5%. This growth primarily reflects stable operating gains, mostly driven by strong revenue results.
Now on Slide 19. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3.1 billion. We continue to put great focus on this area and feel very good about the progress we are making.
Turning to Slide 20. We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders for the year This includes an 11% increase in our dividend rate and reinstating share repurchases in November after a temporary pause related to COVID volatility. We were also active in the debt capital market, refinancing more than $7 billion at attractive rates while significantly expanding our debt average maturity.
Now let me provide some details around our 2021 outlook. At a high level, we expect a non-algorithm year in terms of our financial outlook. We expect organic net revenue growth of 3% plus. This is predicated on the expectations that we retain our share gains and continue to invest behind working media and marketing and sales capabilities to support our brands and overcome some of the macro weaknesses we are experiencing in a number of our smaller markets. Biscuits and chocolate, from what we see today, should continue to do well in 2021. But we will be lapping some elevated growth in 2020, particularly in developed markets and for biscuits.
On the flip side, there should be some recovery of the categories and countries mostly impacted by COVID. We have been prudent in our assumptions, mostly for gum, as we expect that category to recover more slowly.
We usually do not provide quarterly guidance, but given Q1 last year was the strongest quarter, we do expect a slower growth rate in Q1 2021. Overall, for 2021, our plan is to deliver high-quality growth to beat category dynamics by continue to winning share.
We expect EPS growth in the high single-digit range. This outlook implies continued growth of gross profit dollars, volume leverage and improved revenue growth management. These outlooks also reflect a step-up in commodity and transportation inflation as well as transactional ForEx headwinds in certain markets. Despite our expectation that COVID costs will subside in 2021 and our Emerge Stronger initiatives will deliver the majority of their benefits, we will reinvest the upside to sustain our share gains and to weather a more recessionary environment. For Q1, we will still face some headwinds in terms of mix impact on profit and price net of cost dynamics. That should improve throughout 2021 as pricing is coming in full effect.
With respect to free cash flow, we expect to generate $3 billion plus. This outlook includes the deferred cash tax impact resulting from the participation in the primary offerings of JDE Peet's last year. Headwinds for coffee-related taxes is estimated to be approximately $400 million. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today, interest expenses of approximately $375 million and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.
With that, let's open the line for questions."

So the 3% plus for next year, the first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under",573,"Okay. All right. Thanks, Andrew. So the 3% plus for next year, the first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020, under the surface, there was a lot of puts and takes. And it looks like that environment, at least for the first half, will continue. So it's very early in the year. We will see what happens with the vaccines and the mobility of the consumer and the at-home consumption in emerging markets. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do feel confident enough to say that this will be a third consecutive year of delivering on algorithm. And as you might remember, that is a significantly step-up from what it was before 2018.
If I break it down, as Andrew asked, the tailwinds that we see is -- first of all, the biscuits and chocolate categories are performing very well. And on top of that, we have broad-based significant share gains. So despite lapping that in 2020, we believe the categories will continue to perform well and that we will still continue to gain market share.
The second tailwind I would mention is that we have very solid momentum going into '21. Our H2 growth rate was above 3%, and so we see that continuing. In H2, we also invested quite heavily. That would be the third tailwind for me, with a big step-up in working media. We are going to continue to do that in 2021, so that should also give us a push. And then, yes, we can't neglect that we will be lapping a weak year in gum and candy, in world travel retail in some of the smaller emerging markets. So we believe that, that will help us also.
As it relates to headwinds that we will see, I would separate them in geographies, channels and categories. To start with the categories, for us, it's about the gum category and how fast that category will come back. It's largely based on mobility of the consumer. We haven't seen much movement in the second half of the year, so we are not assuming that there will be a big movement in the first half of next year -- or this year, sorry. So we want to plan prudently there.
As it relates to channels, it's about world travel retail and on-the-go consumption. And for the time being, we've also assumed that, in the first half of the year, that is not going to come back at a very high rate. And then geographies, we feel that the BRIC markets and other larger emerging markets are performing well, and we see them quite nicely coming back in Q4. But there are some smaller markets like Mexico, WACAM, North Africa, where we will likely be challenged for a while longer, largely because they have a big gum business. So I would say, at this stage, we feel comfortable with 3% plus. We will see how the situation evolves, but we want to be -- we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and see how the first quarter comes along.
The second question, I might hand over to -- I might -- thank you, Andrew. The second question, I'm going to hand over to Luca about EPS and what we see there."
739693,701266125,2185098,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Dirk. So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in o",390,"Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Dirk. So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember that in our algorithm, volume is, together with pricing, a critical component. We want to continue to be disciplined in our pricing approach, and we will leverage all elements of what we call revenue growth management to offset what is a relatively higher cost inflation than what we saw in 2020. I said quite a few times that inflation in 2021 will not be materially different than previous years, but it is moderately higher than what we saw before.
And there are certain peaks around currencies, commodities. I mentioned a few times, cocoa grains are experiencing cost spikes and certain transportation costs and packaging. So we are good for most part of the exposure that is well covered. So I don't expect this situation to spiral out of control, but reality is there is a little bit of more cost pressure.
On the other cost lines, we will continue to deliver productivities in line with what we have seen in the last couple of years. COVID costs will be more moderate. In 2021, we called out that there will be roughly 1/3 of what we incurred in 2020. And most of the Emerge Stronger benefits will carry through 2021. The degree of freedom, so to speak, Andrew, is against investment. And whether we deliver better profit, we will take that upside, and we expect to invest even on top of what we have at the current level into 2021 as we really want to sustain share gains and make strides into the strategic agenda that we have.
On tax and interest, I think we have been fair in terms of assumptions, and hopefully, they were clear. So I think high single-digit EPS is what we're going to get. I think importantly, on cash flow, just to round up the answer, we have to pay some taxes related to coffee transactions. And what we call a $3-plus billion is actually an underlying free cash flow that is roundabout $3.5 billion, so good numbers also there that clearly rely on profitability and continued working capital management."

I'd love some color around that. And if you don't think you can improve gross margins, you're not planning on it, then I guess also curious as to what the sources of G&A efficiency might be in the coming year that will enable the EPS flow-through as well as the higher working media investments that you called out."

So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that, overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectation",437,"Yes. So clearly, in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that, overall, gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectations. There is a big catch, and the catch is the fact that particularly gum and candy suffered a decline that was around about 20%. That category is a category that is quite profitable, and stripping out 20% of the volume in 2020 resulted in a subscale type of category with under absorption on a few P&L lines.
In that regard, what I would say is, if I take out COVID and gum and candy, I think the level of profitability is sound. We have a couple of things that we need to bear in mind. We were afraid that we would have a subdued Christmas season, which didn't happen. We had record high shares in Christmas, but we spent a little bit more in making sure that the stock was rotating. That's one impact.
And the second thing is we haven't fully implemented pricing actions in quite a few places around the world. As we run out of coverage, particularly in Latin America, the exchange rate impact was quite material. And we priced ahead of running out of coverage, and we will price afterwards in an attempt to smooth what consumer prices are.
So in structural terms, I would say that there is nothing that is concerning me at this point about gross profit. I think you will see a P&L that makes sense in 2021. The level at which we will see gross profit in 2021 will obviously depend on the level of recovery of gum and candy, which happens to be something that we don't fully know of and we don't fully control.
But in terms of structure, I think gross profit is sound. We have announced pricing actions around the world. We have visibility to the commodity pipeline for the vast majority of it; and ForEx, we are covered. We delivered, excluding COVID costs, sound productivities in 2020. We count on the same level in 2021. And by the way, when I look at the overhead line, excluding A&C, we did a terrific job in 2020 reducing overheads by almost 50 basis points. And we want to continue cost pressure and keeping the costs in control. So from my side at this point, I would say still overall good for 2021 GP. There might be a little bit of timing effect in Q1."

There's a lot of people who look at your market share performance this year and believe there's a degree of transitory benefit from the reality of you having a DSD organization versus -- a North America DSD against others with warehouse, a lot of superior service levels. Maybe the scale of your supply chain also once again allowing superior service levels and that those benefits naturally will unwind, and you're going to see share pressure in North America or Europe or somebody, like DMs, where you gained so much. What do you think is -- where do you think that argument is fault? So what are the risks? And what gives you confidence in your ability to sustain those share gains next year?"

I would say there's a number of arguments. The first one is, if you look at the share gains that we incurred in the second quarter of '20 and then you look at what happened in Q3 and Q4, our share gains didn't fade. They remain quite strong, and so w",451,"Yes. I would say there's a number of arguments. The first one is, if you look at the share gains that we incurred in the second quarter of '20 and then you look at what happened in Q3 and Q4, our share gains didn't fade. They remain quite strong, and so we could already have expected that sort of effect that you're describing, Jason, in Q4 of this year.
The largest categories that we are in continue to shine, and our performance in there is pretty good. It's not just our gains with our DSD system in the U.S., but we have 80% of our revenue base around the world where we are gaining and holding share. Plus the share gain itself is quite substantial. The share gain in '20 was much, much higher than in 2019, where we also had a share gain.
So if I look going forward, what are we going to do to make sure that, that effect doesn't happen, first of all, we have investments in -- that are substantially going to increase into '21. Our financial equation can afford it. You've talked a little bit about it, that we constantly reinvest whatever we would over deliver in our bottom line. And for the time being, we are planning to continue to do that in order to push our growth up.
Second, we are having some very good channels effect, particularly in e-commerce. We are also preparing to move very fast in away from home, which will give us a boost, world travel retail and also convenience stores. So that will also give us an extra boost, and we will make sure that we move faster than anybody else there.
Our customer service is good, and it's very good. We had -- our supply chain performed really well, but there's still room for improvement because it was good in the times of COVID. It was not as good compared to normal time. So we think we will still have an upside from our customer service.
And then we're doing a lot of work on RGM in order to protect our key price points and retain consumers. We've gained a lot of new consumers into our brands. We were quite curious to see what was going to happen. Again, in Q3 and Q4, we were able to retain them, and we're counting to be able to do that again into next year. And then we have a very strong program, probably the strongest that I've seen since I'm here, in innovation and also in activation. So because of all those reasons, I feel pretty good about our opportunity to continue our momentum in market share going forward."

And then second, just on category growth. Are you expecting an acceleration in category growth overall in 2021 relative to 2020? Obviously, there were some areas like gum or chocolate in travel retail that were down significantly. There are other areas like biscuits that improved sequentially in 2020. So just sort of curious for overall category growth how are you thinking about that growth in 2021 relative to 2020 and if you see any acceleration there overall."

Well, I would say as it relates to organic sales growth and share gains, we are planning to continue share gains, but not to the magnitude that we've seen in 2020. We don't communicate on the magnitude. We just give you the countries where we've gained or increased our market share, but we expect that the share gain will be of a lesser magnitude. I can tell you that, and I think it's a reasonable assumption.
As it relates to the category growth rates, in the measured channels, it was 3.1% for 2020, which was a slight decline versus 2019, where we saw 3.6%. And then, of course, you had the unmeasured channels, which were declining like away from home and world travel retail. So likely, if you would add those channels to it, you were probably looking at a total growth, very, very minor growth. And most of our outperformance of the category was driven by our market share gains in 2020.
I think in '21, what we are expecting at least is some reversion to the norm with the customers going back into the unmeasured channels from the measured channels. And so as the restriction ease, so that the -- that will mean that the measured channel growth will slow next year but that the combination of the 2 will remain about the same, maybe slightly less. And so we don't have to count on as much share gains to get to the growth that we're talking about. I hope that's helpful."

I think you see in the material that we called out that working media is growing 17%. We plan to keep the same level and increase it in 2021. So we are building on a continuous investment in working media, which importantly comes together with improved ROI, which means high-quality media we are putting behind our brands. We are investing more in digital, which, in general terms, command a little bit more ROI than other regular channels. And third, again, the essence of diverting nonworking media into working media improves the overall spending ROI; so there is a compounded effect between increasing investment and having a better return on what we spend. 
And again, I think Dirk said it well. When we look at market and share, in Q4, we didn't slow down overall for the company. And what that means is that, yes, we had clear advantages in terms of supply chain at the beginning of the crisis. But as the situation normalized for us and for other competitors, people continue to favor our franchises to others. And I think one of the drivers is clearly the fact that we have invested more, that we have more meaningful innovation. And then we are activating effectively account of sales."

You know that Europe has world travel retail in it that got a material impact, so I expect Europe to grow.

But then in the second part of the year, numbers are easier; and hopefully, as gum comes back, we will have a positive impact.
We are putting together, and we have put together actually, quite good plans for the 3 acquisition platforms that we acquired in the last few years. And so I think there is more to come in terms of North America and developed markets, but I wouldn't draw the conclusion that it is all bundled together because North America grew double digit in the first half.
In emerging markets, again, I'm really happy about what I'm seeing. China grew nicely in Q4, almost double digit. It was just shy of double digits. India grew more than 10%. So did Russia. Brazil grew high single digits. So I'm positive about the evolution of developing markets overall. Clearly, there are some of them, particularly in Latin America, that are impacted by gum and candy; but again, as we start lapping Q2 numbers, that should be better. I think as you step back and you look at 3.1% category growth in 2020, we have always said categories will grow 3% or so. I think you should expect the same type of category growth. With all the puts and takes, clearly, biscuits being a little bit lower but gum and candy being much more positive, you should expect a category growth in the neighborhood of 3% and on top of that, [ going ] to add shares."

What we've done is we have increased our working media, and the balance was, to my opinion, a little bit off. So the net effect in media has been significant, as Luca was commenting in last year, and we're continuing that effect in '21.
On top of that, we are increasing our overall budget. And so we've increased the percentage of A&C of net revenue in '20, and we're going to do the same in '21. The third driver of our increased ROI is a bigger switch to digital. So we are now well above 50% of our investment is in digital, and we know that we can drive a much better effect and much better targeting of our consumers. 
And then the last effect I would say for our increase in ROI is the fact that we've done a lot of work on our brands, worked on purpose. We worked on communication. We've done a number of things that really have had a big effect to, call it, Oreo, Cadbury, Milka; really some big strides, for instance, to mention, the Lady Gaga Oreo that's going to hit stores today. I think that's generating a lot of buzz, and we've done many of these things.
There is some effect, but it's minor -- no, minor is maybe a big word. It is not the biggest driver on agency rationalization, if I can say it, and some margin negotiation. So there is some of that in there, but that is not -- certainly not the biggest driver of what we've done."

The peak -- the pickup of $0.10 in EPS due to translation clearly adds to the great progress we have made as a company, I believe, over the last 3 years. And it is fair to say that, while the valuation has improved in the last 3 years, we still stand behind in terms of peer average and best in class; and so that gap, hopefully, over time, will close. When I consider the brands that we have, the geographic portfolio, the category exposure, our track record over the last 3 years, I would say that we are well positioned, and I would assume that over time, that should be reflected in our valuation.
And the same conclusion, quite frankly, is if you do a sum of the parts. So I think we -- when I step back and I look at the quality of the EPS, the $0.10 of EPS that we're adding current spot rate, I think there should be upside, but obviously, I leave to the market to decide.
I think you had also a point about transaction ForEx, what we call transaction ForEx. And clearly, transaction ForEx is a benefit for all the businesses we have around the world.

We are on track, and it's really part of a broader simplification program in order to drive both top line and bottom line. So it's a reduction of SKUs, a reduction of the number of innovation initiative. We're doing bigger innovation initiatives and then also a strategic review of our brands. We are aiming for 25% reduction in every region. There is no skew to one category or another. And so in the sense that what we have stopped manufacturing, so we don't make any more, we've already achieved a double-digit reduction in '20. I need to take into account, for instance, that, in Europe, those changes can only be done in the first quarter of the new year, so they are going to do their SKU reductions right now. And we also have to do it at a certain rhythm because we are protecting our shelf space and trying to minimize waste.
And so we will -- going forward, once we reach the level we were aiming for, the -- keep the lower SKU count, and we're going to apply a very strict 1 in, 1 out approach to new products. We -- important to mention is probably that we are not expecting any negative top line effect since these 25% only represent 2%, 3%. And keeping our shelf space, we should be fine. And going forward, there's a number of benefits as it relates to less complexity in manufacturing, for instance, better customer service, reduction of our inventories. And so we -- and also more sales we -- since we have more space for our top-selling SKUs. So it's going to support the delivery over long-term algorithm. It won't be transformative from a margin perspective, to our opinion, though. It will help. It will improve, but it's not that you will see a massively improved gross margin."

So just kind of maybe if you could just spend a little time, just provide some color kind of how you think about that internally. How do you leverage your capabilities, R&D, survey work, what have you, to kind of always make sure that you're on trend going forward with the brands you have but now also with the new brands?

So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or buy brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow",583,"Okay. It links in a little bit with that question about SKU. So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or buy brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow to a certain level. So as you do that analysis, there is certainly an amount of health and wellness in that mix. But it certainly wouldn't be -- to be honest, at this stage, the majority of what we do.
Every year, it's more, but we're trying to very carefully manage the balance between more indulgence and more health and wellness to -- over time in order to keep our mixed growth rate, if I can call it like that, because what you have is that health and wellness is growing faster, but it's smaller. And so if you look at the mixed growth rate, we need to do both; and at the moment, we need to do a lot more of indulgence.
As it relates to how we're thinking about it from an innovation, R&D and acquisition perspective, clearly, we want to continue to increase our exposure to health and wellness. And particularly, if we think about the next 10 years, let's say, I do expect that, that mixture between indulgence and health and wellness will continue to balance more and more versus health and wellness. We will accompany that mix, and so we need to launch more and acquire more in that sense.
The big areas that we are looking at are internally with our R&D team and also externally is -- one is an example of Oreo gluten-free, has to see with the ingredients the nutritional composition. What can we improve? How can we gradually get products that the health conscious consumers are more interested in? So it's sort of an upgrading of our current portfolio.
And then we do have a number of products in market, very, very small tests with products we developed ourselves in-house, completely new breakthrough type of products, new brands. That will take time to develop, but we are also in there. And that goes much further than sort of cleaning up your ingredient or improving your ingredient panel.
And then the -- we use mainly acquisitions to really take a big foothold in some of the big health and wellness spaces. So Perfect Bar is considered one of the healthiest bars in the market. Then Hu is very particularly focused on the paleo, vegan segment, and we will continue to do that in the U.S. and around the world. And those are sort of the big lines of what we're trying to do. There's a number of other areas that are going on. So for instance, portion control, we think, is part of health and wellness. So over time, we are trying to reduce the portions that we sell or that the consumer consumes. We talked about the better-for-you credentials, but all natural is another one that is quite big. Local sourcing, in a way, the consumer is considering as healthy. And then there's, of course, the functional benefits, energy bites and things like that. So what I would say the big groups of what we're focused on health and wellness were the ones that I was going through before. But yes, you will see a very balanced approach in gradually introducing more health and wellness products from our side."

We had a strong start to the year despite lapping our highest growth quarter in 2020 and Q1 reconfirms that we are emerging from COVID even stronger. Our performance demonstrates that our strategy is working and that we have clear growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving a virtuous cycle and producing a consistent track record of growth.
As we continue to deliver on our commitments, we are also strengthening our business by accelerating investments, reshaping our portfolio and simplifying the business while maintaining cost discipline. We are well positioned to accelerate long-term revenue and earnings growth.
On Slide 5, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. Top line growth was 3.8%, underpinned by broad-based share gains and excellent execution across all geographies, categories and brands. Our teams around the world delivered amazing results with events like Chinese New Year and Easter being clear standouts. In turn, the strong volume and price-driven top line translated into gross profit dollar growth of 5%, also aided by our emerged stronger cost initiatives.
We continue to invest in our brands and sales and marketing capabilities to drive our categories. We also increased working media double digits to support further share gains. And a good business converts top line results into cash. And for the quarter, we generated $700 million, which is the best first quarter since the formation of the company, which continues to enable us for strong capital return to our investors.
In summary, our first quarter results leave us well positioned to deliver on our full year 2021 outlook and provide increased confidence that we can accelerate our long-term growth rate.
On Slide 6, let me spend a moment on our track record, which we expect to continue. Q1 top line results marked another quarter at or above our long-term growth algorithm of 3% plus, now averaging 3.8% growth since late 2018. This is happening because we have fundamentally changed our approach to the business. From a focus on costs and profit margins, we have switched to top line growth and profit dollars, which has driven better and more consistent results.
Our local first commercial approach enables us to move faster and be more consumer-centric. We have entered a virtuous financial algorithm, which allows us to invest more in the business. And lastly, our incentives are better aligned with an ownership and growth mindset with increased accountability and high-quality outcomes.
Beyond Q1 results and 2021 expected outcomes, as shown on Slide 7, we believe we are uniquely well positioned to thrive in the years ahead with a long runway of growth opportunities and advantaged growth enablers. First, our core categories are attractive and resilient, demonstrating durable growth and significant headroom for future upside. Second, We believe our growth algorithm and our ability to continue to invest behind strong growth propositions is something that sets us apart from our competition and will continue to result in share gains over the years ahead. Third, we are seizing large opportunities in under-indexed channels like e-commerce and discounters. Fourth, we have significant opportunities to expand in high-growth segments like well-being and premium and in geographies where we have a strong share of 1 core category but a much lower share of another. And beyond our core categories, we are building strong platforms in high-growth adjacencies such as cakes and pastries or bars.
We believe we have distinct advantages that will enable us to seize these opportunities. These include our proven ability to price across the globe, more impactful and high-return marketing, increased investments in our brands, ongoing portfolio reshaping to increase our exposure to incremental high-growth areas of snacking, continued cost improvements to fuel investments and increased business clarity and simplification.
On Slide 8, you can see the strong progress we have made in Q1 against some of our biggest growth opportunities. Within our core business, we achieved double-digit growth in category Dairy Milk and high single growth in Oreo. Oreo has been growing at a double-digit CAGR since 2018 as we activate our planned trade group and pursue a $1 billion opportunity over the next 3 years via geographical expansion and share gains. We also delivered mid-single-digit growth in our local jewels including strong results from Chips Ahoy and dates and biscuit as well as Cott and Lata in chocolate. Continued efforts to revitalize brand messaging, packaging and activations have created a growth engine within a substantial part of our portfolio.
Looking at our channel opportunities, the consumer shift to e-commerce continues to accelerate growing 77% on a reported basis in the first quarter with share gains in the U.S., China and the U.K. E-commerce represented approximately 6% of our revenue in Q1. This has not come at the expense of brick-and-mortar, where we continue to drive distribution gains in key emerging markets like China, where we added 120,000 stores in the last quarter or in India where we added 60,000. To put that China figure in context, in China biscuits, we are now in 3 million stores out of 6 million that formed the Nielsen universe. So we have a huge headroom. And in gum, we are only in 1.9 million of 6 million stores, and our leading competitor is in 4.2 million stores.
As it relates to the opportunity in high-growth segments, we significantly increased our presence in well-being and premium this quarter with the acquisitions of Grenade, Gourmet Food and Hu. And finally, we continue to expand in close in adjacencies, becoming the lead manufacturer in the U.K. snack bars category with Grenade.
Since the launch of our strategy, we have enhanced our portfolio by adding nearly $1 billion in revenue with a number of high-growth platforms, as you can see on Slide 9. These acquisitions are driving accelerated growth and have a long runway. Our balance sheet provides a great flexibility and optionality, particularly through our coffee JVs. While we are very happy with the results and prospects of both KDP and JDE, our expectation is to increase our exposure to snacking over time. And in 2020, we sold down our stakes in both with $2 billion of net proceeds to convert into a highly strategic snacking acquisitions.
We are also evaluating our developed market gum business to determine the best way forward. Across these initiatives, we are driving clear outcomes in the form of accelerated growth.
Next, I will share some additional color on these recent acquisitions and how they'll align with our strategy on Slide 10. Our focus has always been to increase our exposure to high-growth segments like premium and well-being, enter geographic wide spaces in our core categories or expand into fast-growing adjacencies.
Most recently, we acquired 4 fast-growing companies. Grenade, the U.K. energy protein bar, the leader that is allowing us to expand our snacking portfolio into active nutrition products. It was a missing piece to become the largest players in the $1.2 billion U.K. snack bar market.
Gourmet Foods, which is a premium and well-being focused cracker portfolio in Australia. This platform allows us to significantly increase our Australia biscuits business and share. The brand has tremendous growth potential inside and outside of Australia and is a leader in a highly attractive segment.
Hu is a premium well-being chocolate-led lifestyle brand that has developed a very strong followership. It is the fastest moving chocolate brand in Whole Foods but currently has limited presence in more conventional retailers, which is a clear opportunity.
And Give & Go is an undisputed leader in the large and high-growth in-store bakery segment in North America. It is highly incremental and spans across multiple product forms like cookies, muffins, brownies and cupcakes. It has strong consumer appeal, driven by high-quality freshness and permissible indulgence. This platform is performing very well, and we believe it will yield good revenue and cost synergies.
As we have seen with our prior acquisitions of Tate's and Perfect Snacks, these platforms provide leadership positions in new or adjacent categories of increasing relevance with our consumers. They represent large addressable markets are financially attractive and create new growth path for us.
Turning to Slide 11 and our sustainability commitments and approach. We believe we can create value by building a sustainable snacking company that is focused on sustainability -- or sorry, sustainably sourced ingredients, minimizing our climate and landscape impact, building a diverse, inclusive and engaged workforce, selling products that meet the evolving snacking needs of consumers and result in zero packaging waste. We are confident that our approach is effective as we prioritize according to where we have the largest impact. We focus on breakthrough solutions, and we collaborate when needed.
In closing, our strong start to the year gives us increasing conviction that the steps we are taking to evolve our growth strategies are the right ones and that they will continue to support consistent and profitable growth for many years to come.
With that, I will hand to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Our first quarter performance was strong across all key financial metrics, building off the strength and momentum of 2020.
Revenue grew 3.8% driven by broad-based growth and a healthy balance of price and volume. On a 2-year average basis, we grew for 5.1%. Emerging market performance was strong with growth of 10% for the quarter and more than 7% on a 2-year basis.
Quarter 1 marks for emerging markets, a solid come back from the impact of COVID and proves that our geographical footprint is a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. These results include double-digit growth in Brazil, India and China as well as high single-digit increase in Russia.
In developed markets, we continue to see solid consumption and are pleased with our performance, given the elevated demand in the previous year quarter. These markets were in positive growth territory for the quarter, while the 2-year average growth for was 4%.
Turning to Slide 14 and performance by category. Biscuits grew plus 3.4% in Q1 and plus 7.6% on a 2-year average. Each of our big countries delivered double-digit growth during the quarter, while our large U.S. business posted low single-digit growth against very elevated growth from the previous year. The oil brand once again was a clear winner with nearly double-digit growth.
Chocolate grew more than 10% for the quarter with a 2-year average of 6.5%. Our large chocolate countries such as India, the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Russia all turned in strong results. We are particularly pleased with our Easter performance considering that mobility restrictions are still in place, for instance, in Europe. From a brand perspective, both Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka grew double digits.
Gum and candy continue to see the impact of restricted mobility. This business declined approximately 16% during the quarter and 8% on a 2-year basis. Comparisons will become easier as we move into the second quarter, though we are expecting a gradual recovery.
Now I'll cover our market share performance on Slide 15. We continue to see good share performance. Given the unique impact of COVID on results, we have switched to a 2-year cumulative 4 percentage of revenue gaining or holding share as we feel it better depict how we are truly doing. In Q1, we held or gained share in 80% of our revenue. Biscuits and chocolates were the big drivers holding or gaining share in 85% of our revenue base. Gum and candy held or gained 35%. Notable share gainers included U.S., China and Russia biscuit and Russia and Australia chocolate. It is important to understand that the year-to-date category growth of 3% does not reflect some major channels. Using the same methodology, the 2-year average category growth rate is approximately 5%, which reflects the elevated demand in Q1 2020, particularly in North America.
Now let's review our profitability performance on Slide 16. Overall, profitability was strong in the first quarter. We grew gross profit by 5% due to strong volume leverage, productivity and revenue growth management partially offset by some commodity and logistics increases. Operating income dollars increased nearly 13% due to overhead reduction and simplification efforts, which helped offset COVID-related costs of approximately $25 million. Importantly, we continue to invest in our plans to a mid-single-digit investments in A&C, including a double-digit increase in working media.
Moving to regional performance on Slide 17. Europe revenue grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3.8% on a 2-year basis. The U.K., Germany and Russia all delivered strong results. OI dollars increased 8.6%. North America declined 2.3% in the quarter with a 2-year average growth of 5.6%. Biscuit posted a low single-digit increase on top of strong double-digit growth in the previous year quarter. While gum and candy saw double-digit declines. Our venture business unit, which combines States, Give & Go, Hu, Perfect Snacks and Enjoy Life do strongly, both organically and on a pro forma basis.
North America operating income declined 3.6% as a result of volume dynamics. as well as some extra cost to serve due to winter storms in February. AMEA posted exceptional growth of 10.8% and a 2-year average of 6.5%. India delivered extraordinary growth underpinned by great execution and robust consumption in chocolate and biscuit. India growth on a 2-year average was double digit and higher than pre-COVID rates. China continued to demonstrate momentum with double-digit growth. These results were driven by continuous strength in biscuit. China growth on a 2-year average was double digits.
AMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 37% due to significant volume leverage as well as cost mitigation efforts despite continued working media increases. Latin America grew 7.2% in Q1 and 7.1% on a 2-year average. Brazil grew double digits, driven by strong market growth in biscuits and chocolate as well as good performance in powdered beverages. Eastern was executed well by the team. Mexico and Western India declined mid-single digits due to category softness in Gum & Candy, while biscuit delivered strong growth. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America grew nearly 10%.
Now turning to earnings per share on Slide 18. Q1 EPS increased more than 10% at constant currency, driven mostly by operating gains.
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Page 19. I We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the first quarter, higher earnings, lower restructuring and very strong working capital management with a 10-day improvement in our conversion cycle helped drive these results. We deployed more than $1 billion to repurchase shares at attractive prices during the dislocation in the first 2 months of the quarter. We also paid out $450 million in dividend, representing an 11% increase versus the previous year.
Moving to our outlook on Page 21. I would start by saying that we expect the continuation of the same trend and momentum experienced in Q1 going into the rest of the year. Consumers continuing to snack more for both mental and physical well-being, elevated at home consumption with restriction fluctuating but still present, consumers preferring trusted quality brands and strength in mass retail and higher sustained e-commerce adoption.
We also expect vaccination efforts to help gradually unlock mobility over time but remain prudent in our planning for parts of the business that will benefit from this, such as world travel retail and gum. Also some markets are reestablishing lockdowns and some uncertainty remains. Our strong start to the year and continued recovery in emerging markets provide an increased level of confidence in our ability to deliver a strong 2021. Having said that, COVID still creates an element of uncertainty and volatility.
So we are reaffirming our original 2021 outlook or 3% plus revenue growth. If some of the elements of volatility dissipate in the coming months, we might be in a position to revisit the outlook in our Q2 call. From a profit standpoint, we expect high single-digit growth for EPS. This reflects our current view of top line, some incremental commodity and transportation inflation for the year that despite being higher than originally planned remains manageable. In addition, we will continue investing in the business to propel our virtual cycle. We also continue to expect free cash flow of $3 billion plus. ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.10 on the year.
All the elements of the outlook are based on current conditions and do not factor in a material degradation of the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID.
To sum up, we feel good about where we stand and remain focused on delivering on full year commitments. We are winning share. We are driving a virtual cycle with impactful high-return investments. We are driving leverage in our business and emerging and developed markets are performing well.
With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Well, just to put the numbers back in front of us. So it's about 10% of growth in the quarter and then 7% on average for the last 2 years. It was broad-based with double-digit growth in Brazil, in India, in China and in Russia -- or high single digit",662,"Yes. Well, just to put the numbers back in front of us. So it's about 10% of growth in the quarter and then 7% on average for the last 2 years. It was broad-based with double-digit growth in Brazil, in India, in China and in Russia -- or high single digit in Russia, sorry. And the contribution to the growth was coming from our global brands and from our local brands. So I would say strong across the board. Maybe some of the countries where we have gum and candy business a little bit less, but we're talking about Mexico or some of the Central American countries or Thailand, but not the big emerging markets. 
Obviously, the big question is what's going to happen with COVID in these big markets? And is it going to affect the consumer? So if I go through them one by one, China is operating well. COVID is under control, I would say. There's a return to mobility. And if there is a rise in COVID cases, they lockdown quickly an area, contract trace and move on. So I think China, we can be relatively sure that, that is going to continue.
The next one, India, the performance was very strong in the first quarter. But at the same time, we've seen near the end of the quarter and then into the second quarter, big rise in cases driven by religious festivities, state elections and then probably some fatigue. At the moment, the restrictions are only about 10%. So 10% of the population is under severe lockdown, and these lower type of restrictions do not materially affect the access to our products. But if these restrictions would be more expanded, that could give us some pockets of disruption to our opinion. But overall, I think life continues. People clearly have migrated to our brands, which are trusted brands and they offer a lot of food safety also. So we're expecting a strong quarter in India even in the current circumstance for Q2.
And then Brazil, as you know, in Q1 was heavily affected by COVID. We still have a serious impact. But we see chocolate and biscuit consumption clearly growing. But of course, the gum and candy is still impacted by the lockdowns. In Brazil, just like in the other countries, we're seeing very positive trends in our market shares also. And then Russia, I would say, is also in a relatively difficult COVID situation, but it does not affect consumption.
So I feel confident that in these 4 biggest BUs and then some of the other ones, we will be able to sustain growth. And there's a number of underlying factors that will drive that, one would be, for instance, distribution expansion. In China, we've added 500,000 stores over the last 2 years. In India, we've done about 360,000 stores. We have huge opportunity in getting to more stores as I was talking about in the call before. And then India is entering to the choco bakery space, too, where we think there's a big opportunity, and our biscuit business is growing very fast. So I think also based on those factors that we feel strong about the emerging markets. 
Maybe one thing, Andrew, because this is maybe the moment to talk about COVID and the India situation as a side remark. But obviously, our hearts go out with everyone in India and the struggle that the country is going through. The safety of our colleagues is our number one priority. And we are giving all the support we can to our local team. And this week, we are going to donate at least $2 million to the government and to the health care workers to provide critical medical infrastructure like oxygenators and other equipment. So I just wanted to make sure that we are aware of what's going on in India. And as a company, we are planning to do whatever we can to help."

And I guess, potentially also give you more comfort, obviously, in your margin expectations in a rising sort of inflationary environment?"

So we are clearly encouraged by the strong start to the year and the quality of our results. It's remarkable to see share gains, continuing volume and price both contributing in a meaningful way to top line and profitability and free cash flow ahead of last year. As Dirk just said, we are very happy with emerging markets that have truly come back since the pickup, the COVID prices last year in Q2. And the last 3 quarters over there have been aligned in terms of trends to the pre-COVID levels or even better. And same goes for developed markets that -- for which consumption is higher than the 2019 baseline. So we are optimistic about the fundamentals and the ability that we have to execute a 2021 plan. But we know, as if just said in India, there is some volatility, and we want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. And so reaffirming our original plan. At this point, we believe is really the right approach. Having said that, you're right, we are cautiously optimistic about the ability to over-deliver versus the original guidance. But I want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. It is early in the year. And -- but just to reassure that we have all the investments aligned in the plan. And actually, we have unlocked some additional investments, particularly in places where I think the situation is experiencing great momentum.
In terms of inflation, there is more inflation coming. And so profitability is great in Q1. We believe we are going to hit the numbers as we had originally in mind. But the higher inflation will require some additional pricing and some additional productivities to offset the impact, which I believe at this point is absolutely manageable given that all these positions are pretty much hedged for 2021. And so as I said, profitability should be good, in line with what we told you at the end of last quarter. And we feel like we can price away the inflation and commit again to a high single-digit EPS as per the original guidance."

So if there would be a larger acquisition that would provide us the opportunity to get bigger in snacking or get an accelerated -- and/or get an accelerated growth rate, we're certainly open to it. But it's just very difficult to find and we're hesitant. We would probably be open to get into other areas of snacking, but we are hesitant to get into other food categories, which are showing less growth.

It grew double-digit in Q1, and we are expecting good growth again in Q2. And all that within a situation where COVID cases are increasing dramatically. One thing to keep into account before I talk about all the good things that management has been doing is that the composition of our product range in Brazil is fundamentally different from a Mexico or what we call WACAM, which is Colombia, Peru, Chile and Central America. Those Mexico and WACAM have a very important share of their business is driven by gum and candy. And as a consequence, they suffer more in this crisis. Brazil has a bigger biscuits and chocolate business, and they're doing quite well, increasing market share. We've stepped up investments. We've also improved our customer service. I think the team also has increased or improved their internal process in a big way, made the business much simpler to manage. They've brought in some extra talent. So yes, clearly, management is driving a change in the way the business is operating, and it's showing in the results. 
I would say for the other businesses, the problem is different from what we had in Brazil. We were not performing in the Brazilian market in biscuits and chocolate. It's largely in Mexico and WACAM, we need to make sure that the gum and candy business comes back. And so we will see how that goes. We see it come back step by step, but it's going to take a while."

We have invested in working media in -- that is going double digit, sales execution, route to market and in capital in our facilities.
Having said that, there is higher inflation in the marketplace. And if you look even at this quarter and the composition of pricing and volume, pricing is a little bit more pronounced than it has been historically. So we are pricing more and we are pricing away inflation. We are not necessarily going all the time with lease price increases. We use a lot of revenue growth management techniques within the company. Those provide a better impact for consumers and elasticity. We will protect free price point, particularly in emerging markets and price pack architecture is a key element of price increases throughout both emerging markets and developed markets. We are clearly optimizing promo spending. We are optimizing mix. Mix is still negative in Quarter 1 because of gum and world travel retail. But when you strip that out and you look at biscuits and chocolate, it is better than it has been in the past. And also, we want to improve trade deals ROI. 
So to cut it short, We feel confident that we can price away inflation. And we are never going for the big bank depending on what the current situation is in terms of commodities in ForEx. But it is a gradual implementation of pricing over time. And obviously, given where we stand in terms of overall inflation, as we go into next year, we will have to price."

So overall, I would say, for this year, we're expecting modest gains on the back of the very strong gains that we had last year, but we do expect to continue to increase our market share. In Q1, on a global basis, we continue to increase our share, not as strong as last year, but still quite good, more than it has been in the past. Of course, as we get into March and April and in some countries, we don't have the full results yet, that's where we start to lap some of our largest step-up in share gains that we had last year. And so it's a bit too early for us to say how that's going to pan out. But overall, we do expect a good year and the reason being is that some of the things we're doing like distribution increase, execution against seasonals, increase in our investments, the ROI we're seeing on some of our marketing is all pointing in the round -- sorry, in the right direction. And so we believe that the base is there to continue gaining share.
Another one that I didn't mention, but it's the increased penetration of our brands in the last 12 months. We have about 150 million households globally that are now consuming our products. So I don't think that's going to go away right away, and that is going to be the base that is going to help us to continue to gain share. 
We think it's more helpful since we have a big step up last year, and we will, in some markets, give back a little bit, I'm assuming in the coming months. So I think the net result over the 2 years is what is most important. That's why we thought it would be better to start showing the 2-year cumulative share.
As I said before, we have all the right things in place. We're seeing a continuation of that in Q1, and we think that we still will have a good year."

On the other spectrum, I would say Hu, smaller brand, still investing in getting distribution in getting the brand build up huge potential, biggest -- or fastest selling chocolate brand in Whole Foods, but we need to build up distribution. So for the time being, we're probably going to run a loss on Hu as we build up the brand. All the other ones, I would say, if I think about Perfect Snacks, Grenade and Dates, they all have strong EBITDA in line or above with the EBITDA of the company. And they are in sort of the $100 million to $150 million mark in sales. And so they all have huge distribution opportunities, which we are continuing to build with them. And so our expectation is that they are profitable, that they will contribute to our overall profitability, but that's not the main role. Their main role is to grow as fast as we possibly can.

Now thinking it through what's going to happen going forward, I believe that it could probably be a tailwind. And the reason why is that I -- and I'm talking, let's call it, 2 years from now. In emerging markets, things will come back. Mobility will come back. And it's -- we see big growth in snacking. This quarter, as they came back, emerging markets were growing close to 10% for us. So I think there is momentum in emerging markets. Emerging markets are growing 7% on average over the last 2 years. There is momentum there. And as they get through COVID and the consumer gets back into their normal life, I think we will see a benefit to that.
In developed markets, I think consumers will use this as a change in the way they live. And they will not spend as much time in the office, and they will spend more time at home. And we clearly know that as the consumer spends more time at home, that benefits our categories, particularly biscuits, but also chocolate. So if I think about it not immediate in the next year because there will still be a lot of ins and outs.

We've made some adaptations to it during the crisis and at the moment, we're reviewing to see if we can build on sort of another level of sophistication and understanding of what really drives it. But the basics are still there. I would say that the areas where we've been working on for sure, is simplifying the business more. We have too many SKUs, too many small innovations and so on, and that makes life really complicated for our teams and for supply chain. So we've been focused on that. We also starting to understand our marketing approach better and better. We -- our brands are really driving. I think our teams have done an incredible job in better understanding purpose of our brands and really then making it come alive. We get great returns on our investments. And so I think we're going to continue that and try to lift that to the next level. 
As it relates to channels, for sure, we have to adapt our strategy, e-commerce, 77% growth in the first quarter after already a big boom last year. So e-commerce, I think in the coming years, will continue to grow very fast. We think discounters is another area that will be important. And we will have to see where the balance between grocery and big stores versus on the go and away from home will pan out, and that might require some adaptations. So I would say overall, the list of opportunities that we have or to grow has not changed and as we confirmed itself, we might change the sort of the weight or the priority of it, but the ones I went through in the presentation are still very valid. And the enablers of the growth are still very valid and are working for us. So it's more about prioritization than changes, to my opinion."

I mean as we saw inflation spiking, we have been doing a little bit more pricing and optimizing the overall revenue growth management mix. And so that's part of the answer. We have delivered a great quarter in terms of productivity. The colleagues that we have around the world working supply chain have done a remarkable job. And the goal for us is really to make sure that while protecting all employees around the world, COVID costs are pretty much absorbed by productivity and happy to report that in the quarter, the COVID costs were only inverted commas, obviously, $25 million. And then I think overall, when you look at the composition of profitability, we are very pleased with increasing profitability. You see not only in Latin America, which I think is quite good. And that is on the back of our teams in Brazil, for instance, optimizing returns on Easter that are this year at historical levels compared to last year. But also and importantly, all the volume leverage that came through AMEA, which is again proving to us if we didn't know that while this company has tremendous potential in revenue, that revenue, if it comes through the right mix of price and volume, it delivers tremendous upside to the bottom line. And also, as you saw, Alexia, in terms of cash flow.
So it was better than we anticipated. I think it was better because, again, we priced a bit more. Productivities came in strongly and importantly, particularly in AMEA, but not only volume was strong, and it was also the case, obviously, in EU. And in the U.S., when you look at the 2-year stack on profit, I think we can call ourselves happy with the delivery of that."

It is because we have good profitability in India and China that delivered amazing growth in Q1. When you look at the P&L structure of these 2 companies, it is a sound P&L that allows for reinvestment. And so that came after we invested more in advertising. And again, I want to stress the fact that emerging markets can be profitable, can be cash accretive. And AMEA is the point in time. We come from a place where we have invested in supply chain. And we have great state-of-the-art facilities in both India and China as a specific example, and putting volume on top of it is just going to yield great results also going forward. So that's really when we say emerging markets in action. You look at the AMEA P&L and you realize how that can really come to fruition, not only in this quarter but for the years to come. And so it is a structural advantage. We just have to keep on being disciplined in pricing and delivering volume. And I think things will take care of themselves if we continue investing in route to market. And we gave you the idea of the opportunities that we still have in these places, whether it is biscuits, for instance, in India or whether it is number of stores in China and chocolate, obviously.
I think in North America, I wouldn't get overly concerned about the margins. I think in North America, obviously, this quarter is facing some additional pressure in terms of logistics costs. And you all know that edible oils with, et cetera, they have been going up in terms of cost. But we are taking the necessary measures to optimize profitability and total dollar delivery a little bit more. Again, I don't want to take away the fact that on a 2-year average, when you look at the net benefit versus '19, it is still a 17%, 16% OI increase versus the 2019 baseline, which again, I think, is quite good."

Again, I think we need to look at the fundamentals of how we want to run this company. Volume is integral part of the incentive scheme for the countries and for us, obviously, at the center and for the regions too. It is clearly a key contributor in places like AMEA, where we have tremendous leverage potential. There might be other places where we will have to price a little bit more, and there will be some volume consequences. So I think you will see still volume growth. It might be slightly less than what happened last year. And importantly, both volume market share and gross profit dollars are critical part of the incentive scheme. And so it will be the optimization of the 3 elements that will eventually determine how much we will deliver in pricing versus volume. Remember also in the second part of the year, we will start lapping meaningful volume declines in gum and world travel retail. And the simple year-over-year comparison should help that, partially offset potentially by tougher comparisons in developed markets, particularly in North America. So I feel quite good in telling you that the balance will still be there. Maybe it will be a little bit more tilted to price this year."

We had a strong start to the year despite lapping our highest growth quarter in 2020 and Q1 reconfirms that we are emerging from COVID even stronger. Our performance demonstrates that our strategy is working and that we have clear growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving a virtuous cycle and producing a consistent track record of growth. 
As we continue to deliver on our commitments, we are also strengthening our business by accelerating investments, reshaping our portfolio and simplifying the business while maintaining cost discipline. We are well positioned to accelerate long-term revenue and earnings growth. 
On Slide 5, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. Top line growth was 3.8%, underpinned by broad-based share gains and excellent execution across all geographies, categories and brands. Our teams around the world delivered amazing results with events like Chinese New Year and Easter being clear standouts. In turn, the strong volume and price-driven top line translated into gross profit dollar growth of 5%, also aided by our emerged stronger cost initiatives. 
We continue to invest in our brands and sales and marketing capabilities to drive our categories. We also increased working media double digits to support further share gains. And a good business converts top line results into cash. And for the quarter, we generated $700 million, which is the best first quarter since the formation of the company, which continues to enable us for strong capital return to our investors. In summary, our first quarter results leave us well positioned to deliver on our full year 2021 outlook and provide increased confidence that we can accelerate our long-term growth rate. 
On Slide 6, let me spend a moment on our track record, which we expect to continue. Q1 top line results marked another quarter at or above our long-term growth algorithm of 3% plus, now averaging 3.8% growth since late 2018. This is happening because we have fundamentally changed our approach to the business. From a focus on costs and profit margins, we have switched to top line growth and profit dollars, which has driven better and more consistent results. 
Our local first commercial approach enables us to move faster and be more consumer-centric. We have entered a virtuous financial algorithm, which allows us to invest more in the business. And lastly, our incentives are better aligned with an ownership and growth mindset with increased accountability and high-quality outcomes. 
Beyond Q1 results and 2021 expected outcomes, as shown on Slide 7, we believe we are uniquely well positioned to thrive in the years ahead with a long runway of growth opportunities and advantaged growth enablers. First, our core categories are attractive and resilient, demonstrating durable growth and significant headroom for future upside. Second, we believe our growth algorithm and our ability to continue to invest behind strong growth propositions is something that sets us apart from our competition and will continue to result in share gains over the years ahead. Third, we are seizing large opportunities in under-indexed channels like e-commerce and discounters. Fourth, we have significant opportunities to expand in high-growth segments like well-being and premium and in geographies where we have a strong share of 1 core category but a much lower share of another. And beyond our core categories, we are building strong platforms in high-growth adjacencies such as cakes and pastries or bars. 
We believe we have distinct advantages that will enable us to seize these opportunities. These include our proven ability to price across the globe, more impactful and high-return marketing, increased investments in our brands, ongoing portfolio reshaping to increase our exposure to incremental high-growth areas of snacking, continued cost improvements to fuel investments and increased business clarity and simplification. 
On Slide 8, you can see the strong progress we have made in Q1 against some of our biggest growth opportunities. Within our core business, we achieved double-digit growth in Cadbury Dairy Milk and high single growth in Oreo. Oreo has been growing at a double-digit CAGR since 2018 as we activate our planned trade group and pursue a $1 billion opportunity over the next 3 years via geographical expansion and share gains. We also delivered mid-single-digit growth in our local jewels, including strong results from Chips Ahoy! and Tate's in biscuit as well as Côte d'Or and Lacta in chocolate. Continued efforts to revitalize brand messaging, packaging and activations have created a growth engine within a substantial part of our portfolio. 
Looking at our channel opportunities, the consumer shift to e-commerce continues to accelerate growing 77% on a reported basis in the first quarter with share gains in the U.S., China and the U.K. E-commerce represented approximately 6% of our revenue in Q1. This has not come at the expense of brick-and-mortar, where we continue to drive distribution gains in key emerging markets like China, where we added 120,000 stores in the last quarter or in India where we added 60,000. To put that China figure in context, in China biscuits, we are now in 3 million stores out of 6 million that formed the Nielsen universe. So we have a huge headroom. And in gum, we are only in 1.9 million of 6 million stores, and our leading competitor is in 4.2 million stores. 
As it relates to the opportunity in high-growth segments, we significantly increased our presence in well-being and premium this quarter with the acquisitions of Grenade, Gourmet Food and Hu. And finally, we continue to expand in close in adjacencies, becoming the lead manufacturer in the U.K. snack bars category with Grenade. 
Since the launch of our strategy, we have enhanced our portfolio by adding nearly $1 billion in revenue with a number of high-growth platforms, as you can see on Slide 9. These acquisitions are driving accelerated growth and have a long runway. Our balance sheet provides a great flexibility and optionality, particularly through our coffee JVs. While we are very happy with the results and prospects of both KDP and JDE, our expectation is to increase our exposure to snacking over time. And in 2020, we sold down our stakes in both with $2 billion of net proceeds to convert into a highly strategic snacking acquisitions. 
We are also evaluating our developed market gum business to determine the best way forward. Across these initiatives, we are driving clear outcomes in the form of accelerated growth. 
Next, I will share some additional color on these recent acquisitions and how they'll align with our strategy on Slide 10. Our focus has always been to increase our exposure to high-growth segments like premium and well-being, enter geographic wide spaces in our core categories or expand into fast-growing adjacencies. Most recently, we acquired 4 fast-growing companies. Grenade, the U.K. energy protein bar, the leader that is allowing us to expand our snacking portfolio into active nutrition products. It was a missing piece to become the largest players in the $1.2 billion U.K. snack bar market. 
Gourmet Food, which is a premium and well-being focused cracker portfolio in Australia. This platform allows us to significantly increase our Australia biscuits business and share. The brand has tremendous growth potential inside and outside of Australia and is a leader in a highly attractive segment. 
Hu is a premium well-being chocolate-led lifestyle brand that has developed a very strong followership. It is the fastest moving chocolate brand in Whole Foods but currently has limited presence in more conventional retailers, which is a clear opportunity. 
And Give & Go is an undisputed leader in the large and high-growth in-store bakery segment in North America. It is highly incremental and spans across multiple product forms like cookies, muffins, brownies and cupcakes. It has strong consumer appeal, driven by high-quality freshness and permissible indulgence. This platform is performing very well, and we believe it will yield good revenue and cost synergies. 
As we have seen with our prior acquisitions of Tate's and Perfect Snacks, these platforms provide leadership positions in new or adjacent categories of increasing relevance with our consumers. Tate's represent large addressable markets, are financially attractive and create new growth path for us. 
Turning to Slide 11 and our sustainability commitments and approach. We believe we can create value by building a sustainable snacking company that is focused on sustainability -- or sorry, sustainably sourced ingredients, minimizing our climate and landscape impact, building a diverse, inclusive and engaged workforce, selling products that meet the evolving snacking needs of consumers and result in zero packaging waste. We are confident that our approach is effective as we prioritize according to where we have the largest impact. We focus on breakthrough solutions, and we collaborate when needed. 
In closing, our strong start to the year gives us increasing conviction that the steps we are taking to evolve our growth strategies are the right ones and that they will continue to support consistent and profitable growth for many years to come. 
With that, I will hand to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

In developed markets, we continue to see solid consumption and are pleased with our performance, given the elevated demand in the previous year quarter. These markets were in positive growth territory for the quarter, while the 2-year average growth was 4%.
Turning to Slide 14 and performance by category. Biscuits grew plus 3.4% in Q1 and plus 7.6% on a 2-year average. Each of our big countries delivered double-digit growth during the quarter, while our large U.S. business posted low single-digit growth against very elevated growth from the previous year. The oil brand once again was a clear winner with nearly double-digit growth.
Chocolate grew more than 10% for the quarter with a 2-year average of 6.5%. Our large chocolate countries such as India, the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Russia all turned in strong results. We are particularly pleased with our Easter performance considering that mobility restrictions are still in place, for instance, in Europe. From a brand perspective, both Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka grew double digits.
Gum & Candy continue to see the impact of restricted mobility. This business declined approximately 16% during the quarter and 8% on a 2-year basis. Comparisons will become easier as we move into the second quarter, though we are expecting a gradual recovery.
Now I'll cover our market share performance on Slide 15. We continue to see good share performance. Given the unique impact of COVID on results, we have switched to a 2-year cumulative 4 percentage of revenue gaining or holding share as we feel it better depict how we are truly doing. In Q1, we held or gained share in 80% of our revenue. Biscuits and chocolates were the big drivers holding or gaining share in 85% of our revenue base. Gum & Candy held or gained 35%. Notable share gainers included U.S., China and Russia biscuit and Russia and Australia chocolate. It is important to understand that the year-to-date category growth of 3% does not reflect some major channels. Using the same methodology, the 2-year average category growth rate is approximately 5%, which reflects the elevated demand in Q1 2020, particularly in North America.
Now let's review our profitability performance on Slide 16. Overall, profitability was strong in the first quarter. We grew gross profit by 5% due to strong volume leverage, productivity and revenue growth management partially offset by some commodity and logistics increases. Operating income dollars increased nearly 13% due to overhead reduction and simplification efforts, which helped offset COVID-related costs of approximately $25 million. Importantly, we continue to invest in our brands to a mid-single-digit investments in A&C, including a double-digit increase in Working Media.
Moving to regional performance on Slide 17. Europe revenue grew 3.3% in the quarter and 3.8% on a 2-year basis. The U.K., Germany and Russia all delivered strong results. OI dollars increased 8.6%. North America declined 2.3% in the quarter with a 2-year average growth of 5.6%. Biscuit posted a low single-digit increase on top of strong double-digit growth in the previous year quarter. While Gum & Candy saw double-digit declines. Our venture business unit, which combines Tate's, Give & Go, Perfect Snacks, Hu and Enjoy Life, grew strongly, both organically and on a pro forma basis.
North America operating income declined 3.6% as a result of volume dynamics. as well as some extra cost to serve due to winter storms in February. AMEA posted exceptional growth of 10.8% and a 2-year average of 6.5%. India delivered extraordinary growth underpinned by great execution and robust consumption in chocolate and biscuit. India growth on a 2-year average was double digit and higher than pre-COVID rates. China continued to demonstrate momentum with double-digit growth. These results were driven by continuous strength in biscuit. China growth on a 2-year average was double digits.
AMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 37% due to significant volume leverage as well as cost mitigation efforts despite continued working media increases. Latin America grew 7.2% in Q1 and 7.1% on a 2-year average. Brazil grew double digits, driven by strong market growth in biscuits and chocolate as well as good performance in powdered beverages. Easter was executed well by the team. Mexico and Western India declined mid-single digits due to category softness in Gum & Candy, while biscuit delivered strong growth. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America grew nearly 10%.
Now turning to earnings per share on Slide 18. Q1 EPS increased more than 10% at constant currency, driven mostly by operating gains.
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Page 19. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the first quarter, higher earnings, lower restructuring and very strong working capital management with a 10-day improvement in our conversion cycle helped drive these results. We deployed more than $1 billion to repurchase shares at attractive prices during the dislocation in the first 2 months of the quarter. We also paid out $450 million in dividend, representing an 11% increase versus the previous year.
Moving to our outlook on Page 21. I would start by saying that we expect the continuation of the same trend and momentum experienced in Q1 going into the rest of the year. Consumers continuing to snack more for both mental and physical well-being, elevated at-home consumption with restriction fluctuating but still present, consumers preferring trusted quality brands and strength in mass retail and higher sustained e-commerce adoption.
We also expect vaccination efforts to help gradually unlock mobility over time but remain prudent in our planning for parts of the business that will benefit from this, such as World Travel Retail and gum. Also some markets are reestablishing lockdowns and some uncertainty remains. Our strong start to the year and continued recovery in emerging markets provide an increased level of confidence in our ability to deliver a strong 2021. Having said that, COVID still creates an element of uncertainty and volatility.
So we are reaffirming our original 2021 outlook or 3% plus revenue growth. If some of the elements of volatility dissipate in the coming months, we might be in a position to revisit the outlook in our Q2 call. From a profit standpoint, we expect high single-digit growth for EPS. This reflects our current view of top line, some incremental commodity and transportation inflation for the year that despite being higher than originally planned remains manageable. In addition, we will continue investing in the business to propel our virtual cycle. 
We also continue to expect free cash flow of $3 billion plus. ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.10 on the year. All the elements of the outlook are based on current conditions and do not factor in a material degradation of the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID.
To sum up, we feel good about where we stand and remain focused on delivering on full year commitments. We are winning share. We are driving a virtual cycle with impactful high-return investments. We are driving leverage in our business and emerging and developed markets are performing well.
With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Well, just to put the numbers back in front of us. So it's about 10% of growth in the quarter and then 7% on average for the last 2 years. It was broad-based with double-digit growth in Brazil, in India, in China and in Russia -- or high single digit",667,"Yes. Well, just to put the numbers back in front of us. So it's about 10% of growth in the quarter and then 7% on average for the last 2 years. It was broad-based with double-digit growth in Brazil, in India, in China and in Russia -- or high single digit in Russia, sorry. And the contribution to the growth was coming from our global brands and from our local brands. So I would say strong across the board. Maybe some of the countries where we have Gum & Candy business a little bit less, but we're talking about Mexico or some of the Central American countries or Thailand, but not the big emerging markets. 
Obviously, the big question is what's going to happen with COVID in these big markets? And is it going to affect the consumer? So if I go through them one by one, China is operating well. COVID is under control, I would say. There's a return to mobility. And if there is a rise in COVID cases, they lockdown quickly an area, contract trace and then -- contact trace, sorry, and move on. So I think China, we can be relatively sure that, that is going to continue.
The next one, India, the performance was very strong in the first quarter. But at the same time, we've seen near the end of the quarter and then into the second quarter, big rise in cases driven by religious festivities, state elections and probably some fatigue. At the moment, the restrictions are only about 10%. So 10% of the population is under severe lockdown, and these lower type of restrictions do not materially affect the access to our products. But if these restrictions would be more expanded, that could give us some pockets of disruption to our opinion. But overall, I think life continues. People clearly have migrated to our brands, which are trusted brands and they offer a lot of food safety also. So we're expecting a strong quarter in India even in the current circumstance for Q2.
And then Brazil, as you know, in Q1 was heavily affected by COVID. We still have a serious impact. But we see chocolate and biscuit consumption clearly growing. But of course, the gum and candy is still impacted by the lockdowns. In Brazil, just like in the other countries, we're seeing very positive trends in our market shares also. And then Russia, I would say, is also in a relatively difficult COVID situation, but it does not affect consumption.
So I feel confident that in these 4 biggest BUs and then some of the other ones, we will be able to sustain growth. And there's a number of underlying factors that will drive that, one would be, for instance, distribution expansion. In China, we've added 500,000 stores over the last 2 years. In India, we've done about 360,000 stores. We have huge opportunity in getting to more stores as I was talking about in the call before. And then India is entering to the choco bakery space, too, where we think there's a big opportunity, and our biscuit business is growing very fast. So I think also based on those factors that we feel strong about the emerging markets. 
Maybe one thing, Andrew, because this is maybe the moment to talk about COVID and the India situation as a side remark. But obviously, our hearts go out with everyone in India and the struggle that the country is going through. The safety of our colleagues is our number one priority. And we are giving all the support we can to our local team. And this week, we are going to donate at least $2 million to the government and to the health care workers to provide critical medical infrastructure like oxygenators and other equipment. So I just wanted to make sure that we are aware of what's going on in India. And as a company, we are planning to do whatever we can to help."

So we are clearly encouraged by the strong start to the year and the quality of our results. It's remarkable to see share gains, continuing volume and price both contributing in a meaningful way to top line and profitability and free cash flow ahead of last year. As Dirk just said, we are very happy with emerging markets that have truly come back since the pickup, the COVID prices last year in Q2. And the last 3 quarters over there have been aligned in terms of trends to the pre-COVID levels or even better. And same goes for developed markets that -- for which consumption is higher than the 2019 baseline. So we are optimistic about the fundamentals and the ability that we have to execute a 2021 plan. But we know, as Dirk just said in India, there is some volatility, and we want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. And so reaffirming our original plan at this point, we believe is really the right approach. Having said that, you're right, we are cautiously optimistic about the ability to over-deliver versus the original guidance. But I want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. It is early in the year. And -- but just to reassure that we have all the investments aligned in the plan. And actually, we have unlocked some additional investments, particularly in places where I think the situation is experiencing great momentum.
In terms of inflation, there is more inflation coming. And so profitability is great in Q1. We believe we are going to hit the numbers as we had originally in mind. But the higher inflation will require some additional pricing and some additional productivities to offset the impact, which I believe at this point is absolutely manageable given that all these positions are pretty much hedged for 2021. And so as I said, profitability should be good, in line with what we told you at the end of last quarter. And we feel like we can price away the inflation and commit again to a high single-digit EPS as per the original guidance."

It grew double-digit in Q1, and we are expecting good growth again in Q2. And all that within a situation where COVID cases are increasing dramatically. One thing to keep into account before I talk about all the good things that management has been doing is that the composition of our product range in Brazil is fundamentally different from a Mexico or what we call WACAM, which is Colombia, Peru, Chile and Central America. Those Mexico and WACAM have a very important share of their business is driven by Gum & Candy. And as a consequence, they suffer more in this crisis. Brazil has a bigger biscuits and chocolate business, and they're doing quite well, increasing market share. We've stepped up investments. We've also improved our customer service. I think the team also has increased or improved their internal process in a big way, made the business much simpler to manage. They've brought in some extra talent. So yes, clearly, management is driving a change in the way the business is operating, and it's showing in the results. 
I would say for the other businesses, the problem is different from what we had in Brazil. We were not performing in the Brazilian market in biscuits and chocolate. It's largely in Mexico and WACAM, we need to make sure that the Gum & Candy business comes back. And so we will see how that goes. We see it come back step by step, but it's going to take a while."

We have invested in Working Media in -- that is going double digit, sales execution, route to market and in capital in our facilities.
Having said that, there is higher inflation in the marketplace. And if you look even at this quarter and the composition of pricing and volume, pricing is a little bit more pronounced than it has been historically. So we are pricing more and we are pricing away inflation. We are not necessarily going all the time with lease price increases. We use a lot revenue growth management techniques within the company. Those provide a better impact for consumers and elasticity. We will protect free price point, particularly in emerging markets and price-pack architecture is a key element of price increases throughout both emerging markets and developed markets. We are clearly optimizing promo spending. We are optimizing mix. Mix is still negative in quarter 1 because of gum and World Travel Retail. But when you strip that out and you look at biscuits and chocolate, it is better than it has been in the past. And also, we want to improve trade deals ROI. 
So to cut it short, we feel confident that we can price away inflation. And we are never going for the big bank depending on what the current situation is in terms of commodities and ForEx. But it is a gradual implementation of pricing over time. And obviously, given where we stand in terms of overall inflation, as we go into next year, we will have to price."

And then from a market share standpoint, it looked like the momentum continued in Q1 on a 2-year basis. Can you give us a little more of a near-term update of what you're seeing in March and April as you cycle some of the incremental share gains from last year? And are you seeing any competitive response in the marketplace to the share gains you've seen recently? I guess, indirectly, that ties the first question around pricing, but I'd be curious for competitive response and what you're seeing from competitors?"

So overall, I would say, for this year, we're expecting modest gains on the back of the very strong gains that we had last year, but we do expect to continue to increase our market share. In Q1, on a global basis, we continue to increase our share, n",341,"Yes. So overall, I would say, for this year, we're expecting modest gains on the back of the very strong gains that we had last year, but we do expect to continue to increase our market share. In Q1, on a global basis, we continue to increase our share, not as strong as last year, but still quite good, more than it has been in the past. Of course, as we get into March and April and in some countries, we don't have the full results yet, that's where we start to lap some of our largest step-up in share gains that we had last year. And so it's a bit too early for us to say how that's going to pan out. But overall, we do expect a good year and the reason being is that some of the things we're doing like distribution increase, execution against seasonals, increase in our investments, the ROI we're seeing on some of our marketing is all pointing in the around -- sorry, in the right direction. And so we believe that the base is there to continue gaining share.
Another one that I didn't mention, but it's the increased penetration of our brands in the last 12 months. We have about 150 million households globally that are now consuming our products. So I don't think that's going to go away right away, and that is going to be the base that is going to help us to continue to gain share. 
We think it's more helpful since we have a big step up last year, and we will, in some markets, give back a little bit, I'm assuming in the coming months. So I think the net result over the 2 years is what is most important. That's why we thought it would be better to start showing the 2-year cumulative share.
As I said before, we have all the right things in place. We're seeing a continuation of that in Q1, and we think that we still will have a good year."

So I would say the group of acquisitions is all on strategy, but it's very different of where in the development these different brands are. So the profit contribution is largely depending on how big and where they are in their development. So to give you the 2 extremes, potentially Give & Go mature business, strong profitability, growing high single digits in the first quarter. So a big contribution to our profitability. 
On the other spectrum, I would say Hu, smaller brand, still investing in getting distribution in getting the brand build up, huge potential, biggest -- or fastest selling chocolate brand in Whole Foods, but we need to build up distribution. So for the time being, we're probably going to run a loss on Hu as we build up the brand. All the other ones, I would say, if I think about Perfect Snacks, Grenade and Tate's, they all have strong EBITDA in line or above with the EBITDA of the company. And they are in sort of the $100 million to $150 million mark in sales. And so they all have huge distribution opportunities, which we are continuing to build with them. And so our expectation is that they are profitable, that they will contribute to our overall profitability, but that's not the main role. Their main role is to grow as fast as we possibly can. So hopefully, that gives you an idea how we think about it."

And so if you could just kind of maybe give us a little bit of color on how we should think about those considerations. Is the cost basis in this business goes all the way back to when Cadbury bought Adams, right? So I don't even know what the cost basis is. But as we're thinking about exit vehicles, were we really thinking about tax efficiency and maybe those types of structures. And again, this is a business that could be worth, I guess, $1.5 billion or more. So just trying to understand how we should think about cash -- the cash inflow potential."

And if you look at it, we grew 3.7% last year. We're growing 3.8% in the first quarter of this year. Last year, we saw big gains in biscuits and in chocolate, but we had Gum & Candy really going the opposite way. We had emerging markets slowing down, but developed markets stepping up. So the balance -- the net balance, and I keep on referring to that, net balance has been that, in the end, for us, there has not been that big of an effect, and that continues into Q1.
Now thinking it through what's going to happen going forward, I believe that it could probably be a tailwind. And the reason why is that I -- and I'm talking, let's call it, 2 years from now. In emerging markets, things will come back. Mobility will come back. And it's -- we see big growth in snacking. This quarter, as they came back, emerging markets were growing close to 10% for us. So I think there is momentum in emerging markets. Emerging markets are growing 7% on average over the last 2 years. There is momentum there. And as they get through COVID and the consumer gets back into their normal life, I think we will see a benefit to that.
In developed markets, I think consumers will use this as a change in the way they live. And they will not spend as much time in the office, and they will spend more time at home. And we clearly know that as the consumer spends more time at home, that benefits our categories, particularly biscuits, but also chocolate. So if I think about it not immediate in the next year because there will still be a lot of ins and outs. But during the crisis, it was kind of a neutral effect; getting out of it, I think it's going to have a tailwind for us."

We've made some adaptations to it during the crisis and at the moment, we're reviewing to see if we can build on sort of another level of sophistication and understanding of what really drives it. But the basics are still there. I would say that the areas where we've been working on for sure, is simplifying the business more. We have too many SKUs, too many small innovations and so on, and that makes life really complicated for our teams and for supply chain. So we've been focused on that. We also starting to understand our marketing approach better and better. We -- our brands are really driving. I think our teams have done an incredible job in better understanding purpose of our brands and really then making it come alive. We get great returns on our investments. And so I think we're going to continue that and try to lift that to the next level. 
As it relates to channels, for sure, we have to adapt our strategy, e-commerce, 77% growth in the first quarter after already a big boom last year. So e-commerce, I think in the coming years, will continue to grow very fast. We think discounters is another area that will be important. And we will have to see where the balance between grocery and big stores versus on the go and away from home will pan out, and that might require some adaptations. So I would say, overall, the list of opportunities that we have or to grow has not changed and has reconfirmed itself, we might change the sort of the weight or the priority of it, but the ones I went through in the presentation are still very valid. And the enablers of the growth are still very valid and are working for us. So it's more about prioritization than changes, to my opinion."

I mean as we saw inflation spiking, we have been doing a little bit more pricing and optimizing the overall revenue growth management mix. And so that's part of the answer. We have delivered a great quarter in terms of productivity. The colleagues that we have around the world working supply chain have done a remarkable job. And the goal for us is really to make sure that while protecting all employees around the world, COVID costs are pretty much absorbed by productivity and happy to report that in the quarter, the COVID costs were only, obviously, ""$25 million."" And then I think overall, when you look at the composition of profitability, we are very pleased with increasing profitability. You see not only in Latin America, which I think is quite good. And that is on the back of our teams in Brazil, for instance, optimizing returns on Easter that are this year at historical lows compared to last year. But also and importantly, all the volume leverage that came through AMEA, which is again proving to us if we didn't know that while this company has tremendous potential in revenue, that revenue, if it comes through the right mix of price and volume, it delivers tremendous upside to the bottom line. And also, as you saw, Alexia, in terms of cash flow.
So it was better than we anticipated. I think it was better because, again, we priced a bit more. Productivities came in strongly and importantly, particularly in AMEA, but not only volume was strong, and it was also the case, obviously, in EU. And in the U.S., when you look at the 2-year stack on profit, I think we can call ourselves happy with the delivery of that."

It is because we have good profitability in India and China that delivered amazing growth in Q1. When you look at the P&L structure of these 2 companies, it is a sound P&L that allows for reinvestment. And so that came after we invested more in advertising. And again, I want to stress the fact that emerging markets can be profitable, can be cash accretive. And AMEA is the point in time. We come from a place where we have invested in supply chain. And we have great state-of-the-art facilities in both India and China as a specific example, and putting volume on top of it is just going to yield great results also going forward. So that's really when we say emerging markets in action. You look at the AMEA P&L and you realize how that can really come to fruition, not only in this quarter but for the years to come. And so it is a structural advantage. We just have to keep on being disciplined in pricing and delivering volume. And I think things will take care of themselves if we continue investing in route to market. And we gave you the idea of the opportunities that we still have in these places, whether it is biscuits, for instance, in India or whether it is number of stores in China and chocolate, obviously.
I think in North America, I wouldn't get overly concerned about the margins. I think in North America, obviously, this quarter is facing some additional pressure in terms of logistics costs. And you all know that edible oils with, et cetera, they have been going up in terms of cost. But we are taking the necessary measures to optimize profitability and total dollar delivery a little bit more. Again, I don't want to take away the fact that on a 2-year average, when you look at the net benefit versus '19, it is still a 17%, 16% OI increase versus the 2019 baseline, which again, I think, is quite good."

Again, I think we need to look at the fundamentals of how we want to run this company. Volume is integral part of the incentive scheme for the countries and for us, obviously, at the center and for the regions, too. It is clearly a key contributor in places like AMEA, where we have tremendous leverage potential. There might be other places where we will have to price a little bit more, and there will be some volume consequences. So I think you will see still volume growth. It might be slightly less than what happened last year. And importantly, both volume market share and gross profit dollars are critical part of the incentive scheme. And so it will be the optimization of the 3 elements that will eventually determine how much we will deliver in pricing versus volume. Remember also in the second part of the year, we will start lapping meaningful volume declines in gum and World Travel Retail. And the simple year-over-year comparison should help that, partially offset potentially by tougher comparisons in developed markets, particularly in North America.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge our colleagues, our suppliers and our customers around the world who continue to navigate through the pandemic, particularly in markets where COVID vaccines are not yet widely available. We continue to work hard to accelerate access to vaccines for our colleagues, and sincerely appreciate everyone's efforts to maintain the supply and availability of our products.
We had a strong first half executing our strategy well and leveraging our advantaged enablers to deliver against our growth drivers. The strong first half gives us the confidence to raise our full year revenue growth outlook to 4%-plus. We are seeing improving mobility trends in many places, helping to drive recovery in areas such as World Travel Retail and Gum & Candy that was negatively impacted last year. We also see continued strong demand for the categories and channels that experienced elevated demand last year due to COVID.
Once again, this quarter, we have demonstrated that our strategy is working as it is driving a virtuous cycle that is consistently delivering a profitable, volume-driven top line and bottom line growth as well as good returns to our shareholders. We are leveraging our revenue growth management capability which is particularly important in this inflationary environment to generate fuel for continued investment in our brands and capabilities. And we continue to reshape our portfolio to further increase our focus on snacking as well as to accelerate our long-term growth rate.
To this end, we announced in Q2 an agreement to acquire Chipita, which I will speak more about later. After this strong first half of the year and strong previous years, I remain even more confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to deliver continued and accelerated growth.
Turning to Slide 5 and the headlines of our financial performance. We grew revenue by 6.2% in the quarter and 5% for the half lapping 3.7% growth in the first half of 2020. Despite cost inflation, which continues to be a factor in our sector, we grew gross profit faster than revenue. We achieved this through volume leverage, pricing actions and continued cost discipline. This profitable growth funded another quarter of double-digit increase in working media spend.
Our A&C investment, combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and excellent execution continued to deliver strong share performance. On a 2-year cumulative basis, we are gaining or holding share across 75% of our revenue year-to-date. And in terms of cash generation and capital return, we increased our free cash flow by $300 million versus half 1 of last year and returned $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders, an increase of $0.9 billion versus half 1 2020.
Adding the Q2 revenue growth to our track record of performance since launching our strategy in late 2018, you can see on Slide 6 that we are now averaging a 4% quarterly growth rate. We achieved this by pivoting from a cost and percentage margin focus to a volume-led growth and profit dollar focus; by increasing clarity and accountability in the company through a simplified local-first commercial model where decisions are made closer to the consumer; by stepping up the investment levels in our brands and capabilities; and by better aligning our incentives to our strategy to stimulate growth-driving behaviors and a winning culture.
Driving sustained growth requires remaining close to the consumer and being informed by consumer insights, which I will discuss on Slide 7. As we enter the second half, consumer behavior around the world is still shaped by COVID, where gradual shifts in behavior continue to drive strong demand for our snacks. Globally, we are some distance away from reaching a new normal, and recovery is uneven, largely dependent on availability and adoption of vaccines.
Comfort and mental well-being remain as important as they have been throughout this pandemic, and that is leading consumers to reach for the snack brands they know and love. Variety, convenience, value and nutrition have returned as decision factors as countries begin to reopen. Mobility is increasing as restrictions ease, but at-home consumption remains elevated and it appears that higher levels of working from home and shopping online are here to stay. More time at home, the desire for trusted and comforting brands and the return of impulse and on-the-go consumption are driving sustained growth in our core categories. Year-to-date, the biscuit category has a 2-year average yearly growth rate of nearly 4% and chocolate is growing almost 6%.
Solidly growing core categories are the first of a long runway of growth opportunities that we have illustrated on Slide 8. The runway is long, and we are realizing these opportunities by leveraging our strong enablers such as increased brand investment, higher quality and purpose-led marketing and pricing ability. As a consequence, this quarter, we continue to make progress against our key growth drivers. These include driving category growth and share gains in our core categories through impactful partnerships like the Premier League with Cadbury in the U.K., the U.S. Olympics team with Oreo and the AMEA with Trident. Also expanding our presence in key channels like digital commerce, which grew 14% this quarter on a reported basis after close to triple-digit growth last year.
We are also expanding our presence in emerging markets where we continue to gain distribution in key countries like China and India with another 60,000 and 20,000 stores added this quarter. We are increasing our exposure to high-growth segments where we are underrepresented, for example, premium, where we have recently integrated dates on to our U.S. DSD system and are seeing the benefits through accelerated strong double-digit growth this year. And finally, we are also increasing our foothold in adjacent categories like cakes and pastries, where we are now realizing the potential of acquisitions like Give & Go in North America. We are also launching innovations like Oreo Muffins.
Moving to Slide 9. Let me speak for a minute about the attractiveness of the package cakes and pastries category and our expansion into it. This is a $65 billion category, growing at or above the rate of our core snacks categories. It also has attractive profitability. Both cakes and pastries typically have a higher net revenue per kilogram than cookies. It is a close adjacency to our core biscuit capabilities, and it is a fragmented category which provides a clear opportunity for a company with the right brands and capabilities to gain a leadership position.
The #1 and #2 players have a market share below 10%. And following the acquisition of Chipita, we will be the #3 player. And finally, we believe we can add value and premiumize the category by leveraging our brands, and you can see a few examples of that on the slide.
Starting with LU in Europe, the #1 cookie brand in France, which is now building its presence in the cakes and pastries aisles. That includes the well beloved petit beurre biscuit reimagined as a soft cake. And recently, the brand is expanding even further into waffles in the highly incremental pastries space.
On Oreo, we have recently expanded from our core cookies into cupcakes, doughnuts and more by leveraging our Give & Go platform in North America. Our products bring the Oreo taste and quality.
And finally, Milka, the #1 chocolate brand in France, Germany and Austria, which we initially took into the cookie aisle through our chocobakery innovation. Milka has now expanded into soft cakes like brownies and will soon expand into croissants through the Chipita acquisition. And you can imagine we will do the same with Cadbury in the countries where Cadbury is our main chocolate brand.
We firmly believe that the leadership position in the cakes and pastries category can contribute to an accelerated growth rate for our company. And between our core brands and recent acquisitions, we have the tools to succeed.
Now let's dive a little deeper on Chipita on Slide 10. We're very excited about acquiring this attractive portfolio, which is led by the 7Days brand. It is a $600 million business, growing high single digit and skewed towards European emerging markets with strong potential to expand its presence in many other geographies. The portfolio is predominantly prepackaged croissants, which give us greater exposure to the breakfast or prelunch consumption occasion. We have clear revenue synergies with Chipita including distribution and co-branding, and we believe there is other attractive innovation in the pipeline. We also expect to realize efficiency opportunities.
This will be our seventh acquisitions since 2018, which will combine to add $1.5 billion of revenue to our business. We also sold down a further $1 billion of KDP stock in Q2 which will part fund the Chipita acquisition. We look forward to welcoming Chipita on board, and believe this business can be a strong growth engine.
In conclusion, as you can see from our first half performance, executing our strategy continues to deliver strong results. I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver consistent and profitable growth for years to come. With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Our second quarter performance was strong across the board.

Revenue for the",1400,"Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered robust top line growth, healthy gross profit dollar growth that allowed reinvestment in our brands and attractive free cash flow. Revenue for the quarter increased by 6.2%. Growth was broad based and volume led. Pricing, which was favorable across all regions, was also a key contributor. Emerging market performance was strong, growing more than 16% for the quarter and more than 5% on a 2-year basis, despite India being affected at the beginning of the quarter by COVID-related lockdowns. In India, the situation improved in June, and growth trends have already been restored in line with what we saw in quarter 1. Of note, these emerging market results include double-digit growth in Brazil, India, Russia and Mexico and high single-digit growth in China. We remain encouraged by the resiliency and underlying strength of our emerging market, while we continue to invest behind attractive growth opportunities for the long term.
Developed markets also performed well with robust consumption trends continuing. This market grew 1.3% during Q2, coming off elevated demand in 2020. The 2-year average growth for Q2 was nearly 3% and more than 3% for half 1.
Turning to Slide 13 and portfolio performance. Biscuits grew 2.8% in Q2 and 6% on a 2-year average. Brazil, Russia and Mexico posted double-digit growth, while Germany grew high single digit in this category. Our North America business declined low single digits, lapping double-digit growth in 2020. Chocolate grew more than 12% for the quarter with a 2-year average of 5.9%. India, Brazil, Germany and Russia all posted strong results despite some restrictions in India. Cadbury, Milka Lacta and Toblerone all grew significantly during the quarter. Toblerone's results reflect growth from improving mobility trends in world travel retail, albeit this business is only at around 40% of 2019 levels.
Gum & Candy posted strong double-digit growth, resulting from improving mobility trends and lapping the big COVID restrictions in 2020. This business grew 28% during the quarter but still declined over 7% on a 2-year basis. We expect growth to be better for the second half of the year as mobility generally improves. Yet, we are still cautious about gum category dynamics, that is still at 80% of the 2019 levels. And our full year outlook does not imply a full recovery to pre COVID.
Now I'll cover our market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance. Given the unique impact of COVID on results, last quarter, we switched to a 2-year cumulative for percentage of revenue gaining or holding share, as we feel it better depicts how we are truly performing. On a 2-year cumulative basis as of June, we have held or gained share in 75% of market and category combinations. Biscuits and chocolate continue to be the primary drivers of this performance as they held or gained in 80% of our revenue base. Notable share gainers on a 2-year basis include the U.S., China, Russia and Brazil biscuits and Germany, Russia and South Africa chocolate. Gum & Candy held or gained in 50% improving since the last quarter, primarily due to the U.S. candy performance.
Now let's review our profitability on Slide 15. Overall, profitability was strong in the second quarter and year-to-date. Gross profit grew faster than revenue, increasing more than 7% due to strong volume leverage, productivity, line pricing and revenue growth management initiatives that helped to offset inflation in commodities, logistics and labor. As we said many times, inflation and commodity costs are higher than we originally anticipated at the start of 2021, but we continue to believe that they are managed both. And we are holding to our original stance as far as investments are concerned.
Having said that, we are managing gross profit dollars for the year, and there might be some pressure points in the second half. In addition, our goal is to enter 2022 with a sound profitability level that will enable higher investment in 2022.
Operating income dollars also increased by more than 7%.
Moving to regional results on Slide 16. Europe revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter and 2% on a 2-year basis with OI dollars of plus 15%. North America declined slightly at minus 0.3% in the quarter with a 2-year average growth of 5.2%. Operating income declined minus 7.2% in the quarter because of volume and mix dynamics as well as some cost inflation that was more pronounced in this region than others.
AMEA posted growth of plus 7% and a 2-year average of 1.8%, which includes the big COVID lockdowns in Q2 of last year. India delivered another quarter of exceptional growth despite a challenging start related to lockdowns, growing strong double digits. India grew on a 2-year average mid-single digit. AMEA operating income dollars grew more than 7% in the quarter due to volume leverage as well as cost mitigation efforts with substantial brand and working media investment increases.
Latin America grew 33.7% in Q2 and 8.9% on a 2-year average, aided by Brazil that grew by double digits. OI dollar in Latin America grew significantly over previous year due to top line growth and mix as gum is on a recovery path.
Now turning to EPS on Slide 17. Q2 EPS increased 1.6% at constant currency, driven mostly by operating gains, which were partially offset by the lapping of a onetime tax benefit in previous year quarter. First half EPS increased 8.6% at constant currency, primarily due to operating gains and despite lapping a onetime tax impact last year.
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the second quarter, bringing us to $1.4 billion for the first half. We also repurchased approximately 1.5 billion in shares in the first half at attractive prices. Dividend growth remains an important part of our capital allocation approach. And to that end, we announced another increase of 11% to our cash dividend today. This represents an increase of almost 85% over the past 5 years.
Moving to our outlook on Slide 20. As a result of first half strength, continued category durability and healthy demand trends in both emerging and developed markets, we are increasing our full year net revenue growth to plus 4%-plus. With the first half at plus 5%, the implied growth rate for the half 2 is at least 3%. We remain prudent in the way we plan the business, whether it relates to channels such as World Travel Retail and categories like gum, which are beginning to benefit from an improvement in mobility. We are also mindful that there is still a significant degree of volatility on a global basis as many countries find themselves in different stages as it relates to vaccines rollout, COVID transmission and restrictions.
In terms of EPS, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year. We have not factored in the full benefit of the top line additional growth as we will continue to reinvest the volume-driven upside back in the business to sustain our share performance. We also continue to expect free cash flow generation of $3 billion-plus for the year, as some additional coffee-related taxes are now factored into our outlook.
ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.09 on the year based on current market rates. As said, our updated outlook is based on current conditions and does not factor in a material degradation in the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID.
We also expect to continue executing against our plans in revenue growth management, including pricing and simplification in order to offset some of the inflationary costs related to commodities, logistics and labor that we expect to be incrementally higher in the second half of the year. As already said, we want to enter 2022 with the strong margins that will allow the combination of the virtuous cycle and high investment level.
To close, we remain focused on consistently executing against our strategy. This means continued investment in our brand, driving core growth, expanding in underserved channels, doubling down on high-growth segments and capturing new opportunities in closing adjacencies, like cakes and pastries and bars. With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

You probably saw that we had a strong emerging market performance in Q2 with 16% growth in the quarter and now a 5% growth on a 2-year average basis. It would have been probably higher but we had disruption in India COVID cost in May. And so if you look around, I would say, you look at the big markets, we have strong double-digit growth in all the BRIC countries for the quarter, so Brazil, India, Russia and then the high single-digit growth in China. So there's nothing there.
I would say of those countries, there's always a potential maybe, except for China, that COVID will cause some volatility, particularly a country like India looks more susceptible to it. But overall, they seem to be on a path of a gradual increase. China, I mean, operating well. COVID seems to be under control. They're returning to mobility. And we've seen a constantly improving category performance. And on top, we have strong share gains, sometimes like in gum 3 points year-to-date.
If I look at India, they bounced back in June of the crisis of April and May, and the daily cases are now at 10% of what the peak was. So the short-term risk of further disruption remains significant due to the slow vaccine rollout and new variants. But if I look at the long-term prospects, I believe they still are very strong. And our team there is executing the strategy very well, doing more investment increasing the range and driving more distribution.
And then Brazil had very strong growth, double-digit net revenue and now also double digit on a 2-year CAGR. The COVID nervousness is still there. And then the chocolate and biscuit consumption is growing while the Gum & Candy, which, as you know, is very heavily affected by COVID, is still negative by the reduced mobility.
In Brazil, we see the vaccine rollout accelerating and it's starting to have an impact. And so we expect mobility in Brazil in the second half to be quite strong. And we also see some share gains in biscuits in Brazil. So in the big markets, I cannot say, apart from what I just said, that there would be major surprises.
I would say, at this stage, Southeast Asia is particularly affected, and so that's going to take a few months probably. We have transmissions peaking in Vietnam and Indonesia. Q2 was flat against 2019, so we have to monitor that very closely.
And then the Middle East and Africa, in general, they are in growth on a 2-year basis, but that's also a part of the world that I would say we need to remain careful, and I don't think they have fully recovered.
If I look at Latin America, the smaller markets, Mexico, slight growth on a 2-year basis now. They had a tough year last year, coming back quite nicely. The rest of the smaller markets, probably not quite there yet, still below the 2019 levels. That's also driven by the fact that our Gum & Candy business is quite important in those markets. And then the European emerging markets, apart from Russia, they remain strong. So I would say overall, there are smaller markets that are affected at the moment, but the big emerging markets are doing well. Volatility remains, but I would largely see that in India and Southeast Asia and potentially Africa. But overall, I think the mix of our emerging markets, over time, will keep on showing more stability and a gradual increase versus 2019."

In terms of share gains, the peak of the share gains were last year in Q2. And as we said many times, it was fairly consistent across the board.

And as we said many times, it was fairly consistent across the board. Our top countries and our middle-sized countries in both chocolate and biscuit posted tremendous share gains. And obviously, the 75%, 80% share gains that we're talking about, don't give full justice to the absolute amount of shares. And so by lapping the peak last year, what I can tell you today is that we are fairly happy with the overall result over the 2-year period. And we intend to keep it as it is as of Q2 and potentially slightly growing those share gains in the second part of the year.
In terms of dynamics, the amount of A&C that we are going to invest for the second part of the year is pretty much in line with what you have seen so far in the first half. Obviously, Q2 last year, we kind of cut a little bit A&C because we were [ impossibilitated ] to do business in certain places, particularly in emerging markets. But when you look on the face of it, the increment in the second part of the year will be lower. But in terms of run rate and absolute numbers, it is absolutely in line with the first part of the year.
In terms of pricing and inflation, I would say there is going to be more in the second part of the year. To start with our pipeline of commodities and ForEx has been advantageous in the first part of the year, and we expect some commodities and ForEx impact to be relatively higher in the second part. So there will be some more pressure in Q3 specifically. But we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of cost and pricing. And the overall goal for us is to enter 2022, a, with some strong share momentum; and two, with some GP level that will enable continued investment.
So as I said, Q3 will be more pressured than Q4. But I think at this point in time, have line of sight to incremental pricing. We have line of sight to incremental volume. And we have line of sight certainly to more of what we call RGM, which is critical for us as we continue to support our brands and with the ultimate goal to again, as I said, to enter 2022 with a strong momentum."

So if I look at the household penetration in the last 12 months, globally, we have an increase of about 150 million households which we are holding on to. That is not falling back. The other area that I see is not necessarily going to lead to share gains, but I think it will lead to strong categories is this combination of an at-home consumption that is lower than it was -- slightly lower than it was last year but still significantly higher than it was in 2019. But that is then sort of buildup or there's a build-on from mobility increases. And the impulse channel coming back and giving a strong growth in Gum & Candy as well as in biscuits and chocolate. And so that, I think, would be a second factor that will influence this.
And then I -- as Luca was saying, we are lapping the highest share increases that we had last year. That was, of course, a combination of our brands and the performance of our brands, but also the fact that our supply chain last year kind of worked better than some of our competitors. That effect we knew over time was going to go away. But in the second half of the year, those huge increases driven by our supply chain performance last year are gone, so we'll be lapping market share increases that are milder. And on top, we're expecting, as we did in the second quarter, but also in the third and the fourth quarter to continue to increase our working media spend in a significant way. So I expect that also to contribute to the market share gain.
So what we expect to happen is that by the end of this year, the market share gains that we had at the end of last year will have retained or potentially increased a little bit."

It was a little bit, but not really significantly, I would say. Now if the news continues to worsen like the CDC is saying today that even vaccinated people in certain circumstances should start to wear masks again. The fact that consumers might stay at home longer because the returning to work is not as evident after Labor Day at the moment, I think we might see a sort of a repeat of previous situations. I don't think it will lead to massive stocking at home. But the increased consumption at home, I think, will continue for a while. So at the moment, for instance, the food consumption at home still shows a 15% spend increase versus 2019. I think that will continue well into the third quarter and potentially in the fourth quarter. And the  out-of-home eating is still not quite there. It's still 5% down, the spending there versus what it was in 2019. But the consumer is venturing out more, which also helps our snacking category. So I think overall, our categories will benefit. But I do not expect that we will see massive sort of stocking and retailers struggling with replenishment."

It is, for the most part of it, a phenomenon that we saw in North America but it is not only limited to North America.

Obviously, given the fact that we have in the U.S. a DSD system, which is a captive system, which is on-lease trucks, et cetera, we are somewhat more insulated than others, but it is definitely a pressure point. We called out in general inflation because there is more than logistics and freight. There is also some packaging costs that is high. And in general, [ commerce ] and co-pack are rising cost with us.
In terms of we have been guiding to high single digit, that is of the base that has been restated. And there is a little bit of an upside driven by the incremental revenue. But the most part of the upside is being reinvested back in the business. You might imagine, Rob, that as we might implement more pricing around the world, and given also the high share that we are retaining, we want to enter 2022, a, with strong share momentum; and b, with a level of profitability that is allowing us to continue to reinvest.

So labor inflation and any other type of inflation that is in there. We are benefiting from the fact that volume is growing 4.4% in the quarter, and that is providing leverage in our factories as well, obviously. But I think it's fair to say also that all the actions that we have put in place in the last few years in terms of simplification, for instance, of the portfolio, the fact that we continue to invest our CapEx mostly behind productivity initiatives is giving us benefits. And that is particularly evident in places like Latin America and AMEA that have a good rate of net productivity. Clearly, in the U.S., where, as I said, logistics inflation, which is part of productivity is higher is somewhat muting a bit the benefit that we are having in conversion costs.
In terms of mix, I called out during the prepared remarks that as you think about World Travel Retail, which is a $0.25 billion business in 2019 or a little bit less, it is still running at 40% of what we used to be in 2019. And this is a business that runs with a much higher gross profit because it is mostly World Travel Retail, which is Toblerone and it is sold at a very premium to the rest of the portfolio.
The other one, obviously, is gum. I said that it is 80% of what it used to be in 2019. It is 5% of the total revenue that we have. And again, that is a line of business that runs with a GP margin that is relatively higher to the rest of the portfolio. So I don't want to embark in giving you an exact mix number. What I can tell you is that if we restore the business to the levels of 2019, it will be a material impact and positive impact in terms of dollars that will drop to the bottom line.
As I said, think about gum running at 20% higher than it is today or World Travel Retail running at 60% higher than it is today, that will be a material benefit to the bottom line and to the profitability. It is fair to say that you haven't seen a big impact last year or this year because we have been able to offset it through a lot of cost measures that are embedded into the P&L. In fact, when you look at the overhead line, we are very happy with what we have. And I think that is the reason why we're holding profit at good levels and increasing it by 10% in the first half despite double-digit A&C. Thank you, Alexia."

First of all, there is stopping production. And so not reducing certain SKUs anymore. Second is then having those SKUs not in inventory anymore. And then third, having those SKUs not in the store anymore. So those are the 3 levels. Where we are at the moment is that of that 25%, most of it, the production has been stopped. We're gradually running out of inventory. We didn't want to write off the inventory, which would give us a big cost effect. And then it's now starting to show up in-store. In-store, we're not yet down 25%, but it's increasing rapidly.
The effect of that sort of trickle reduction is going to be that I don't think you will see an effect on our top line, and that is really should go by almost unnoticed that we have 25% less SKUs. Keep in mind also that, that 25% was kind of 2% or 3% of our total net revenue. And if we manage it well in-store, and keep the same shelf space and replace those 25% with faster rotating SKUs, we could even gain sales.
On innovation, in a business like ours, innovation is kind of 3 things. It's, first of all, what we call renovation, it's existing SKUs that we have to renovate, update, make more interesting. Second, there is then innovation within the core news flavors and so on. And then there's what we call innovation beyond the core, which is new to market type of segments or new types of products.
What we have been aiming for in our innovation approach is that renovation part and that sort of new flavors part. That's where we believe we can reduce a little bit the amount of activity that we have, and we've been doing that also around the 25% mark. And that has led to bigger renovations or bigger sort of within the core innovations. And we're seeing the benefit from that. And it's clearly showing up in the way our net revenue growth is being composed.
Where we still have work to do is what we call beyond the core. We're working that hard. We're trying to shift some resources to that. That requires a longer lead time, requires more investment, but over time, can give a significant growth for the company. So what I would say here also, the 25% reduction has given an upside to us. And we are very happy with the way our innovation contribution to growth is panning out at the moment."

Sorry, I can't -- I didn't understand the question the first time, it was a bit interrupted for me. But from an elasticity perspective, our categories are showing what I would say, an average elasticity from what I've seen to other food categories. And it depends a little bit where you are in which market around the world.
In developed markets where most of the sales are through supermarkets and done in larger packs, there are price points, but they're probably not as solid. And for instance, in Germany, the price per kilo is extremely important, while in France, the exact price point where that pack normally is sold is much more important. And so it's a mixed picture. But I would say we can more easily move things up or down. And then again, when we talk about pricing, you should not just think about direct price increase. It's also what we call price pack architecture. It's the amount and the depth of promotions that we have and at some of the trade activities that we deploy. So pricing is a big word or is sort of a grouping of a number of activities, which might not necessarily immediately translate in a lasting effect for the consumer who suddenly sees the price change.
In emerging markets, it's slightly different. There, it's really about price points and you need to maintain those price points. So in general, what we do there is we work much harder on productivities, reducing of packaging, improving the cost of our ingredients, improving the cost of our distribution and so on. Also making sure that we work hard on price pack architecture and so on. So that's a bit more of a difficult approach where you need to stick to the price points. And usually, when you have to move away from a price point, the elasticity effect shows quite considerably in your volumes. And so the game is played slightly different there.
So I hope that explains a little bit the 2 ways that we manage elasticity. But I would say in North America and Europe, in general, the way we're doing it, and as you probably heard in previous discussions, our price movements are bigger than previous year but not massive. And that's thanks to that RGM approach, I would say. We are able to deal with the elasticity that comes from it. And an example is a 4%-plus volume growth we've seen in this quarter.
As it relates to acquisitions, acquisitions that we've done so far have added about $1.5 billion to our top line. The idea is that they grow high single digits, and so you can probably calculate what they add to our top line growth. I would say it's probably in the order of 0.3% growth. Our plan is to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. It's difficult to say how much and when and at which growth rate. But in general, when we announced our strategy, we always said that we were counting on a 3%-plus organic growth, and then we would complement that with growth through acquisition. In that thinking, we were thinking that about 0.5, 0.6 growth would come eventually from acquisitions. So that's more or less what we have in mind.
We haven't done that many acquisitions yet, and it will probably still take us a few years before we got a significant math that would lead to that 0.5, 0.6. But that's sort of our thinking as it relates to the contribution of acquisition."

Firstly, I want to acknowledge our colleagues, our suppliers and our customers around the world who continue to navigate through the pandemic, particularly in markets where COVID vaccines are not yet widely available. We continue to work hard to accelerate access to vaccines for our colleagues and sincerely appreciate everyone's efforts to maintain the supply and availability of our products.
We had a strong first half, executing our strategy well and leveraging our advantaged enablers to deliver against our growth drivers. The strong first half gives us the confidence to raise our full year revenue growth outlook to 4% plus. We are seeing improving mobility trends in many places, helping to drive recovery in areas such as World Travel Retail and Gum & Candy that was negatively impacted last year. We also see continued strong demand for the categories and channels that experienced elevated demand last year due to COVID.
Once again, this quarter, we have demonstrated that our strategy is working as it is driving a virtuous cycle that is consistently delivering a profitable, volume-driven top line and bottom line growth as well as good returns to our shareholders. We are leveraging our revenue growth management capability, which is particularly important in this inflationary environment to generate fuel for continued investment in our brands and capabilities. And we continue to reshape our portfolio to further increase our focus on snacking as well as to accelerate our long-term growth rate.
To this end, we announced in Q2 an agreement to acquire Chipita, which I will speak more about later. After this strong first half of the year and strong previous years, I remain even more confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to deliver continued and accelerated growth.
Turning to Slide 5 and the headlines of our financial performance. We grew revenue by 6.2% in the quarter and 5% for the half lapping 3.7% growth in the first half of 2020. Despite cost inflation, which continues to be a factor in our sector, we grew gross profit faster than revenue. We achieved this through volume leverage, pricing actions and continued cost discipline. This profitable growth funded another quarter of double-digit increase in working media spend.
Our A&C investment, combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and excellent execution, continued to deliver strong share performance. On a 2-year cumulative basis, we are gaining or holding share across 75% of our revenue year-to-date. And in terms of cash generation and capital return, we increased our free cash flow by $300 million versus half 1 of last year and returned $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders, an increase of $0.9 billion versus half 1 2020.
Adding the Q2 revenue growth to our track record of performance since launching our strategy in late 2018, you can see on Slide 6 that we are now averaging a 4% quarterly growth rate. We achieved this by pivoting from a cost and percentage margin focus to a volume-led growth and profit dollar focus, by increasing clarity and accountability in the company through a simplified local-first commercial model where decisions are made closer to the consumer, by stepping up the investment levels in our brands and capabilities, and by better aligning our incentives to our strategy to stimulate growth-driving behaviors and a winning culture.
Driving sustained growth requires remaining close to the consumer and being informed by consumer insights, which I will discuss on Slide 7. As we enter the second half, consumer behavior around the world is still shaped by COVID, where gradual shifts in behavior continue to drive strong demand for our snacks. Globally, we are some distance away from reaching a new normal, and recovery is uneven, largely dependent on availability and adoption of vaccines.
Comfort and mental well-being remain as important as they have been throughout this pandemic, and that is leading consumers to reach for the snack brands they know and love. Variety, convenience, value and nutrition have returned as decision factors as countries begin to reopen. Mobility is increasing as restrictions ease, but at-home consumption remains elevated, and it appears that higher levels of working from home and shopping online are here to stay. More time at home, the desire for trusted and comforting brands, and the return of impulse and on-the-go consumption are driving sustained growth in our core categories. Year-to-date, the biscuit category has a 2-year average yearly growth rate of nearly 4% and chocolate is growing almost 6%.
Solidly growing core categories are the first of a long runway of growth opportunities that we have illustrated on Slide 8. The runway is long, and we are realizing these opportunities by leveraging our strong enablers such as increased brand investment, higher quality and purpose-led marketing, and pricing ability. As a consequence, this quarter, we continue to make progress against our key growth drivers. These include driving category growth and share gains in our core categories through impactful partnerships like the Premier League with Cadbury in the U.K., the U.S. Olympics team with Oreo and the NBA with Trident. 
Also expanding our presence in key channels like digital commerce, which grew 14% this quarter on a reported basis after close to triple-digit growth last year. We are also expanding our presence in emerging markets where we continue to gain distribution in key countries like China and India with another 60,000 and 20,000 stores added this quarter.
We are increasing our exposure to high-growth segments where we are underrepresented, for example, premium, where we have recently integrated Tate's onto our U.S. DSD system and are seeing the benefits through accelerated strong double-digit growth this year. And finally, we are also increasing our foothold in adjacent categories like cakes and pastries, where we are now realizing the potential of acquisitions like Give & Go in North America. We are also launching innovations like Oreo muffins.
Moving to Slide 9. Let me speak for a minute about the attractiveness of the packaged cakes and pastries category and our expansion into it. This is a $65 billion category, growing at or above the rate of our core snacks categories. It also has attractive profitability. Both cakes and pastries typically have a higher net revenue per kilogram than cookies. It is a close adjacency to our core biscuit capabilities, and it is a fragmented category, which provides a clear opportunity for a company with the right brands and capabilities to gain a leadership position.
The #1 and #2 players have a market share below 10%, and following the acquisition of Chipita, we will be the #3 player. And finally, we believe we can add value and premiumize the category by leveraging our brands, and you can see a few examples of that on the slide.
Starting with LU in Europe, the #1 cookie brand in France, which is now building its presence in the cakes and pastries aisles. That includes the well beloved Petit Beurre biscuit reimagined as a soft cake. And recently, the brand is expanding even further into waffles in the highly incremental pastries space.
On Oreo, we have recently expanded from our core cookies into cupcakes, doughnuts and more by leveraging our Give & Go platform in North America. Our products bring the Oreo taste and quality.
And finally, Milka, the #1 chocolate brand in France, Germany and Austria, which we initially took into the cookie aisle through our chocobakery innovation. Milka has now expanded into soft cakes like brownies and will soon expand into croissants through the Chipita acquisition. And you can imagine we will do the same with Cadbury in the countries where Cadbury is our main chocolate brand.
We firmly believe that the leadership position in the cakes and pastries category can contribute to an accelerated growth rate for our company. And between our core brands and recent acquisitions, we have the tools to succeed.
Now let's dive a little deeper on Chipita on Slide 10. We're very excited about acquiring this attractive portfolio, which is led by the 7Days brand. It is a $600 million business, growing high single digit and skewed towards European emerging markets with strong potential to expand its presence in many other geographies. The portfolio is predominantly prepackaged croissants, which give us greater exposure to the breakfast or pre-lunch consumption occasion. We have clear revenue synergies with Chipita including distribution and co-branding, and we believe there is other attractive innovation in the pipeline. We also expect to realize efficiency opportunities.
This will be our seventh acquisition since 2018, which will combine to add $1.5 billion of revenue to our business. We also sold down a further $1 billion of KDP stock in Q2, which will part fund the Chipita acquisition. We look forward to welcoming Chipita onboard and believe this business can be a strong growth engine.
In conclusion, as you can see from our first half performance, executing our strategy continues to deliver strong results. I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver consistent and profitable growth for years to come.
With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financial performance."

Revenue for the",1403,"Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered robust top line growth, healthy gross profit dollar growth that allowed reinvestment in our brands and attractive free cash flow. Revenue for the quarter increased by 6.2%. Growth was broad based and volume led. Pricing, which was favorable across all regions, was also a key contributor. Emerging market performance was strong, growing more than 16% for the quarter and more than 5% on a 2-year basis despite India being affected at the beginning of the quarter by COVID-related lockdowns.
In India, the situation improved in June, and growth trends have already been restored in line with what we saw in quarter 1. Of note, these emerging market results include double-digit growth in Brazil, India, Russia and Mexico and high single-digit growth in China. We remain encouraged by the resiliency and underlying strength of our emerging market, while we continue to invest behind attractive growth opportunities for the long term.
Developed markets also performed well with robust consumption trends continuing. These markets grew 1.3% during Q2, coming off elevated demand in 2020. The 2-year average growth for Q2 was nearly 3% and more than 3% for half 1.
Turning to Slide 13 and portfolio performance. Biscuits grew 2.8% in Q2 and 6% on a 2-year average. Brazil, Russia and Mexico posted double-digit growth, while Germany grew high single digit in this category. Our North America business declined low single digits, lapping double-digit growth in 2020. Chocolate grew more than 12% for the quarter with a 2-year average of 5.9%. India, Brazil, Germany and Russia all posted strong results despite some restrictions in India. Cadbury, Milka, Lacta and Toblerone all grew significantly during the quarter. Toblerone's results reflect growth from improving mobility trends in World Travel Retail, albeit this business is only at around 40% of 2019 levels.
Gum & Candy posted strong double-digit growth, resulting from improving mobility trends and lapping the big COVID restrictions in 2020. This business grew 28% during the quarter but still declined over 7% on a 2-year basis. We expect growth to be better for the second half of the year as mobility generally improves. Yet, we are still cautious about gum category dynamics that is still at 80% of the 2019 levels. And our full year outlook does not imply a full recovery to pre COVID.
Now I'll cover our market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance. Given the unique impact of COVID on results, last quarter, we switched to a 2-year cumulative for percentage of revenue gaining or holding share as we feel it better depicts how we are truly performing. On a 2-year cumulative basis as of June, we have held or gained share in 75% of market and category combinations. Biscuits and chocolate continue to be the primary drivers of this performance as they held or gained in 80% of our revenue base. Notable share gainers on a 2-year basis include the U.S., China, Russia and Brazil biscuits; and Germany, Russia and South Africa chocolate. Gum & Candy held or gained in 50% improving since the last quarter, primarily due to the U.S. candy performance.
Now let's review our profitability on Slide 15. Overall, profitability was strong in the second quarter and year-to-date. Gross profit grew faster than revenue, increasing more than 7% due to strong volume leverage, productivity, line pricing and revenue growth management initiatives that helped to offset inflation in commodities, logistics and labor. As we said many times, inflation and commodity costs are higher than we originally anticipated at the start of 2021, but we continue to believe that they are manageable. And we are holding to our original stance as far as investments are concerned.
Having said that, we are managing gross profit dollars for the year, and there might be some pressure points in the second half. In addition, our goal is to enter 2022 with a sound profitability level that will enable higher investment in 2022. Operating income dollars also increased by more than 7%.
Moving to regional results on Slide 16. Europe revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter and 2% on a 2-year basis with OI dollars of plus 15%. North America declined slightly at minus 0.3% in the quarter with a 2-year average growth of 5.2%. Operating income declined minus 7.2% in the quarter because of volume and mix dynamics as well as some cost inflation that was more pronounced in this region than others.
AMEA posted growth of plus 7% and a 2-year average of 1.8%, which includes the peak COVID lockdowns in Q2 of last year. India delivered another quarter of exceptional growth despite a challenging start related to lockdowns, growing strong double digits. India grew, on a 2-year average, mid-single digit. AMEA operating income dollars grew more than 7% in the quarter due to volume leverage as well as cost mitigation efforts with substantial brand and working media investment increases.
Latin America grew 33.7% in Q2 and 8.9% on a 2-year average, aided by Brazil that grew by double digits. OI dollar in Latin America grew significantly over previous year due to top line growth and mix as gum is on a recovery path. 
Now turning to EPS on Slide 17. Q2 EPS increased 1.6% at constant currency, driven mostly by operating gains, which were partially offset by the lapping of a onetime tax benefit in previous year quarter. First half EPS increased 8.6% at constant currency, primarily due to operating gains and despite lapping a onetime tax impact last year.
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the second quarter, bringing us to $1.4 billion for the first half. We also repurchased approximately $1.5 billion in shares in the first half at attractive prices. Dividend growth remains an important part of our capital allocation approach, and to that end, we announced another increase of 11% to our cash dividend today. This represents an increase of almost 85% over the past 5 years.
Moving to our outlook on Slide 20. As a result of first half strength, continued category durability and healthy demand trends in both emerging and developed markets, we are increasing our full year net revenue growth to plus 4% plus. With the first half at plus 5%, the implied growth rate for the half 2 is at least 3%. We remain prudent in the way we plan the business, whether it relates to channels such as World Travel Retail and categories like gum, which are beginning to benefit from an improvement in mobility. We are also mindful that there is still a significant degree of volatility on a global basis as many countries find themselves in different stages as it relates to vaccines rollout, COVID transmission and restrictions.
In terms of EPS, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year. We have not factored in the full benefit of the top line additional growth on EBIT as we will continue to reinvest the volume-driven upside back in the business to sustain our share performance. We also continue to expect free cash flow generation of $3 billion plus for the year, as some additional coffee-related taxes are now factored into our outlook.
ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by approximately 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.09 on the year based on current market rates. As said, our updated outlook is based on current conditions and does not factor in a material degradation in the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID.
We also expect to continue executing against our plans in revenue growth management, including pricing and simplification in order to offset some of the inflationary costs related to commodities, logistics and labor that we expect to be incrementally higher in the second half of the year. As already said, we want to enter 2022 with the strong margins that will allow the combination of the virtuous cycle and high investment level.
To close, we remain focused on consistently executing against our strategy. This means continued investment in our brand, driving core growth, expanding in underserved channels, doubling down on high-growth segments and capturing new opportunities in closing adjacencies, like cakes and pastries and bars.
With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

Thanks, Ken, and yes, a pleasure to go into that. You probably saw that we had a strong emerging market performance in Q2 with 16% growth in the quarter and now a 5% growth on a 2-year average basis.

You probably saw that we had a strong emerging market performance in Q2 with 16% growth in the quarter and now a 5% growth on a 2-year average basis. It would have been probably higher, but we had disruption in India COVID cost in May. And so if you look around, I would say, you look at the big markets, we have strong double-digit growth in all the BRIC countries for the quarter, so Brazil, India, Russia and then the high single-digit growth in China. So there's nothing there.
I would say, of those countries, there's always a potential maybe, except for China, that COVID will cause some volatility. Particularly, a country like India looks more susceptible to it. But overall, they seem to be on a path of a gradual increase. China, I mean, operating well. COVID seems to be under control. They're returning to mobility, and we've seen a constantly improving category performance. And on top, we have strong share gains, sometimes like in gum 3 points year-to-date.
If I look at India, they bounced back in June of the crisis of April and May, and the daily cases are now at 10% of what the peak was. So the short-term risk of further disruption remains significant due to the slow vaccine rollout and new variants. But if I look at the long-term prospects, I believe they still are very strong. And our team there is executing the strategy very well, doing more investment, increasing the range and driving more distribution.
And then Brazil had very strong growth, double-digit net revenue and now also double digit on a 2-year CAGR. The COVID nervousness is still there. And then the chocolate and biscuit consumption is growing while the Gum & Candy, which, as you know, is very heavily affected by COVID, is still negative by the reduced mobility.
In Brazil, we see the vaccine rollout accelerating, and it's starting to have an impact. And so we expect mobility in Brazil in the second half to be quite strong. And we also see some share gains in biscuits in Brazil. So in the big markets, I cannot say, apart from what I just said, that there would be major surprises.
I would say, at this stage, Southeast Asia is particularly affected, and so that's going to take a few months probably. We have transmissions peaking in Vietnam and Indonesia. Q2 was flat against 2019, so we have to monitor that very closely.
And then the Middle East and Africa, in general, they are in growth on a 2-year basis, but that's also a part of the world that I would say we need to remain careful. And I don't think they have fully recovered.
If I look at Latin America, the smaller markets, Mexico, slight growth on a 2-year basis now, had a tough year last year, coming back quite nicely. The rest of the smaller markets, probably not quite there yet, still below the 2019 levels. That's also driven by the fact that our Gum & Candy business is quite important in those markets. And then the European emerging markets, apart from Russia, they remain strong. 
So I would say, overall, there are smaller markets that are affected at the moment, but the big emerging markets are doing well. Volatility remains, but I would largely see that in India and Southeast Asia and potentially Africa. But overall, I think the mix of our emerging markets, over time, will keep on showing more stability and a gradual increase versus 2019."

Is 1 of those 2 maybe a significantly larger portion of the impact to -- the incremental impact to margins in the back half of the year. And to the extent it's reinvestment to kind of hold up market share, given you're starting to lap some of the unprecedented market share gains from last year, what are you seeing that helps inform your ability to hold on to some of these share points or these share wins as you go forward?"

In terms of share gains, the peak of the share gains were last year in Q2; and as we said many times, it was fairly consistent across the board.

In terms of share gains, the peak of the share gains were last year in Q2; and as we said many times, it was fairly consistent across the board. Our top countries and our middle-sized countries in both chocolate and biscuit posted tremendous share gains. And obviously, the 75%, 80% share gains that we're talking about don't give full justice to the absolute amount of shares. And so by lapping the peak last year, what I can tell you today is that we are fairly happy with the overall result over the 2-year period, and we intend to keep it as it is as of Q2 and potentially slightly growing those share gains in the second part of the year.
In terms of dynamics, the amount of A&C that we are going to invest for the second part of the year is pretty much in line with what you have seen so far in the first half. Obviously, Q2 last year, we kind of cut a little bit A&C because we were impossibilitated to do business in certain places, particularly in emerging markets. But when you look on the face of it, the increment in the second part of the year will be lower. But in terms of run rate and absolute numbers, it is absolutely in line with the first part of the year.
In terms of pricing and inflation, I would say there is going to be more in the second part of the year. To start with, our pipeline of commodities and ForEx has been advantageous in the first part of the year, and we expect some commodities and ForEx impact to be relatively higher in the second part. So there will be some more pressure in Q3 specifically. But we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of cost and pricing. And the overall goal for us is to enter 2022, a, with some strong share momentum; and two, with some GP level that will enable continued investment.
So as I said, Q3 will be more pressured than Q4. But I think at this point in time, we have line of sight to incremental pricing. We have line of sight to incremental volume. And we have line of sight certainly to more of what we call RGM, which is critical for us as we continue to support our brands and with the ultimate goal to again, as I said, to enter 2022 with a strong momentum."

So if I look at the household penetration in the last 12 months, globally, we have an increase of about 150 million households, which we are holding on to. That is not falling back. The other area that I see as in is not necessarily going to lead to share gains, but I think it will lead to strong categories, is this combination of an at-home consumption that is lower than it was -- slightly lower than it was last year but still significantly higher than it was in 2019. But that is then sort of a buildup or there's a build-on from mobility increases and the impulse channel coming back and giving a strong growth in Gum & Candy as well as in biscuits and chocolate. And so that, I think, would be a second factor that will influence this.
And then I -- as Luca was saying, we are lapping the highest share increases that we had last year. That was, of course, a combination of our brands and the performance of our brands but also the fact that our supply chain last year kind of worked better than some of our competitors. That effect we knew over time was going to go away. But in the second half of the year, those huge increases driven by our supply chain performance last year are gone, so we'll be lapping market share increases that are milder. And on top, we're expecting, as we did in the second quarter but also in the third and the fourth quarter to continue to increase our working media spend in a significant way. So I expect that also to contribute to the market share gain. So what we expect to happen is that, by the end of this year, the market share gains that we had at the end of last year will have retained or potentially increased a little bit."

It was a little bit but not really significantly I would say. Now if the news continues to worsen like the CDC is saying today that even vaccinated people in certain circumstances should start to wear masks again, the fact that consumers might stay at home longer because the returning to work is not as evident after Labor Day at the moment, I think we might see a sort of a repeat of previous situations.
I don't think it will lead to massive stocking at home, but the increased consumption at home, I think, will continue for a while. So at the moment, for instance, the food consumption at home still shows a 15% spend increase versus 2019. I think that will continue well into the third quarter and potentially in the fourth quarter. And the out-of-home eating is still not quite there. It's still 5% down, the spending there versus what it was in 2019. But the consumer is venturing out more, which also helps our snacking category. So I think, overall, our categories will benefit, but I do not expect that we will see massive sort of stocking and retailers struggling with replenishment."

We are consistently pushing the envelope on renovation of some of these brands, and we continue investing in new packaging, in new quality, et cetera. But the overwhelming part of the investment is around working media. It is more skewed towards biscuits and chocolate, but we are also increasing, particularly in some places like China and Latin America, gum investment because we want obviously to reap the benefit of increased mobility.

It is, for the most part of it, a phenomenon that we saw in North America, but it is not only limited to North America. Ocean freight are really on the rise everywhere, and it is impossible pretty much to cover for a long period of time. And so we are facing pressure particularly in that area.
Obviously, given the fact that we have in the U.S. a DSD system, which is a captive system, which is on-lease trucks, et cetera, we are somewhat more insulated than others, but it is definitely a pressure point. We called out, in general, inflation because there is more than logistics and freight. There is also some packaging cost that is high. And in general, co-mans and co-packers are rising cost with us.
In terms of EPS, we have been guiding to high single digit. That is off the base that has been restated. And there is a little bit of an upside driven by the incremental revenue, but the most part of the upside is being reinvested back in the business. You might imagine, Rob, that as we might implement more pricing around the world and given also the high share that we are retaining, we want to enter 2022, a, with strong share momentum; and b, with a level of profitability that is allowing us to continue to reinvest.

We are benefiting from the fact that volume is growing 4.4% in the quarter, and that is providing leverage in our factories as well, obviously. But I think it's fair to say also that all the actions that we have put in place in the last few years in terms of simplification, for instance, of the portfolio, the fact that we continue to invest our CapEx mostly behind productivity initiatives is giving us benefits. And that is particularly evident in places like Latin America and AMEA that have a good rate of net productivity. Clearly, in the U.S., where, as I said, logistics inflation, which is part of productivity, is higher is somewhat muting a bit the benefit that we're having in conversion costs.
In terms of mix, I called out during the prepared remarks that as you think about World Travel Retail, which is a $0.25 billion business in 2019 or a little bit less, it is still running at 40% of what we used to be in 2019. And this is a business that runs with a much higher gross profit because it is mostly World Travel Retail, which is Toblerone, and it is sold at a very premium to the rest of the portfolio.
The other one, obviously, is gum. I said that it is 80% of what it used to be in 2019. It is 5% of the total revenue that we have. And again, that is a line of business that runs with a GP margin that is relatively higher to the rest of the portfolio.
So I don't want to embark in giving you an exact mix number. What I can tell you is that if we restore the business to the levels of 2019, it will be a material impact and positive impact in terms of dollars that will drop to the bottom line.
As I said, think about gum running at 20% higher than it is today or World Travel Retail running at 60% higher than it is today. That will be a material benefit to the bottom line and to the profitability. It is fair to say that you haven't seen a big impact last year or this year because we have been able to offset it through a lot of cost measures that are embedded into the P&L. In fact, when you look at the overhead line, we are very happy with what we have, and I think that is the reason why we're holding profit at good levels and increasing it by 10% in the first half despite double-digit A&C."

First of all, there is stopping production and so not producing certain SKUs anymore. Second is then having those SKUs not in inventory anymore; and then third, having those SKUs not in the store anymore. So those are the 3 levels.
Where we are at the moment is that of that 25%, most of it, the production has been stopped. We're gradually running out of inventory. We didn't want to write off the inventory, which would give us a big cost effect. And then it's now starting to show up in-store. In-store, we're not yet down 25%, but it's increasing rapidly.
The effect of that sort of trickle reduction is going to be that I don't think you will see an effect on our top line, and that it really should go by almost unnoticed that we have 25% less SKUs. Keep in mind also that, that 25% was kind of 2% or 3% of our total net revenue. And if we manage it well in-store and keep the same shelf space and replace those 25% with faster rotating SKUs, we could even gain sales.
On innovation, in a business like ours, innovation is kind of 3 things. It's, first of all, what we call renovation. It's existing SKUs that we have to renovate, update, make more interesting. Second, there is then innovation within the core, new flavors and so on. And then there's what we call innovation beyond the core, which is new to market type of segments or new types of products.
What we have been aiming for in our innovation approach is that renovation part and that sort of new flavors part. That's where we believe we can reduce a little bit the amount of activity that we have, and we've been doing that also around the 25% mark. And that has led to bigger renovations or bigger sort of within the core innovations. And we're seeing the benefit from that. And it's clearly showing up in the way our net revenue growth is being composed.
Where we still have work to do is what we call beyond the core. We're working that hard. We're trying to shift some resources to that. That requires a longer lead time, requires more investment but over time, can give a significant growth for the company. So what I would say here also, the 25% reduction has given an upside to us. And we are very happy with the way our innovation contribution to growth is panning out at the moment."

Sorry, I can't -- I didn't understand the question the first time. It was a bit interrupted for me.

Sorry, I can't -- I didn't understand the question the first time. It was a bit interrupted for me. But from an elasticity perspective, our categories are showing, what I would say, an average elasticity from what I've seen to other food categories. And it depends a little bit where you are in which market around the world.
In developed markets where most of the sales are through supermarkets and done in larger packs, there are price points, but they're probably not as solid. And for instance, in Germany, the price per kilo is extremely important, while in France, the exact price point where that pack normally sold is much more important. And so it's a mixed picture, but I would say we can more easily move things up or down.
And then again, when we talk about pricing, you should not just think about direct price increase. It's also what we call price pack architecture. It's the amount and the depth of promotions that we have and at some of the trade activities that we deploy. So pricing is a big word or is sort of a grouping of a number of activities, which might not necessarily immediately translate in an elastic effect for the consumer who suddenly sees the price change.
In emerging markets, it's slightly different. There, it's really about price points, and you need to maintain those price points. So in general, what we do there is we work much harder on productivities, reducing of packaging, improving the cost of our ingredients, improving the cost of our distribution and so on. Also making sure that we work hard on price pack architecture and so on. So that's a bit more of a difficult approach where you need to stick to the price points, and usually, when you have to move away from a price point, the elasticity effect shows quite considerably in your volumes. And so the game is played slightly different there.
So I hope that explains a little bit the 2 ways that we manage elasticity. But I would say in North America and Europe, in general, the way we're doing it, and as you probably heard in previous discussions, our price movements are bigger than previous year but not massive. And that's thanks to that RGM approach, I would say. We are able to deal with the elasticity that comes from it, and an example is a 4% plus volume growth we've seen in this quarter.
As it relates to acquisitions, acquisitions that we've done so far have added about $1.5 billion to our top line. The idea is that they grow high single digits, and so you can probably calculate what they add to our top line growth. I would say it's probably in the order of 0.3% growth. Our plan is to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. It's difficult to say how much and when and at which growth rate. But in general, when we announced our strategy, we always said that we were counting on a 3% plus organic growth, and then we would complement that with growth through acquisition. In that thinking, we were thinking that about 0.5, 0.6 of growth would come eventually from acquisitions. So that's more or less what we have in mind.
We haven't done that many acquisitions yet, and it will probably still take us a few years before we got a significant math that would lead to that 0.5, 0.6. But that's sort of our thinking as it relates to the contribution of acquisition."

Q3 marked another quarter of high-quality top line growth for our business. This result was marked by a continuation of the solid volume growth that we are used to as well as higher contribution from pricing as we successfully executed pricing actions in multiple markets in light of the inflationary environment. 
Demand for our categories remains very strong across both developed and emerging markets. And within those categories, our market share remains higher than pre-COVID as a result of strength in execution, activation and innovation. 
As you know, like the rest of the industry, we are currently operating in a very dynamic environment that poses multiple challenges. These include input cost inflation globally as well as labor and truck shortages in markets like U.S. and the U.K. We are taking the appropriate actions to navigate this, including further rounds of pricing and cost control. You will hear more on this in a moment from both myself and Luca later in the call. 
Despite the current operating environment, we remain focused on and confident in our long-term strategy of delivering accelerated growth through a virtuous top line-driven cycle, which requires continuous investment in our brands and our capabilities. 
Let me turn to Slide 5 and the consumer. During Q3, consumer confidence stabilized in general, with a notable callout of improved confidence in Western Europe, India and much of Latin America as consumers are now more optimistic about job prospects and personal finances in those geographies. Mobility continues to rise, which provides a boost to gum and candy as well as the travel retail channel, but both are expected to remain below pre-COVID levels at least through 2022. 
Ongoing uncertainty is fueling the desire for comfort and indulgence, which has been a consistent trend throughout COVID and, of course, this is benefiting trusted brands like ours. All of this means that our core categories are growing faster than they were pre-COVID and that our portfolio, which skews towards in-home consumption, is benefiting. 
Demand is strong in developed markets, but especially so in emerging markets, notwithstanding a few smaller markets like Vietnam, which are suffering from continued COVID lockdowns. On top of all this, we have gained share during the COVID period. The elevated demand for our categories is contributing to price elasticity below historical levels. Consumers are willing to pay more for essentials or affordable treats as they spend less on eating and drinking outside the home. 
Let me spend a moment on the current operating environment on Slide 6. Like other companies, we are experiencing cost inflation globally, particularly on transportation costs and packaging, which are most pronounced in the U.S. Costs have moved higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half, and we expect inflation to persist in 2022. 
There is also an element of volatility in the supply chain due to labor shortages at third parties combined with a significant gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity and containers in places like U.S. and the U.K. In addition, there are energy shortages in China as demand has outstripped the supply of electricity in many areas. And as you might be aware, we also had a strike at 3 of our plants and 3 distribution centers in the U.S. The strike is now resolved but impacted our production output in the quarter. The good news is that the new contracts give us flexibility and unlock additional capacity to support our growth ambition. 
COVID-19 continues to cause disruption in certain geographies. This was felt most acutely in Q3 in Southeast Asia and resulted in a temporary closure of our factory in Vietnam, for example. Although challenging, we are managing through all these dynamics. We believe we are well equipped to continue to deliver against our objectives, given the strength of our brands, our continued investments, pricing as necessary and our focus on execution. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle, and the results support our ability to consistently deliver profitable volume-driven growth, pricing as needed and return of capital to our shareholders. 
We grew revenue by 5.5% in the quarter and 5% -- sorry, 5.1% year-to-date, lapping 3.9% growth in the first 3 quarters of 2020. Gross profit growth was impacted by cost inflation and supply chain volatility in Q3, but continues to be well over 4% year-to-date, which we consider to be a very healthy indicator of our ability to deliver the high single-digit adjusted EPS growth that is part of our 2021 outlook and our long-term financial algorithm. 
Our year-to-date working media investments have increased double-digit versus last year. And combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and our execution and activation capabilities mean that on a 2-year cumulative basis, we are gaining or holding share across 75% of our revenue year-to-date. And in terms of cash generation and capital return, we increased our year-to-date free cash flow by approximately $400 million versus last year, and we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders. 
Adding the Q3 revenue growth to our track record of performance since launching our strategy in late 2018, you can see on Slide 8 that we are now averaging a 4.1% quarterly growth rate. And we believe we can consistently grow in line or in excess of our long-term algorithm of 3% plus based on the long runway of growth opportunities we show on Slide 9 and the advantaged enablers we have to realize them. These enablers include, for instance, increased brand investment, higher-quality and purpose-led marketing and pricing when necessary. 
This quarter, we continued to make progress against our key growth drivers. These include continuing on our journey to grow Oreo by $1 billion by the end of 2023, with activations like Oreo Pokemon, which became our fastest-selling addition of all time in the U.S., surpassing the previous record set by Game of Thrones and Lady Gaga Oreos. This also includes expanding our presence in key channels like digital commerce, which grew 25% this quarter on a reported basis, lapping 80% of growth in the previous year and also in emerging markets where we continue to gain distribution in places like China and India with another 120,000 and 80,000 stores added this quarter. And finally, this includes increasing our exposure to high-growth segments where we are underrepresented. For example, well-being, where we announced breakthrough innovation this quarter on our largest brands with the Cadbury Plant Bar in the U.K., which is suitable for vegans, and our Oreo Zero Sugar in China, which has the clear potential to expand to other geographies. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let me update you on our sustainability journey. Climate change is a critical issue facing our planet, and we must do our part to help. We also know that if we want to deliver consistent long-term growth and shareholder returns, we must be a sustainable snacking company. For those reasons, we recently announced that we will take the necessary actions that we believe will allow us to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This is a major target that applies to all greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This target also sees us join the United Nations Race to Zero campaign as well as the Science Based Targets initiative, business ambition for 1.5 degrees where we are strengthening our position from our previous commitment of well below 2 degrees. 
We plan to deliver net zero by focusing on the highest contributors to our carbon footprint. In our case, there are raw materials, which contribute 71% of our emissions. We will amplify our existing programs like Cocoa Life and Harmony Wheat in support of this, and we will focus on leveraging emerging low-carbon technology at our owned operations. 
Alongside working towards net zero emissions, we will continue to advance all other pillars of our ESG agenda, including sustainable ingredient sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and net zero packaging. We are excited to continue our journey to build a sustainable snacking company. 
With our proven strategy, our preferred brands, our executional excellence, our compounding investments and our enhanced ESG agenda, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver strong performance for years to come. 
With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials."

Our third quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered top line strength, good operating profit dollar growth, including significant brand reinvestment and excellent free cash flow. Revenue grew 5.",1657,"Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. 
Our third quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered top line strength, good operating profit dollar growth, including significant brand reinvestment and excellent free cash flow. 
Revenue grew 5.5%, underpinned by solid volume growth and pricing that we have been implementing to counter unprecedented cost inflation. Emerging markets continued with accelerated growth, displaying the resilience of our categories and strong execution. They grew more than 12% for the quarter and nearly 9% on a 2-year basis. Our emerging markets results include double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico and India as well as high single-digit growth in China, Russia and Africa. 
These markets are attractive growth engines for us. As consumer purchasing power continues to grow, as we fill white spaces, as we pursue distribution expansion and as consumers trade up, we continue to invest behind them in a big way. 
For the quarter, developed markets growth remained solid at 2% with a 2-year average growth of 3%. Demand and consumption trends are robust in this market, albeit supply chain restrictions limited our growth, specifically in North America. 
Turning to Slide 13 and portfolio performance. Biscuits grew 2.7% and more than 5% on a 2-year average. Brazil, Russia and Mexico posted double-digit growth, while India and China grew mid-single digits. Oreo continues to be a standout performer. Chocolate grew more than 11% with a 2-year average of more than 8%. India, Brazil and France grew double digits. The U.K. grew high single digits, and Russia grew mid-single digits. Cadbury, Milka and Lacta all delivered robust volume-led growth for the quarter. Gum & Candy posted double-digit growth, resulting from a continued improvement in mobility. 
Moving to market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance. On a 2-year cumulative basis, we have held or gained share in 75% of the business. Biscuits and chocolate held or gained in 80% of our revenue base. Notable share gainers on a 2-year basis include the U.S., China, Russia and Brazil biscuits and U.K., Australia, Russia and South Africa chocolate. Gum & Candy had gain in 30% of our revenue base, primarily due to game performance in China, Russia and France. Although still below pre-COVID levels, this category continues to improve with mobility trends. 
Moving to Page 15. Gross profit dollar grew 2% for the quarter. reflecting the acute impact of elevated inflation in commodities as well as transportation and labor costs in North America. While all other regions still face some inflation, they all display GP dollar growth in line with our expectations. 
In the short term, we have adopted our promo and trade deal spending to the elevated cost environment. But as we expect these dynamics to persist into 2022, we have also taken and announced price increases across a significant number of markets. Of note, we announced a new round of pricing last month in the U.S., which will go into effect at the start of next year. Although cost pressures are not as high as in the U.S., we also have a robust pricing agenda for other markets, too. We have implemented pricing in Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia in addition to other business units. Our goal remains to enter 2022 with improved dollar profitability levels from this action to support the virtuous cycle, which funds continuous investment. 
Operating income dollars increased 4.5% due to strong overhead management and simplification initiatives. We continue to invest in A&C, which was up almost double digits in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, gross margin has increased nearly 5%, while operating income dollars have grown by more than 8%. A&C has increased double digits. 
Moving to regional results on Slide 16. Europe revenue grew 4.6% in the quarter and 4% on a 2-year basis. OI dollars grew 5 -- 4.5% versus last year, reflecting a strong virtuous cycle. North America grew 0.3% on top of 6.3% growth last year. resulting in a 2-year average growth of 3.3%. Operating income declined 9.7% in the quarter. Overall, North America results were negatively impacted by service level constraints in the U.S. as transportation and labor shortages have impacted both cost and sales. These constraints are primarily impacting our external manufacturing and third-party logistics partners. We expect profit dollar growth to improve in conjunction with recently announced price increases across much of our U.S. portfolio that go into effect as of January 1 next year. For the quarter, the impact of the 6-week U.S. strike was mitigated by a business continuity plan, which included increasing inventory levels [ held ]. Nevertheless, there will be an impact in Q4, which I will discuss in our outlook. 
AMEA posted growth of 5.7% and a 2-year average of 4.9%, with broad-based trends apart from Southeast Asia, where COVID-related restrictions did impact our Q3. India delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, and China delivered high single-digit growth. AMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 8%, while continuing to make sizable working media and route-to-market investments. 
Latin America grew 26% in Q3 and 14% on a 2-year average. Brazil and Mexico both grew double digits, while dollars in Latin America grew double digits over prior year due to pricing and volume growth. 
Now turning to EPS on Slide 17. Q3 EPS increased 9.4% at constant currency driven primarily by operating gains with year-to-date EPS increase of nearly 9%. 
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the third quarter, bringing us to $2.1 billion on a year-to-date basis. We also repurchased approximately $1.8 billion in shares in the first 3 quarters at attractive prices. 
I wanted to spend a quick moment on some of the significant improvements in our debt structure, financing costs and pension costs on Slide 19. Since 2014, interest expense has been reduced by approximately 60% despite an increase in total borrowings with a current average rate of 1.7%. At the same time, we have extended our maturity from 7.7 years to 9.6 years. Similarly, pension funding has improved significantly in the recent years to 99%, driving material reductions in pension contribution requirements and costs. 
And in September, we issued our first green bond, which was the largest today in the CPG structure, enabling us to cost effectively fund our sustainability initiatives around local packaging and our net zero carbon targets. 
Let me spend a moment on Slide 21 regarding the current cost and supply chain environment and our actions. The supply chain environment remains a challenge for us, like many others, with higher cost inflation as well as labor shortages at the third parties and strained transportation capacity. We have a well-established playbook to mitigate the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures over time. This includes successful implementation of price increases as part of our RGM strategy, supported by the strength of our brands. 
We're also continuing in our journey of portfolio simplification to identify additional SKU reduction opportunities and to improve service levels and overall efficiency. In terms of our manufacturing network, we are taking actions to free up capacity with more flexibility in some of our plants and logistics networks. 
We also continue to execute our hedging programs of key commodities, which we believe have been effective, as you can tell by looking at our realized and unrealized mark-to-market gains this year. Overall, we are confident that these initiatives will allow us to offset the majority of the pressures we are currently seeing and will drive long-term profit dollar growth, albeit with some lumpiness given the cadence of pricing and input cost increase. 
Moving to our outlook on Slide 22. We expect most of the trends that we have experienced in Q3 to expand into Q4, including robust demand for our categories and brands in both developed and emerging markets; continued transportation and labor inflation and supply chain pressure in our North American region; increased focus on revenue growth management activities across a wider span of businesses; high level of reinvestment in our people, brands, markets and capabilities. 
Based on our strong results year-to-date, continued categories resilience and solid demand trends, we are raising our full year revenue growth outlook to approximately 4.5%. This implies Q4 growth of 3% or nearly 4.5% on a 2-year CAGR and assumes approximately a 1 point of top line headwind from the impact of the transportation and logistic constraints and the recent strike in the U.S. As the in-market conditions remain fluid, this outlook does not reflect a material worsening from current environment. 
In terms of EPS, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year despite the initial pressure from commodities and transportation and labor dynamics in North America. We also expect free cash flow generation of $3 billion plus. ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.09 on the year based on current market rates. 
One note related to our simplified [indiscernible] restructuring plan. We have expanded the program by 1 year as we are still left with about $100 million of available funds that we plan to spend on high-return supply chain and overhead-related projects. The overall amount of the restructuring program is unchanged, so this does not change anything else in our outlook for this and next year. 
Our updated outlook is based on current conditions and does not factor a material degradation in the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID supply chain restrictions. 
To wrap up, we are encouraged by the trajectory of demand for our brands and categories across our geographies. We are confident in our growth strategy and our ability to continue to execute against it going forward. This means balanced and consistent top and bottom line growth, continued reinvestment in our business, disciplined cost management and strong free cash flow generation.

I'll start and then I can hand it over to Luca. Well, if I look first at emerging markets, they continue to be a major growth engine for us. In Q3, they grew double digit. Year-to-date, they're growing double digit. They're high singl",575,"Thank you, Andrew. I'll start and then I can hand it over to Luca. 
Well, if I look first at emerging markets, they continue to be a major growth engine for us. In Q3, they grew double digit. Year-to-date, they're growing double digit. They're high single digit on a 2-year CAGR, so very strong volume growth, good pricing. And linking that to the consumer, I think what we're seeing is that the consumer confidence is improving in markets like India, big parts of Latin America. They are seeing the vaccine rollout. They're seeing life going back to normal. They feel better about their personal finances, and that is reflected in their consumption. At the same time, they still spend more time at home, which benefits our categories. 
Particularly, the BRIC countries are very strong with a very strong double-digit growth in India and Brazil and high single-digit growth in China and Russia. The execution there in those 4 countries has been excellent this quarter. 
But at the same time, looking in Africa, Poland, Pakistan, Mexico, they're all growing well. The only places in the emerging markets where we see some disruption is in some smaller markets, particularly Southeast Asia, where the COVID cases were quite severe, and there was serious restrictions. We talked about our plant in Vietnam being closed for 3 weeks. And so that has had an effect on Q3, but hopefully, that will be temporary. 
On developed markets, what I would say demand is strong but it's a challenging operating environment, particularly in the U.S. So we had big consumption spikes in 2020, particularly in the U.S. But so far, we are up 2% in revenue in Q3 and just over 1% year-to-date, lapping a very strong last year. 
But if you look at a 2-year CAGR, it's over 3%. That is well above where we were in 2019, where we were growing about 2% in developed markets. And we see the consumers behavior where the consumer on average is spending 15% more time at home than before the pandemic that is clearly benefiting our categories and our portfolio. 
Looking particularly or specifically at North America, it's growing well on a 2-year CAGR, almost 4%, but declining slightly year-to-date versus last year. But again, 2020 was an extremely strong year for North America. The demand remains very robust in biscuits, but the service challenges in the second half due to pressures on the logistic capacity, third-party labor and the strike, which is now resolved, had an impact in Q3 and will continue to have an impact in Q4. 
Europe, we're seeing a very solid quarter, very solid year-to-date. The demand for our core categories is robust. We've got very strong year-to-date revenue growth for the U.K., for Germany, the Nordics. And mass retail, which is lapping strong growth last year, is still very good. And then, of course, we're benefiting from the recovery in convenience and travel retail as the consumer is regaining mobility. 
Maybe the other thing that I would say that we are in an inflationary environment. We've been increasing prices, and we plan to increase the prices more than we've done at least in the time that I'm here and probably for quite a while as a company. But what is good is that the elasticity levels are below historic levels and almost nothing to speak of. So that is helping the overall performance. 
Maybe over to you, Luca."

And as far as revenue goes, I would simply say the business is fundamentally in a good place. You might have seen in the pages that we presented that chocolate and biscuit categories are vibrant. On a 2-year stack, our share gains are very good. And you might also have noticed that pricing contribution is increasing, as you would expect given the cost pressures we are facing, but also that volume is holding up quite well. 
We can also say that virtually all international businesses are positioned very well for both Q4 and 2022. However, in North America, obviously, the 6-week strike predominantly but also the volatility that Dirk mentioned is putting some pressure on our supply chain, and that will impact the Q4 performance in a context where the market is fairly positive and demand is quite good. So we estimated, mostly because of the strike impact in Q4, that there will be a 1 point of revenue pressure for the whole of Mondelez. 
So to sum it up, Q4 is still going to be a good quarter, I believe, in terms of revenue, when considering that there is the onetime strike impact. And at this point, we feel quite good about top line and its momentum into 2022. 
From a profitability standpoint, we also feel good about the full year profit outlook. In the end, I think you know that year-to-date GP dollar is up by 5%, EBIT by 8% and all in a context where we are increasing A&C double digit with overhead flat. And I feel comfortable with our EPS high single digit guidance for 2021. 
Having said that, I have to recognize that there is some GP pressure in Q3, and that will persist into Q4 and partly into 2022. The pressure is due to commodity transportation costs and compounded quite frankly, by some industry-wide supply chain constraints. 
North America is driving most of the pressure in the GP line in the quarter, and it is, in fact, the only region that declined GP dollars versus last year. With the other regions, all above or close to our goal of 4% GP growth year-on-year. 
We are taking the appropriate actions to counter those cost spikes. We had recently announced a 6% to 7% price lease increase in the U.S., which will take effect in 2022, January. We have also announced pricing in Q4 in Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa and across Western Europe. We are leveraging our GM, as we said many times, also going after productivity and general cost measures. So we expect a sequential improvement versus previous years in the following quarters as more pricing kicks in. 
So at this point, we believe that our 2022 EBIT growth will be solid through volume mix, pricing, obviously, productivity and are still contemplating meaningful A&C increases at this point. So 2022 from an EBIT standpoint should be on algorithm based on what we know today. Let's stay tuned because, obviously, Q1 will be a little bit more pressure, and we will provide more clear and comprehensive guidance in the next earnings cycle for 2022."

In the end, we are more focused on actuals than long-term algorithms. And by executing well, obviously, we aim at being closer to a number that is with 4 than with 3. And so that's really the rationale behind the long-term algorithm. 
If there are some catalysts, namely some portfolio changes and more acquisitions I think that will be the good opportunity for us to revisit the algorithm and declare formally that we aim at something higher than 3% plus. But I think you're right, in the end, the track record we have speaks for itself. We have been steadily delivering higher growth, and we plan to do so also going forward."

So historically, our global brands have been growing faster than local jewels, but we have been accelerating the growth of our local jewels and largely through renovations and activations. 2020 was different. There, our local jewels grew faster than our global brands because a number of our global brands were impacted by COVID-related changes in consumer behavior. So Toblerone, for instance, because of travel retail, declined. Halls, sorry, because there was very limited cough and cold season, and then Trident because the gum category was impacted by reduced mobility. 
If you then look at 2021 -- year-to-date 2021, global brands are now growing faster again than local jewels, but both are growing very strongly. Both are in the mid-single-digit group. And we're very happy with where our local brands are at this moment from flat to declining a few years ago, they're now, as I said, mid-single digit. We continue to step up brand investments year-over-year, and we're going to continue to activate more local jewels over time. So we think we found the ideal balance, and we continue to keep on going as we are."

And then, Dirk,  just your perspective on the incremental rounds of pricing that you're taking to offset inflation. And I guess how it will be different this time? 
I think if we go back prior to your coming to Mondelez, one of the issues was that there was quite a bit of pricing taken over time to protect or build margins, and it definitely had an impact on volume, on demand. I mean it's a big part of what you came in to address and change in time you've been at Mondelez. 
So maybe you could just kind of talk about how you've thought about that dynamic this time around and how it will be different, maybe the way you're approaching pricing. Or just what's different about the ability to have some pricing power this time versus the last time Mondelez really tried to lean into pricing to protect or build margins."

I mean as a principle, what we're trying to do is the mixture between volume growth, pricing and mix needs to offset the inflation. That's how we think about it. And then on top of that, we have a whole productivity program, which we use to increase our margins. So it's different from the past in the sense that we are not as aggressive on pricing. We're not trying to build extra margin because of pricing. We're trying, through the mixture of those 3 things, maintain it as it is. And then the extra comes from the productivity programs. 
The other big difference versus the past is that we continue to increase year-over-year, our investment in our brands. First of all, our overall A&C pop, but then also how much we're shifting within A&C into working media. So the worst you can do, I think, is increase prices and not increase your support for your brand. So we've been supporting our brands now every year more and more. Our media pressure has significantly increased versus 3, 4 years ago. We can see that the brand health is increasing. So I think our brands are now more susceptible to pricing and the consumer should accept it better. Those are the 2 big differences, Bryan, versus what it was a few years ago."

We also are using what we call RGM, revenue growth management, which is a mixture of different techniques, if I can call it like that. And it's not always a straightforward price increase. 
If I look at the consumer, I think the main thing that had worked here is that consumer confidence is stabilizing, mobility's on the rise. They have an ongoing desire for comfort so they want a snack, and they're spending more time at home. All that gives a very strong demand for our categories. 
Our categories are growing more like 4% around the world versus the 3% that we usually planned for. And so I think that is leading the consumer to almost have no elasticity at the moment. And we hope or we think that, that will remain quite a while. And so I think we don't want to do that in our planning for next year, but we do believe that there might be better elasticity than what we're planning for at the moment."

From a cost standpoint, we have mitigated the cost impact. Obviously, all the puts and takes are slightly negative, but they are not meaningful on the total P&L profile for Q4. Clearly, some demand pressure -- some supply pressure will put a little bit of a cost strain on the value chain, and we will have a little bit of under-absorption kicking in, in the P&L in Q4.

Did something change? Did you get better visibility into how you might achieve that goal?

So Alexia, the simple answer is we had locked in, particularly on promotional activities also given obviously, some internal dynamics to our company, which we discussed. 
We had locked in promotional windows and promotional activities well before Q2. And that bound us with our customers to a certain promo windows and certain promo activities. And we thought that rather than disrupting even further the supply chain our preference was really to go for a full 100% price increase as of January 1. So there might be a couple of quarters of a dislocation. But I think, all in all, considering all the effects that we had internal and external, it was better for us to go in effect with pricing as of Q1 next year. 
Obviously, we will be extremely nimble here. We still don't know to what extent logistics cost will spike during the Christmas season and the holiday season in the U.S. So if we see continuous cost pressure, at this point, we cannot rule out additional pricing waves.

It's really an acceleration and an extension of our exiting initiative applies to all our greenhouse grasses and the full supply chain, so Scope 1, 2 and 3. And with this, we are joining the UN Race to Zero and SBTi business ambition for 1.5-degree Celsius. 
If you look at our footprint, 71% of our footprint is coming from ingredients. And so the 3 big areas we need to work on is those ingredients, it's our own operations and it's our logistics. And if you think about it, in ingredients, that means that we need to continue and increase our investment in Cocoa Life. That's one of the big factors. We have a wheat program related to regenerative agriculture. We need to extend that. We need to make sure that our whole packaging approach is clear on recyclable but also working on the recyclability and the use of virgin plastic over the years. We needed to get into our operations, understand renewable electricity. We need to reduce food waste, which we've done quite significantly, but we need to do more 15% in our own operations, 50% in our distribution, for instance. We need to change all our ovens, we need to change all our boilers and so on and so on. And then in logistics, we need to switch to electric vehicles, hydrogen trucks, work on our warehouse emissions and change the efficiency of our networks, just to name a few things of what this means. 
So the team has worked through all these details, and they've come up with a plan that is credible. It's not easy. We've also made a 10-year plan for the company, Vision 2030, which during 2022, we're planning an Investor Day around that and all the costs of net zero have been built into that plan, which is another thing that we wanted to make sure of that we have the costs clear. So that's why you felt in the past months, we were a little bit sort of hesitant because we were working through this exercise, and I really didn't know is this going to all add up? And is it a plan that we can really believe in. But I think we've come up with something strong that the company feels that we can deliver. It's not going to be easy, but that's why we can make the announcement right now."

As I said, in the end, when I look at really GP growth across the board for our regions, I feel quite good about what was accomplished across the European business, the AMEA business and the Latin American business. The pressure came really from North America entities, quite frankly, mostly attributable to the logistics and transportation cost constraints that we have seen. 
We also have to acknowledge though that particularly around some commodities like edible oils, et cetera, there has been some pressure. So I would say the GP line pressure comes in Q4, mostly because of the commodity and logistics costs, and it is mostly attributable to the North American business. And so as you think going forward, pricing should really improve margins because I believe the cost severity in Q3 is quite high, it might go a little bit further in Q4 and into next year. but we cannot escalate proportionately the same amount as we have seen in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 and into 2022. So that's a little bit of color around the GP line."

Look, I think you know how big North America is in total for the company, and you have a sense of what a 6%, 7% price increase would do. So I think your math is in a ballpark right. Obviously, the question is how is volume going to react? And what we are seeing at the moment, it is that elasticities are more benign than they have been historically, but we need to see protracted price increases into next year and we need to see what -- moving away from some price anchors will do to our consumers and that's a little bit the question mark at this point. As I said, though, the totality of the company at this time, I see good revenue momentum going into '22, and I see revenue being an algorithm for next year as well."

But on gum, roughly, I would say, some drop to about 65% to 70% last year of what was in 2019 because of mobility. I think for the total of '21, it's going to be roughly around 85%, maybe 90% of where it was in 2019, and then we expect that it will close that gap in 2022. 
Now in the beginning of the year, the recuperation was slower. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of the recuperation of gum. So we're talking about double-digit revenue year-to-date growth of come and strong double-digit revenue growth in Q3. So year-to-date, on a 2-year CAGR, we're still negative high single digit. But as I said, the recovery is going faster. And then we're starting to see some markets, particularly China and Russia, where we now have a positive 2-year CAGR on gum. 
The emerging markets remain attractive for us, and the question is really on the developed markets, which is only 2% of our 2020 net revenue. And so that's really where we expect the recovery to be slowest. 
As it relates to World Travel Retail, that dropped almost to 0, I would say. It was probably at 5% of what it was before the pandemic. This year, we will probably get back to, depending a little bit what happens at the end of the year, with travel, but maybe 65%, 70%. And then depending on what consumers decide to do as it relates to travel, that's the big unknown, we will, for sure, go up significantly next year, but I'm not quite sure that we will see the same amount of travel and as a consequence, buying on travel as we saw in 2019. So that's still a little bit up in the air. but we will get close to -- I think gum will be all the way back. But remember, gum was growing a lot in 2019. So back but no significant growth, and World Travel Retail closed, but not completely, we think."

But in general, we believe that we want to outgrow our categories. And to outgrow our categories our brands need to have more visibility, more support, more innovation than others. We believe that, that can be achieved with roughly, I would say, a 7% to 8% increase year-over-year of our A&C investment. And that fits into our long-term algorithm where our expectation is that half of the -- of the 4% plus growth that we want in gross profit year after year, that half of that gets reinvested. Not all of that goes into A&C, some goes into overheads, a part goes into R&D. But overall, that's the thinking, and that allows for that roughly 7% to 8% increase. So it fits into the long-term algorithm. 
As it relates to pricing and increasing our investments, we're trying to maintain our algorithm. If we see we can get a better top line, we might do more flowing -- continuously flowing at 50% back into investment. This year, as an example, we have a double-digit increase in our A&C year-to-date. While we are doing the price increases that Luca talked about. Then the other movement that we're doing is within the A&C investment, we are moving more of the investment in working media. We've done that now for multiple years. So the investments are really compounding. There is an increase in overall A&C and then the increase in working media within A&C. And then we have also made big strides on the quality, the effectiveness and the ROI of our marketing. 
If you talk about where do you want to do more we have our local jewels, which we have given significantly more investment in the last 3 years, but we want to continue to do that more on the brands that we're already supporting and activate more brands. And then as it relates to markets where we would do that, probably the -- some of the markets where we are underrepresented, largely emerging markets, that's where we think we should do the biggest increases of our A&C because we still have the category to support and really build the category for the longer term. That's how we're thinking about it. 
Not sure, Luca, if you want to add something?"

And particularly on the work in media, we have been improving quite a bit the situation about what we spend in that P&L line. And I would also say the quality of advertising and the mix of advertising is helping us improving the ROI quite a bit. And so I think that's one of the things that has made the model more sustainable for us. And I think when you look at volume growth, share gains, there is a strong linkage with these investments we have been making in global and local brands."

The white space opportunities for us are -- I mean, if you look at our building blocks for growth, the first 2 are pretty straightforward. It's make sure our categories keep on growing. We are big players in our category. Our category growth depends partly of us. Second, continue to increase our market share, and that gives us a bigger growth. 
Third, there is the channel expansion that we can do. We are not having the same market share in all channels, thinking about, for instance, online or digital commerce in the more developed markets, but we're also talking about numerical distribution in emerging markets, as I was saying in the prepared remarks. We're increasing China by 120,000 stores, in India by 80,000 stores are present this quarter alone. So then on top of that, there's high growth segments within our categories. And so I'm thinking about well-being, thinking about premium. And those are some of the areas that we are underrepresented and that we  should be really launching new products in there and using some of the acquisitions that we've been seeing to get in there. For instance, Grenade or Hu would fit in this category. 
Then we have geographic white spaces around the world, countries where we are not yet that present. And so we haven't done that many yet, although an acquisition like Chipita, which largely plays in East and Central Europe and some of the other emerging markets, obviously, we'll reinforce our presence, but they're largely in the same countries as we are or where we already have a smaller presence, but they certainly will give us more critical mass. 
And then the last one is the close-in adjacencies, which are the bakery and the bar segment. And so Chipita or Give & Go fully fall into that sort of growth opportunity that we have. And so that's the last white space. So it's between channel, high-growth segments, geographical white spaces and close-in adjacencies. Those are the 4 big white spaces that we have."

These include input cost inflation globally as well as labor and truck shortages in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. We are taking the appropriate actions to navigate this, including further rounds of pricing and cost control. You will hear more on this in a moment from both myself and Luca later in the call.
Despite the current operating environment, we remain focused on and confident in our long-term strategy of delivering accelerated growth through a virtuous top line-driven cycle, which requires continuous investment in our brands and our capabilities.
Let me turn to Slide 5 and the consumer. During Q3, consumer confidence stabilized in general, with a notable callout of improved confidence in Western Europe, India and much of Latin America as consumers are now more optimistic about job prospects and personal finances in those geographies. Mobility continues to rise, which provides a boost to Gum & Candy as well as the travel retail channel, but both are expected to remain below pre-COVID levels at least through 2022.
Ongoing uncertainty is fueling the desire for comfort and indulgence, which has been a consistent trend throughout COVID. And of course, this is benefiting trusted brands like ours. All of this means that our core categories are growing faster than they were pre-COVID and that our portfolio, which skews towards in-home consumption, is benefiting.
Demand is strong in developed markets but especially so in emerging markets, notwithstanding a few smaller markets like Vietnam, which are suffering from continued COVID lockdowns. On top of all this, we have gained share during the COVID period. The elevated demand for our categories is contributing to price elasticity below historical levels. Consumers are willing to pay more for essentials or affordable treats as they spend less on eating and drinking outside the home.
Let me spend a moment on the current operating environment on Slide 6. Like other companies, we are experiencing cost inflation globally, particularly on transportation costs and packaging, which are most pronounced in the U.S. Costs have moved higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half, and we expect inflation to persist in 2022. There is also an element of volatility in the supply chain due to labor shortages at third parties combined with a significant gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity and containers in places like the U.S. and the U.K. 
In addition, there are energy shortages in China as demand has outstripped the supply of electricity in many areas. And as you might be aware, we also had a strike at 3 of our plants and 3 distribution centers in the U.S. The strike is now resolved but impacted our production output in the quarter. The good news is that the new contracts give us flexibility and unlock additional capacity to support our growth ambition.
COVID-19 continues to cause disruption in certain geographies. This was felt most acutely in Q3 in Southeast Asia and resulted in a temporary closure of our factory in Vietnam, for example. Although challenging, we are managing through all these dynamics. We believe we are well equipped to continue to deliver against our objectives given the strength of our brands, our continued investments, pricing as necessary and our focus on execution.
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle, and the results support our ability to consistently deliver profitable volume-driven growth, pricing as needed and return of capital to our shareholders.
We grew revenue by 5.5% in the quarter and 5% -- sorry, 5.1% year-to-date, lapping 3.9% growth in the first 3 quarters of 2020. Gross profit growth was impacted by cost inflation and supply chain volatility in Q3 but continues to be well over 4% year-to-date, which we consider to be a very healthy indicator of our ability to deliver the high single-digit adjusted EPS growth that is part of our 2021 outlook and our long-term financial algorithm.
Our year-to-date working media investments have increased double digit versus last year and, combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and our execution and activation capabilities, mean that on a 2-year cumulative basis, we are gaining or holding share across 75% of our revenue year-to-date. And in terms of cash generation and capital return, we increased our year-to-date free cash flow by approximately $400 million versus last year, and we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders.
Adding the Q3 revenue growth to our track record of performance since launching our strategy in late 2018, you can see on Slide 8 that we are now averaging a 4.1% quarterly growth rate. And we believe we can consistently grow in line or in excess of our long-term algorithm of 3% plus based on the long runway of growth opportunities we show on Slide 9 and the advantaged enablers we have to realize them. These enablers include, for instance, increased brand investment, higher-quality and purpose-led marketing and pricing when necessary.
This quarter, we continued to make progress against our key growth drivers. These include continuing on our journey to grow Oreo by $1 billion by the end of 2023, with activations like Oreo x Pokemon, which became our fastest-selling addition of all time in the U.S., surpassing the previous record set by Game of Thrones and Lady Gaga Oreos. This also includes expanding our presence in key channels like digital commerce, which grew 25% this quarter on a reported basis, lapping 80% of growth in the previous year; and also in emerging markets where we continue to gain distribution in places like China and India with another 120,000 and 80,000 stores added this quarter. 
And finally, this includes increasing our exposure to high-growth segments where we are underrepresented, for example, well-being, where we announced breakthrough innovation this quarter on our largest brands with the Cadbury Plant Bar in the U.K., which is suitable for vegans; and our Oreo Zero Sugar in China, which has the clear potential to expand to other geographies.
Turning to Slide 10. Let me update you on our sustainability journey. Climate change is a critical issue facing our planet, and we must do our part to help. We also know that if we want to deliver consistent long-term growth and shareholder returns, we must be a sustainable snacking company. For those reasons, we recently announced that we will take the necessary actions that we believe will allow us to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. This is a major target that applies to all greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This target also sees us join the United Nations Race to Zero campaign as well as the Science Based Targets initiative, business ambition for 1.5 degrees, where we are strengthening our position from our previous commitment of well below 2 degrees.
We plan to deliver net 0 by focusing on the highest contributors to our carbon footprint. In our case, there are raw materials, which contribute 71% of our emissions. We will amplify our existing programs like Cocoa Life and Harmony Wheat in support of this, and we will focus on leveraging emerging low-carbon technology at our owned operations.
Alongside working towards net 0 emissions, we will continue to advance all other pillars of our ESG agenda, including sustainable ingredient sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and net 0 packaging. We are excited to continue our journey to build a sustainable snacking company.
With our proven strategy, our preferred brands, our executional excellence, our compounding investments and our enhanced ESG agenda, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver strong performance for years to come.
With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials."

Our third quarter performance was strong across the board.

Our third quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered top line strength, good operating profit dollar growth, including significant brand reinvestment, and excellent free cash flow.
Revenue grew 5.5%, underpinned by solid volume growth and pricing that we have been implementing to counter unprecedented cost inflation. Emerging markets continued with accelerated growth, displaying the resilience of our categories and strong execution. They grew more than 12% for the quarter and nearly 9% on a 2-year basis. Our emerging markets results include double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico and India as well as high single-digit growth in China, Russia and Africa. These markets are attractive growth engines for us. As consumer purchasing power continues to grow, as we fill white spaces, as we pursue distribution expansion and as consumers trade up, we continue to invest behind them in a big way.
For the quarter, developed markets growth remained solid at 2%, with a 2-year average growth of 3%. Demand and consumption trends are robust in this market, albeit supply chain restrictions limited our growth, specifically in North America.
Turning to Slide 13 and portfolio performance. Biscuits grew 2.7% and more than 5% on a 2-year average. Brazil, Russia and Mexico posted double-digit growth, while India and China grew mid-single digits. Oreo continues to be a standout performer. Chocolate grew more than 11% with a 2-year average of more than 8%. India, Brazil and France grew double digits. The U.K. grew high single digits, and Russia grew mid-single digits. Cadbury, Milka and Lacta all delivered robust, volume-led growth for the quarter. Gum & Candy posted double-digit growth, resulting from a continued improvement in mobility.
Moving to market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance. On a 2-year cumulative basis, we have held or gained share in 75% of the business. Biscuits and chocolate held or gained in 80% of our revenue base. Notable share gainers on a 2-year basis include the U.S., China, Russia and Brazil biscuits and U.K., Australia, Russia and South Africa chocolate. Gum & Candy held or gained in 30% of our revenue base, primarily due to gum performance in China, Russia and France. Although still below pre-COVID levels, this category continues to improve with mobility trends.
Moving to Page 15. Gross profit dollar grew 2% for the quarter, reflecting the acute impact of elevated inflation in commodities as well as transportation and labor costs in North America. While all other regions still face some inflation, they all display GP dollars growth in line with our expectations.
In the short term, we have adopted our promo and trade deal spending to the elevated cost environment. But as we expect these dynamics to persist into 2022, we have also taken and announced price increases across a significant number of markets. Of note, we announced a new round of pricing last month in the U.S., which will go into effect at the start of next year. Although cost pressures are not as high as in the U.S., we also have a robust pricing agenda for other markets, too. We have implemented pricing in Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia in addition to other business units. Our goal remains to enter 2022 with improved dollar profitability levels from this action to support the virtuous cycle, which funds continuous investment.
Operating income dollars increased 4.5% due to strong overhead management and simplification initiatives. We continue to invest in A&C, which was up almost double digits in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, gross margin has increased nearly 5%, while operating income dollars have grown by more than 8%. A&C has increased double digits.
Moving to regional results on Slide 16. Europe revenue grew 4.6% in the quarter and 4% on a 2-year basis. OI dollars grew 5 -- 4.5% versus last year, reflecting a strong virtuous cycle. 
North America grew 0.3% on top of 6.3% growth last year, resulting in a 2-year average growth of 3.3%. Operating income declined 9.7% in the quarter. Overall, North America results were negatively impacted by service-level constraints in the U.S. as transportation and labor shortages have impacted both cost and sales. These constraints are primarily impacting our external manufacturing and third-party logistics partners. We expect profit dollar growth to improve in conjunction with recently announced price increases across much of our U.S. portfolio that go into effect as of January 1 next year. For the quarter, the impact of the 6-week U.S. strike was mitigated by a business continuity plan, which included increasing inventory levels ahead of it. Nevertheless, there will be an impact in Q4, which I will discuss in our outlook.
AMEA posted growth of 5.7% and a 2-year average of 4.9%, with broad-based trends apart from Southeast Asia, where COVID-related restrictions did impact our Q3. India delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, and China delivered high single-digit growth. AMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 8% while continuing to make sizable working media and route-to-market investments.
Latin America grew 26% in Q3 and 14% on a 2-year average. Brazil and Mexico both grew double digits, while dollars in Latin America grew double digits over prior year due to pricing and volume growth.
Now turning to EPS on Slide 17. Q3 EPS increased 9.4% at constant currency driven primarily by operating gains, with year-to-date EPS increase of nearly 9%.
Moving to cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the third quarter, bringing us to $2.1 billion on a year-to-date basis. We also repurchased approximately $1.8 billion in shares in the first 3 quarters at attractive prices.
I wanted to spend a quick moment on some of the significant improvements in our debt structure, financing costs and pension costs on Slide 19. Since 2014, interest expense has been reduced by approximately 60% despite an increase in total borrowings with a current average rate of 1.7%. At the same time, we have extended our maturity from 7.7 years to 9.6 years. Similarly, pension funding has improved significantly in the recent years to 99%, driving material reductions in pension contribution requirements and costs. And in September, we issued our first green bond, which was the largest today in the CPG sector, enabling us to cost effectively fund our sustainability initiatives around cocoa, packaging and our net 0 carbon target.
Let me spend a moment on Slide 21 regarding the current cost and supply chain environment and our actions. The supply chain environment remains a challenge for us, like many others, with higher cost inflation as well as labor shortages at the third parties and strained transportation capacity. We have a well-established playbook to mitigate the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures over time. This includes successful implementation of price increases as part of our RGM strategy, supported by the strength of our brands.
We're also continuing in our journey of portfolio simplification to identify additional SKU reduction opportunities and to improve service levels and overall efficiency. In terms of our manufacturing network, we are taking actions to free up capacity with more flexibility in some of our plants and logistics networks.
We also continue to execute our hedging programs of key commodities, which we believe have been effective, as you can tell by looking at our realized and unrealized mark-to-market gains this year. Overall, we are confident that these initiatives will allow us to offset the majority of the pressures we are currently seeing and will drive long-term profit dollar growth, albeit with some lumpiness given the cadence of pricing and input cost increase.
Moving to our outlook on Slide 22. We expect most of the trends that we have experienced in Q3 to extend into Q4, including robust demand for our categories and brands in both developed and emerging markets, continued transportation and labor inflation and supply chain pressure in our North American region, increased focus on revenue growth management activities across a wider span of businesses, high level of reinvestment in our people, brands, markets and capabilities.
Based on our strong results year-to-date, continued categories resilience and solid demand trends, we are raising our full year revenue growth outlook to approximately 4.5%. This implies Q4 growth of 3% or nearly 4.5% on a 2-year CAGR and assumes approximately a 1 point of top line headwind from the impact of the continued transportation and logistic constraints and the recent strike in the U.S. As the in-market conditions remain fluid, this outlook does not reflect a material worsening from current environment.
In terms of EPS, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year despite the initial pressure from commodities and transportation and labor dynamics in North America. We also expect free cash flow generation of $3 billion plus. ForEx translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.09 on the year based on current market rates.
One note related to our Simplify to Grow restructuring plan. We have expanded the program by 1 year as we are still left with about $100 million of available funds that we plan to spend on high-return supply chain and overhead-related projects. The overall amount of the restructuring program is unchanged, so this does not change anything else in our outlook for this and next year. Our updated outlook is based on current conditions and does not factor a material degradation in the operating environment that could be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID or supply chain restrictions.
To wrap up, we are encouraged by the trajectory of demand for our brands and categories across our geographies. We are confident in our growth strategy and our ability to continue to execute against it going forward. This means balanced and consistent top and bottom line growth, continued reinvestment in our business, disciplined cost management and strong free cash flow generation.
With that, let's open it up for Q&A."

I'll start and then I can hand it over to Luca. Well, if I look first at emerging markets, they continue to be a major growth engine for us. In Q3, they grew double digit.

Well, if I look first at emerging markets, they continue to be a major growth engine for us. In Q3, they grew double digit. Year-to-date, they're growing double digit. They're high single digit on a 2-year CAGR. So very strong volume growth, good pricing. 
And linking that to the consumer, I think what we're seeing is that the consumer confidence is improving in markets like India, big parts of Latin America. They are seeing the vaccine rollout. They're seeing life going back to normal. They feel better about their personal finances, and that is reflected in their consumption. At the same time, they still spend more time at home, which benefits our categories. 
Particularly, the BRIC countries are very strong with a very strong double-digit growth in India and Brazil and high single-digit growth in China and Russia. The execution there in those 4 countries has been excellent this quarter. But at the same time, looking at Africa, Poland, Pakistan, Mexico, they're all growing well. The only places in the emerging markets where we see some disruption is in some smaller markets, particularly Southeast Asia, where the COVID cases were quite severe, and there was serious restrictions. We talked about our plant in Vietnam being closed for 3 weeks. And so that has had an effect on Q3, but hopefully, that will be temporary.
On developed markets, what I would say, demand is strong. But it's a challenging operating environment, particularly in the U.S. So we had big consumption spikes in 2020, particularly in the U.S. But so far, we were up 2% in revenue in Q3 and just over 1% year-to-date, lapping a very strong last year. But if you look at a 2-year CAGR, it's over 3%. That is well above where we were in 2019, where we were growing about 2% in developed markets. And we see the consumers' behavior, where the consumer on average is spending 15% more time at home than before the pandemic, that is clearly benefiting our categories and our portfolio.
Looking particularly or specifically at North America. It's growing well on a 2-year CAGR, almost 4%, but declining slightly year-to-date versus last year. But again, 2020 was an extremely strong year for North America. The demand remains very robust in biscuits, but the service challenges in the second half due to pressures on the logistic capacity, third-party labor and the strike, which is now resolved, had an impact in Q3 and will continue to have an impact in Q4.
Europe, we're seeing a very solid quarter, very solid year-to-date. The demand for our core categories is robust. We've got very strong year-to-date revenue growth for the U.K., for Germany, the Nordics. And mass retail, which is lapping strong growth last year, is still very good. And then, of course, we're benefiting from the recovery in convenience and travel retail as the consumer is regaining mobility.
Maybe the other thing that I would say, that we are in an inflationary environment. We've been increasing prices, and we plan to increase prices more than we've done at least in the time that I'm here and probably for quite a while as a company. But what is good is that the elasticity levels are below historic levels and almost nothing to speak of. So that is helping the overall performance.
Maybe over to you, Luca."
739693,1684607455,2422079,"Mondelez International, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mondelez International, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dirk.

And as far as revenue goes, I would simply say the business is fundamentally in a good place. You might have seen in the pages that we presented that chocolates and biscuits categories are vibrant. On a 2-year stack, our share gains are very good. And you might also have noticed that pricing contribution is increasing, as you would expect given the cost pressures we are facing, but also that volume is holding up quite well.
We can also say that virtually all international businesses are positioned very well for both Q4 and 2022. However, in North America, obviously, the 6-week strike predominantly but also the volatility that Dirk mentioned is putting some pressure on our supply chain, and that will impact the Q4 performance in a context where the market is fairly positive and demand is quite good. So we estimated, mostly because of the strike impact in Q4, that there will be a 1 point of revenue pressure for the whole of Mondelez.
So to sum it up, Q4 is still going to be a good quarter, I believe, in terms of revenue when considering that there is the onetime strike impact. And at this point, we feel quite good about top line and its momentum into 2022.
From a profitability standpoint, we also feel good about the full year profit outlook. In the end, I think you know that year-to-date GP dollar is up by 5%, EBIT by 8% and all in a context where we are increasing A&C double digit with overhead flat. And I feel comfortable with our EPS high single digit guidance for 2021.
Having said that, I have to recognize that there is some GP pressure in Q3, and that will persist into Q4 and partly into 2022. The pressure is due to commodity transportation costs and compounded, quite frankly, by some industry-wide supply chain constraints. North America is driving most of the pressure in the GP line in the quarter, and it is, in fact, the only region that declined GP dollars versus last year with the other regions all above or close to our goal of 4% GP growth year-on-year.
We are taking the appropriate actions to counter those cost spikes. We had recently announced a 6% to 7% price list increase in the U.S., which will take effect in 2022, January. We have also announced pricing in Q4 in Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa and across Western Europe. We are leveraging our GM, as we said many times, also going after productivity and general cost measures. So we expect a sequential improvement versus previous years in the following quarters as more pricing kicks in.
So at this point, we believe that our 2022 EBIT growth will be solid through volume mix, pricing, obviously, productivity. And we are still contemplating meaningful A&C increases at this point. So 2022 from an EBIT standpoint should be on algorithm based on what we know today. Let's stay tuned because, obviously, Q1 will be a little bit more pressured, and we will provide more clear and comprehensive guidance in the next earnings cycle for 2022."

So historically, our global brands have been growing faster than local jewels, but we have been accelerating the growth of our local jewels and largely through renovations and activations. 2020 was different. There, our local jewels grew faster than our global brands because a number of our global brands were impacted by COVID-related changes in consumer behavior. So Toblerone, for instance, because of travel retail, declined. Halls, sorry, because there was very limited cough and cold season, and then Trident because the gum category was impacted by reduced mobility.
If you then look at 2021 -- year-to-date 2021, global brands are now growing faster again than local jewels, but both are growing very strongly. Both are in the mid-single-digit group. And we're very happy with where our local brands are at this moment. From flat to declining a few years ago, they're now, as I said, mid-single digit. We continue to step up brand investments year-over-year, and we're going to continue to activate more local jewels over time.

And then, Dirk, just your perspective on the incremental rounds of pricing that you're taking to offset inflation and I guess how it will be different this time. I think if we go back prior to your coming to Mondelez, one of the issues was that there was quite a bit of pricing taken over time to protect or build margins, and it definitely had an impact on volume, on demand. I mean it's a big part of what you came in to address and change in time you've been at Mondelez. 
So maybe you could just kind of talk about how you've thought about that dynamic this time around and how it will be different, maybe the way you're approaching pricing. Or just what's different about the ability to have some pricing power this time versus the last time Mondelez really tried to lean into pricing to protect or build margins?"

I mean as a principle, what we're trying to do is the mixture between volume growth, pricing and mix needs to offset the inflation. That's how we think about it. And then on top of that, we have a whole productivity program, which we use to increase our margins. So it's different from the past in the sense that we are not as aggressive on pricing. We're not trying to build extra margin because of pricing. We're trying, through the mixture of those 3 things, maintain it as it is. And then the extra comes from the productivity programs. 
The other big difference versus the past is that we continue to increase year-over-year our investment in our brands. First of all, our overall A&C popped, but then also how much we're shifting within A&C into working media. So the worst you can do, I think, is increase prices and not increase your support for your brand. So we've been supporting our brands now every year more and more. Our media pressure has significantly increased versus 3, 4 years ago. We can see that the brand health is increasing. So I think our brands are now more susceptible to pricing, and the consumers should accept it better. Those are the 2 big differences, Bryan, versus what it was a few years ago."

We have to take into account also that -- and we know that the current elasticity we're seeing is better. So that would potentially be an upside for us. We also are using what we call RGM, revenue growth management, which is a mixture of different techniques, if I can call it like that. And it's not always a straightforward price increase. 
If I look at the consumer, I think the main thing that had worked here is that consumer confidence is stabilizing. Mobility is on the rise. They have an ongoing desire for comfort. So they want a snack, and they're spending more time at home. All that gives a very strong demand for our categories. Our categories are growing more like 4% around the world versus the 3% that we usually planned for. 
And so I think that is leading the consumer to almost have no elasticity at the moment. And we hope -- or we think that, that will remain quite a while. And so I think we don't want to do that in our planning for next year, but we do believe that there might be better elasticity than what we're planning for at the moment."

There was virtually no impact as we enter the quarter with relatively high trade stock. Given the elevated consumption, we have depleted that stock. And so there is an impact in Q4 that we quantified together with some other supply chain-related issues at 1 point of revenue for Q4. 
From a cost standpoint, we have mitigated the cost impact. Obviously, all the puts and takes are slightly negative, but they are not meaningful on the total P&L profile for Q4. Clearly, some demand pressure -- some supply pressure will put a little bit of a cost strain on the value chain, and we will have a little bit of under-absorption kicking in, in the P&L in Q4. But that's as far as it goes. No material, I would say, overall at this point."

I'm just wondering if there's something structural or procedural in North America that makes it harder or lengthier, longer to take pricing here and just what -- if you have observations on that.
And then my follow-up question is really around the net 0 commitment. I remember a few months ago, I think there was a reticence to make that commitment that some of the other companies have made. Did something change? Did you get better visibility into how you might achieve that goal? Or is it more about things are changing out in the world faster, and therefore, you've got to make that commitment and see where it takes you?"

So Alexia, the simple answer is we had locked in -- particularly on promotional activities, also given obviously some internal dynamics to our company, which we discussed, we had locked in promotional windows and promotional activities well before Q2. And that bound us with our customers to certain promo windows and certain promo activities. And we thought that rather than disrupting even further the supply chain, our preference was really to go for a full 100% price increase as of January 1. 
So there might be a couple of quarters of dislocation. But I think, all in all, considering all the effects that we had internal and external, it was better for us to go in effect with pricing as of Q1 next year. Obviously, we will be extremely nimble here. We still don't know to what extent logistics cost will spike during the Christmas season and the holiday season in the U.S. So if we see continuous cost pressure, at this point, we cannot rule out additional pricing waves. And at that point, it will be more simultaneous to what we see than it has been this last time."

On net 0, the thinking was that we wanted to make sure that we have worked as much detail as we potentially could. And so we were a little bit reticent in the past year to declare anything until the team have done their homework. And so they've been working quite hard. We've come quite deep. I've been told that it's probably one of the deepest exercises in trying to understand how do you really get there. And so we were really wondering, a, will we get there? Can we make a plan that we can realistically believe in that it's doable? And then we wanted to know the different details step-by-step, what it means. 
So if I summarize it a little bit, it's obviously a very significant announcement for us. It's really an acceleration and an extension of our exiting initiative, applies to all our greenhouse gasses and the full supply chain, so Scope 1, 2 and 3. And with this, we are joining the UN Race to Zero and the SBTi business ambition for 1.5-degree Celsius. 
If you look at our footprint, 71% of our footprint is coming from ingredients. And so the 3 big areas we need to work on is those ingredients. It's our own operations and it's our logistics. And if you think about it, in ingredients, that means that we need to continue and increase our investment in Cocoa Life. That's one of the big factors. We have a wheat program related to regenerative agriculture. We need to extend that. 
We need to make sure that our whole packaging approach is clear on recyclable but also working on the recyclability and the use of virgin plastic over the years. We needed to get into our operations, understand renewable electricity. We need to reduce food waste, which we've done quite significantly, but we need to do more, 15% in our own operations, 50% in our distribution, for instance. We need to change all our ovens. We need to change all our boilers and so on and so on. And then in logistics, we need to switch to electric vehicles, hydrogen trucks, work on our warehouse emissions and change the efficiency of our networks, just to name a few things of what this means. 
So the team has worked through all these details, and they've come up with a plan that is credible. It's not easy. We've also made a 10-year plan for the company, Vision 2030, which during 2022, we're planning an Investor Day around that. And all the costs of net 0 have been built into that plan, which is another thing that we wanted to make sure of, that we have the costs clear. 
So that's why you felt in the past months, we were a little bit sort of hesitant because we were working through this exercise, and I really didn't know is this going to all add up and is it a plan that we can really believe in. But I think we've come up with something strong, that the company feels that we can deliver. It's not going to be easy, but that's why we can make the announcement right now."

The pressure came really from North America entities, quite frankly, mostly attributable to the logistics and transportation cost constraints that we have seen. 
We also have to acknowledge though that particularly around some commodities like edible oils, et cetera, there has been some pressure. So I would say the GP line pressure comes in Q4, mostly because of the commodity and logistics costs, and it is mostly attributable to the North American business. And so as you think going forward, pricing should really improve margins because I believe the cost severity in Q3 is quite high. It might go a little bit further in Q4 and into next year, but we cannot escalate proportionately the same amount as we have seen in Q2 and Q3 in Q4 and into 2022.

As it relates to World Travel Retail, that dropped almost to 0, I would say. It was probably at 5% of what it was before the pandemic. This year, we will probably get back to, depending a little bit what happens at the end of the year with travel, but maybe 65%, 70%. And then depending on what consumers decide to do as it relates to travel, that's the big unknown, we will, for sure, go up significantly next year. But I'm not quite sure that we will see the same amount of travel and, as a consequence, buying on travel as we saw in 2019. 
So that's still a little bit up in the air. But we will get close to -- I think gum will be all the way back. But remember, gum was growing a lot in 2019, so back but no significant growth, and World Travel Retail close but not completely, we think."

But in general, we believe that we want to outgrow our categories. And to outgrow our categories, our brands need to have more visibility, more support, more innovation than others. We believe that, that can be achieved with roughly, I would say, a 7% to 8% increase year-over-year of our A&C investment. 
And that fits into our long-term algorithm where our expectation is that half of the 4% plus growth that we want in gross profit year after year, that half of that gets reinvested. Not all of that goes into A&C. Some goes into overheads. A part goes into R&D. But overall, that's the thinking, and that allows for that roughly 7% to 8% increase. So it fits into the long-term algorithm. 
As it relates to pricing and increasing our investments, we're trying to maintain our algorithm. If we see we can get a better top line, we might do more flowing -- continuously flowing at 50% back into investment. This year, as an example, we have a double-digit increase in our A&C year-to-date, while we are doing the price increases that Luca talked about. 
Then the other movement that we're doing is within the A&C investment, we are moving more of the investment in working media. We've done that now for multiple years. So the investments are really compounding. There is an increase in overall A&C and then the increase in working media within A&C. And then we have also made big strides on the quality, the effectiveness and the ROI of our marketing. 
If you talk about where do you want to do more, we have our local jewels, which we have given significantly more investment in the last 3 years. But we want to continue to do that more on the brands that we're already supporting and activate more brands. And then as it relates to markets where we would do that, probably the -- some of the markets where we are underrepresented, largely emerging markets. That's where we think we should do the biggest increases of our A&C because we still have the category to support and really build the category for the longer term. That's how we're thinking about it. 
Not sure, Luca, if you want to add something."

If I look back, I think since 2019, even despite fine-tuning the A&C line in 2020, given obviously COVID, we have been able to increase A&C, I think, versus 2018 by 25% if you look between, again, 2018 and where we are today. 
And particularly on the working media, we have been improving quite a bit the situation about what we spend in that P&L line. And I would also say the quality of advertising and the mix of advertising is helping us improving the ROI quite a bit. And so I think that's one of the things that has made the model more sustainable for us. And I think when you look at volume growth, share gains, there is a strong linkage with these investments we have been making in global and local brands."

The white space opportunities for us are -- I mean, if you look at our building blocks for growth, the first 2 are pretty straightforward. It's make sure our categories keep on growing. We are big players in our category. Our category growth depends partly of us. Second, continue to increase our market share, and that gives us bigger growth. 
Third, there is the channel expansion that we can do. We are not having the same market share in all channels, thinking about, for instance, online or digital commerce in the more developed markets. But we're also talking about numerical distribution in emerging markets. As I was saying in the prepared remarks, we're increasing China by 120,000 stores, in India by 80,000 stores, our presence this quarter alone. 
So then on top of that, there's high growth segments within our categories. And so I'm thinking about well-being, thinking about premium. And those are some of the areas that we are underrepresented and that we should be really launching new products in there and using some of the acquisitions that we've been seeing to get in there. For instance, Grenade or Hu would fit in this category. 
Then we have geographic white spaces around the world, countries where we are not yet that present. And so we haven't done that many yet, although an acquisition like Chipita, which largely plays in East and Central Europe and some of the other emerging markets, obviously, will reinforce our presence. But they're largely in the same countries as we are or where we already have a smaller presence. But they certainly will give us more critical mass. 
And then the last one is the close-in adjacencies, which are the bakery and the bar segment. And so Chipita fits -- or Give & Go fully fall into that sort of growth opportunity that we have. And so that's the last white space. So it's between channel, high-growth segments, geographical white spaces and close-in adjacencies. Those are the 4 big white spaces that we have."
