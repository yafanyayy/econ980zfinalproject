Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. 2020 had its share of global challenges, but COVID-19 leads any discussion of the year. The pandemic affected all our communities, our way of life and resulted in an unimaginable debt toll. It affected all aspects of the world's economies, including the insurance and reinsurance industry. Despite unprecedented challenges and through the resilience and dedication of our team, Everest delivered solid 2020 results with excellent growth and improved underlying profitability. Key steps we took last year include adding to our deep and talented management team, strengthening our balance sheet, enhancing our enterprise risk management and operational discipline and further diversifying our business. Most importantly, we have been a valued partner to our distributors and customers during a very perilous time. With a strong foundation in place, we remain confident in continued operational and financial success across our business. 
We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the insurance segment while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a global and leading P&C reinsurer. As we think about our positioning in the market amongst our clients, partners and investors, we are guided by the following principles by which Everest will sees opportunities and increase the value of our company. First, we will deliver superior growth in book value per share over the cycle. Second, we are an underwriting company. One of our core competencies is the identification, underwriting, pricing and management of risk. Diversification by line of business and geography is critical. We have clearly defined and quantified risk appetites, and we maintain strong enterprise risk management and performance monitoring. Third, investment returns are a critical value driver and investment management is also a core competency. We are further optimizing our invested assets via portfolio management strategy that is complementary to our underwriting risk. With a sizable invested asset base and significant cash flow, we seek to add value and diversify the sources of income to the company. 
Fourth, we manage our capital to fuel long-term profitable growth while continuing to expand our third-party capital capabilities. And fifth, we will maintain our industry-leading financial strength. We complement our core strengths with a low-cost expense base in a flat entrepreneurial and responsive organization. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchise, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable our continued performance in today's market. We have robust momentum coming into 2021, and we are well positioned to continue diversifying our business for sustained profitable growth. I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance results, starting with the fourth quarter, followed by our full year 2020 and how these results position us well for 2021. Starting with group results. In the fourth quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 13% and net written premiums by 16% with strong growth across both segments. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved terms and conditions and rate levels, expanded shares on attractive renewals and higher retention rates on our existing book. 
Our underlying combined ratio was 86.3%, a 4-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019, with both segments showing significant improvement in loss and expense ratios. Net investment income was very strong at $222 million compared to $146 million in the prior year quarter. For 2020, Everest grew gross written premiums 15% and net written premiums, 17% year-over-year. We delivered $514 million in net income and $300 million in operating income despite the COVID-19 loss provision, the prior year reserve strengthening and an active cat year. Our dividend-adjusted book value per share grew over 11%. We are focused on delivering superior growth and book value per share over the market cycle. The underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 87.5% year-over-year, with our insurance segment improving 2.3 points to $94.2 million. Net investment income was in line with prior year despite the market volatility. These results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our ability to thrive in any market. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions, including managing attachment points, limits, terms and conditions, targeted nonrenewals and many other actions. This is the hard work of building and sustaining a profitable book. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything that we do. 
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we strengthened prior accident year reserves in our reinsurance segment by $400 million. The reserve strengthening does not change our view of current accident year loss picks as we had already selected more conservative loss picks in response to general loss trends. We are confident in the prior year reserving actions we took in the quarter and the quality of the in-force portfolio. These decisive actions will serve us well. 
In the fourth quarter, we also added $76 million, primarily for third-party lines to our COVID-19 loss provision. Despite a high-frequency of storms in the fourth quarter, our manageable catastrophe losses of $70 million resulted from disciplined underwriting and the purposeful reduction of volatility over the last 2 years in our reinsurance portfolio. Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson are on this call and can provide more detail on these actions during Q&A. 
For our Reinsurance division, the fourth quarter continued our strong growth. Gross written premiums grew 12% in the quarter and 15% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio ex COVID was 83.9%, an improvement from 87.4% in the prior fourth quarter. January 1 is our largest renewal date, and this 1 was 1 of the strongest in many years. The rate environment improved across most territories and lines of business with loss impacted business seeing material increases. Capacity is abundant, but reinsurers remain disciplined on pricing and terms and conditions. There is a flight to quality where ever strong balance sheet and highly rated financial strength set us apart. Customer and broker demand for adverse capacity is strong, as highlighted by our increased shares and preferential signings on treaties, Counterparties actively want to do more business with Everest. Our responsiveness ability to deploy significant capital and reputation of problem solvers in the market were critical to a successful renewal season. We saw outstanding results in Latin America, in the U.S. and Canada as well as meaningful growth in Continental Europe. We had notable wins on large deals and increase our share with core customers and in territories and classes we found the most attractive, including facultative business. 
We continue to expand and diversify the portfolio as we execute to achieve a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. Specific to our January 1 property book, total limit outstanding increased with an increase in rate online and significant improvements in the combined ratio, ROE, risk-adjusted return and increased dollars of expected margin. We have a stronger and more profitable portfolio. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. 
Our Insurance division continued its solid execution as evidenced by our results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020. Gross written premiums grew 15% or 18%, excluding terminated programs, with gross written premium of $872 million in the quarter, and over $3.2 billion for 2020. Both fourth quarter and full year 2020 revenues are milestones for the insurance division. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management strong rate in target classes and improving activity in certain lines of business such as transactional liability that was partially offset by reductions in economically impacted areas such as energy, sports, leisure and entertainment. Average insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 93.8% for the fourth quarter, a 4.3 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019 and 94.2% for the full year 2020, a 2.3 point improvement over 2019. These results are driven by portfolio and expense management and are consistent with expanding insurance margins. We achieved record renewal rate increases of 21% in the fourth quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 14%, including workers' compensation, where we are seeing rates flatten. Rate is outpacing our expected loss trend and renewal retention across the entire portfolio is strong. The rate we achieved is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. 
After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments are necessary, and we expect they will continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, these increases are led by property, up 21%, excess casualty, up 50%, D&O, up 35% and commercial auto, up 17%. And we are also seeing widespread increases in other lines of business, which have been slower to turn, most notably general liability, now up 9%. We are managing the insurance portfolio to build a diversified business and see our mixed store product lines that earn higher long-term margins. Our position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. My Carmelo is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. We have a vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance business with experienced teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. Building on the achievements of 2020, we will continue diversifying our business for profitable growth and sustained momentum throughout 2021. The company is on solid ground with excellent financial strength ratings, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. The relentless execution of our strategies result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in ever's future and on our ability to deliver the commitments to our customers, shareholders and the marketplace. 2020 showed us all just how resilient we truly are. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?"
340813,700394360,2200402,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Wan discussed in our pre-release outlined, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4, improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent ca",1148,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Wan discussed in our pre-release outlined, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4, improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent capital position. I'll touch on these over the next few minutes. The positive quarterly net income result was achieved despite a prior year reserve strengthening charge of $400 million, a COVID provision of $76 million and catastrophe losses of $70 million. This clearly demonstrates the diversification and earnings power of Everest. 
Everest reported net income of $64 million for the quarter and $514 million for the year, resulting in a return on equity of 5.8% for 2020. We had a $44 million operating loss for Q4 given the charges and generated an operating income of $300 million for the year. Our net income in the quarter reflects strong investment income performance and improved attritional loss and combined ratios, offset by cat, COVID and reserve charges. The catastrophe losses of $70 million are pretax and net of reinsurance, with $60 million from reinsurance and $10 million from insurance, driven by Hurricanes Delta, Zeta and the Australian Queensland hailstorm. The estimate implied market share of industry losses is just over 60 basis points for Everest. This is an excellent result, reflecting the underwriting and risk management initiatives of the past 2 years. There was also no development from prior cats in the Q4 charge. Year-to-date, the results include catastrophe losses of $425 million compared to $576 million during 2019. All amounts are pretax and net of reinstatement premiums. 
In the fourth quarter, we added $76 million to our COVID loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our consistent reserving philosophy. This additional provision is predominantly IBNR for third-party lines. This amount includes $56 million in the reinsurance segment and $20 million in the insurance segment and is in addition to the $435 million of pandemic losses estimated in the first 9 months of 2020. Our fourth quarter estimates were not impacted by the recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling, as we had taken a prudent approach to loss assessment leading up to that ruling. For the full year 2020, the total pandemic loss provision is $511 million, of which more than 80% is classified as IBNR. 
Everest had an underwriting loss in Q4 of $219 million due to the prior year reserve adjustment charge as compared to an underwriting loss of $29 million for Q4 2019. As Juan mentioned, we booked a $400 million prior year reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter, exclusively for the Reinsurance division, primarily within long tail casualty segments. Such as GL, auto liability and professional lines for accident years 2015 through 2018. The reserve charge also includes actions on non cap property lines, primarily for the 2017 through 2019 accident years and driven by a few large losses to aggregate programs. Our reserve studies indicate that the insurance division overall has strong and adequate reserve levels. At a granular level, we address some redundancies and deficiencies with no overall financial impact. The lines we strengthened included professional liability in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. This was offset by releases in other lines. 
Turning to Everest's market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $10.5 billion, up $1.3 billion or 15% compared to 2019. This reflects strong and diversified growth in both segments, with reinsurance up 15% and insurance up 15% compared to 2019. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and improving. Excluding the catastrophe losses and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the attritional combined ratio was 87.5% for 2020 compared to 88.4% for 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for 2020 was 60.1%, down from 60.2% for 2019, with insurance improving from 66% to 64.8%. 
For Reinsurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate and prior year reserve charge was 85.2%, down from 85.5% in 2019. For insurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 94.2% compared to 96.5% in 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our insurance business continues to run at an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. The group commission ratio of 21.6% year-to-date was down from 23% in 2019, largely due to business mix, a onetime significant contingent commission in the reinsurance segment during 2019 and higher ceding commission in the insurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% for 2020 versus 6% for 2019 as we benefited from premium growth and continued focus on expense management. 
Q4 investment income had a strong performance of $222 million compared to $146 million for Q4 2019. For the full year, pretax investment income was $642 million versus $647 million for 2019. The fixed income portfolio generated $542 million of investment income year-to-date. Compared to $520 million for the same period last year. Limited partnerships recorded $91 million of income quarter-to-date, largely due to fair market value adjustments. The limited partnership result was due to the continued improvement of the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. Invested assets grew 23% to $25.4 billion versus $20.7 billion last year-end. This strong invested asset growth was due to $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and the proceeds of our debt issue. The pretax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was just under 3%, down from 3.4% 1 year ago. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with duration of 3.6 years. The remaining portfolio is allocated to equities and other invested assets, which are largely private equity investments with the residual amount in short-term investments and cash. 
Our effective tax rate on operating income for 2020 was 7.7% and 12.1% on net income. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about 6 points of loss ratio. Everest generated record operating cash flows of $2.9 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2019, reflecting the strength of our growing premiums in 2020 year-over-year and a more modest level of claims paid. Everest enjoys very strong financial strength with ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $9.7 billion at year-end 2020, and up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. Net book value per share stood at $243.25, up 11.4% versus year-end 2019 and adjusted for dividends. Everest's strong balance sheet was further strengthened by the 30-year [ 1 billion ] senior notes offering completed in early October 2020. This is long-term capital for Everest and enhances the efficiency of our capital structure with our debt leverage now standing at 16.4%. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon."

So I start there by giving you a sense of the detail of granularity that we go through and basically coming up with the strengthening that we did in the quarter. Now that being said, as we set the accident years really beginning at the end of 2019.

And you can see that by our numbers for the fourth quarter and the full year underwriting results. That improvement in insurance and reinsurance is really driven by portfolio management, decisive underwriting actions and intentional shifts in our portfolio mix. If we exclude workers' compensation, we're also seeing the rates are outpacing our expected loss cost. And as that rate is being earned on a growing premium base, that's also going to have a positive impact on expected margin going forward. But also -- and I would point this up because this is a very important point, in addition to rate, we're also taking a broad array of underwriting actions, including more granular segmentation in the in force book, management of attachment points, limits terms and conditions, we're doing targeted nonrenewals and many other actions. So we're doing a number of things that you're starting to see show up in the underlying profitability of both insurance and reinsurance that are by design and that are very proactive. It's not just all about rate, but it's also about all the other tools that we have in our kit about improving underlying margins. But all of that being said, and I think this goes to your question, Mike. It's important to keep in mind that some lines do require more rate than others. It also depends on the starting point. It depends on the loss cost trends. And we also have to recognize that we're in an environment where the impact of COVID and the time that it will take for some of lease claims to emerge, there's some uncertainty, right? We also have to think about the underlying social inflation costs. So overall, I feel very good about the margin momentum that we're creating in this business. It's not just about rate, but it's also about all the underlying levers that we're pulling forth. And I feel very good and very comfortable with both books of business going into 2021."

It's now roughly down to about 16% of our mix, down from about 24%. And  again, this has been done in a purposeful way, right? As you would have seen less attractive pricing in the comp book, we have diversified into a business. And so you see our growth in lines like casualty property, D&O, et cetera. The other thing that we have done in our comp book is we have also moved more towards loss sensitive business, loss rated business on the comp side, and we've done less basically guaranteed comp business at that point in time. So we're actively managing the trends. We're actively managing what we're seeing in the environment and obviously, trying to continue to drive a lot of profit in that comp book. But let me ask Mike Karm to jump in specifically on your question about California."

As I mentioned before to Elyse's question, particularly when we set the accident year loss picks for 2020 and 2021 we were more conservative than the picks that had been in place for the 2015 through 2019 accident years. And that was really a reflection of what we saw in the environment some of the industry trends that we were seeing, et cetera. So we took a more prudent approach in being able to set those. So I would tell you that as I sit here today, looking at 2020, 2021, they're stronger than the picks that we had in place for '15 to '18.

And then other areas where we've taken so much rate, some of the underwriting actions and the picks have come down. I think the key thing to keep in mind, though, is that, as Juan had indicated, we took a very conservative approach to the setting of the loss picks for the 2020 accident year of the 2021 accident year. And those picks are consistent with the level of ultimate loss ratio that's coming out of the reserve studies. And that gives us confidence that our starting point is the right one. We're taking rate in excess of our loss trend, right? So those things give you confidence that moving forward, we're positioned in the right way in the portfolio."

We certainly have seen an improvement in the expense ratio, and that's really coming from 2 areas. One is on the commission side. And I think there's different factors there. I think if you look at insurance first, part of that is that we're writing more direct business to our brokers and less DUA business overall. And so I think that's part of what you're seeing there. We also, in our insurance business, because of mix, get the benefit of improved seat commissions. I think our team has done a very good job in setting up the external reinsurance program. So you see some of that coming through on the commissions. On the reinsurance side, I think it's also pointed to mix at the same time on the commission line. But more importantly, to me, it's really the operating expense ratio. One of the hallmarks of our company has been that we are lean. We're disciplined on how we manage expenses. We invest where we need to invest in technology and people and infrastructure, but we're also very disciplined about how we do that. And that's something that you saw us continue to accomplish in 2020 and into 2021. That actually drives that expense ratio to where you see it today. We also experienced loss ratio improvement. And you see that particularly in the insurance business for 2020. And that is really related to all of those actions that I mentioned in my opening remarks, what I term is really the hard work of running a profitable book of business, right? This is managing attachment points and limits. And of programs and books of business that you're not comfortable with and always seeking out the best economic opportunities to continue to improve the profitability of that business. So to me, those are all the actions that 1 has to take to continue to improve underwriting profitability and sustain a profitable book going forward."

And we did that and feel very comfortable with it because of the pricing, the terms and conditions that we're getting. Look, at the end of the day, volatility in and of itself is not a bad thing as long as you're getting paid for it. And from our perspective, we were getting paid for it in January 1. We were getting paid for it throughout 2020. Now that being said, our goal is to build a diversified book of business is not just to ride 1 pony, if you will. And so if the opportunities are there on cat to be able to do it profitably, to get a good risk-adjusted return, improve our ROEs, et cetera. We're going to do it. And you saw us do that in the renewal season of last year and really going into January 1. So the appetite is there, but it's there at a price, and it's there at a point that makes sense to us economically. So with that, let me turn it over to John Doucette and have him add some color as well."

And really, it was a question of how we allocated the book and where we decided to deploy the capacity and so number one, where do we decide to deploy the capacity. We also saw very good opportunities in the primary property space. So we deployed more capacity into both cat and to primary property quota share, which we like the risk return on that opportunity. So that's number one. Number two, as noted, we have increased the AUM and Logan and continue to look for ways to increase that and look to have that continue to be a very strategic part of our volatility management, capital management. And that will help decrease the volatility that you're seeing? And then number three, as Juan said, a lot of this is about diversification, diversification within the reinsurance diversification by growing the insurance operations. So it's different lines, territories, products, and that will result in just the -- a lower dollars may be flat, but -- or even up a little bit, but as a percentage of overall gross premium, the percentage of our cat load could be lower."

I would say that on that 6% cat load that Mark was referring to, it's really a question of how we manage our exposure in the reinsurance book. And really, what we have been doing, frankly, over the last 18 months or so to make sure that we're in a better place, more profitable place, more sustainable place from a catastrophe standpoint. Again, I go back to what I said earlier. We like cat, but it has to be priced right. Has to be managed correctly. You've seen a lot of things that we have done that have been frankly reflected in some of the catastrophe loss numbers that we've put out in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We have moved up the higher attachment points. We're writing less aggregate programs. We're frankly, writing a more profitable book, a more sustainable book. And so that's part of what you see there. The other part of that is our Capital Shield, our hedging strategy for the company. Logan certainly plays a role there. Our Kilimanjaro bonds certainly play a role there. And there's other things that we're doing at the same time. You will see that we grew AUM in our Logan book, in our logan vehicle to the beginning of this year, and that certainly helps us well in essentially protecting our net position within the company.

It's part of a holistic suite of both what we're doing on the growth side, capital management side and the hedging side, and it's part of that. But it's clearly a core part of this -- of how we're thinking capital management and volatility management going forward. But I mean, we also saw, as Juan said earlier, while we did increase limits on the gross portfolio in our property book, across property, cat, retro, and pro rata, we did increase that because of the opportunity set. But we saw an increase in overall premium and a larger increase in expected dollar margin and percentage margin and an increase in the ROE. So part of it is how we're thinking of what we want to keep on our balance sheet and other parts of the balance sheet. But I do think it's more, I think, than your -- how you're focusing on it. It's more a function of the diversification as a function of premium, it really has more to do with the diversification, the growth in the insurance operation as a percentage, the growth in reinsurance in different lines of business, we saw a lot of opportunities in casualty, continue to see opportunities in mortgage, professional liability, significant opportunities, in fact, and all of that is on the -- is growing the denominator of the 6% cat load that you're talking about.

There's also the fact that we had some pretty large losses coming through in some of those years, whether it was wildfires, MGM, et cetera. And that's part of that. And then the other part of that is really just general social inflation or the trend that we saw out in the market. That was generating some higher severity losses than what we anticipated.

And so I'd sort of close it out with just a little bit of color around the piece of your question that sort of looks to translate see underlying loss ratio to what we're experiencing. I mean look, the reserving process is based on our own loss activity. And I think there are clearly areas where you can draw a more direct connection, if you're talking about, for example, a quota share book. So in the cases where we're participating in a proportional fashion with our cedents. And they're seeing social inflation, average claim sizes have increased on the casualty side. Or in the case of water damage claims that are elevating property losses, that's going to be a more direct translation, where I think that starts to break down those. When you start talking about treaty structures that are not a direct quota share participation, you can't always draw those direct lines. And so I'd be a little bit careful about that. But if you think about the things and the general trends that have affected primary insurers and the 15 to 18 on the casualty, sort of 16 to '19 in property, it's sort of the same drivers of loss that we are seeing in our book are the ones you're hearing from other companies.

Look, I go back to some of my earlier comments where, for us, it's not just simply about rate. But it's also about all the other levers that we have within the underwriting portfolio and within the underwriting toolkit that we're executing upon, right? So if you think about how John and his team are positioning the team from an attachment standpoint from a structure into treaties, how they're playing on pro ratas to be able to take advantage of the improvement in primary rates, et cetera, et cetera. All of these are things that are going into the improvement of our underlying margin. And frankly, why I said at the beginning of all of this that we are building meaningful margin momentum in our underlying book of business, and I feel pretty good about that. So the reality is, is we're working at this every day, whether it's in reinsurance, on insurance, with the goal of continuing to improve our margins, improve our profitability, improve our loss ratios, et cetera, et cetera. So you're going to continue seeing taking actions across the board. Again, not just necessarily all rate related, but there's a lot of things we can do in the portfolio that also influence that, and we're doing them today."

We happen to be at a place in time where we have terrific opportunities in the insurance side, on the reinsurance side, and you see from our numbers, we're taking advantage of them. Factors we're leaning forward. The fact that we grew 15% in a pandemic year with an economic recession, exposure reductions, I think, is a very good outcome. And I think that gives you a sense of how we're investing in our business to continue to grow and take advantage of those opportunities. At the same time, we also then look at other things that we can do to return capital to our shareholders. And I'll let Mark to talk a little bit about that."

So you're definitely seeing that essentially come through at the same time. Now regarding the point on climate change, we are very mindful of that, right? So 1 of the things that our modeling does, particularly on the reinsurance division, is really look at the impact of a rise in sea temperatures that you can clearly see from 1995 and based on that, we have adapted our modeling, we have updated our points of view on risk, on pricing to better be able to manage that. So all of that is essentially baked into that. But let me turn it over to John to set and let him add a little bit of color on that as well."

So 2 things we spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of how we manage the risk in our property portfolio. It's all the aspects of climate risk we spent a lot of time looking at wildfire and frankly, derisking the wildfire exposure in our portfolio. I spent a lot of time looking at the warm C surface temperature looking at droughts and the propensity for drought. So a lot of how we deploy capacity, what should the right, attachments, products, terms, conditions and frankly, rate be looking at that. So #1 is climate change. Number two, we've also been looking a lot at the different social inflation and risks that we've seen in the books, things like assignment of benefits to LAE, the increase in LAE that we've seen in different areas. Both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And so that's all factored into how we think about building the best portfolio, learning from the lessons that the industry is seeing and really positioning our book on a go-forward basis. And then also -- so it has some loss trends for the reasons I just mentioned, climate and some of the social issues. But it also -- we also are seeing the uplift that we're getting from improved rates, terms, conditions, occurrence clauses, hours clauses, et cetera, et cetera. So all of that is -- we have several countercurrents that result in the 6% you're looking at here."

So in -- it will vary by line by territory, et cetera, by loss experience of the client. So 1 of -- there's been significant underlying rate improvement in terms of condition improvement on casualty and professional liability. And so our view is that the casualty reinsurance market was rational for the most part, ceding commissions were about flat, but we did see an economic uplift. At one just based on our exposure to the underlying terms and conditions. And then that would be very loss dependent. If somebody had bad poor loss experience that you could see a cut in the ceding commissions. And on property overall, we did see an improvement in the overall reinsurance terms. And both in terms of like occurrence limits as well as seeding commissions. And I think that really was just a function of the overall capacity dearth on proportional reinsurance. So we were able to deploy and wanted to deploy more into that space."

Like I mentioned, we are the beneficiary of that for some of the things Juan mentioned earlier about ceding commissions that we gained by some of the portfolio mix in certain lines like specialty, casualty and other specialty lines like transactional and credit political. So we tend to have really top talent in these areas, which I think have generated better terms and conditions for us and some more reinsurance.

2020 had its share of global challenges, but COVID-19 leads any discussion of the year. The pandemic affected all our communities, our way of life and resulted in an unimaginable death toll. It affected all aspects of the world's economies, including the insurance and reinsurance industry. 
Despite unprecedented challenges and through the resilience and dedication of our team, Everest delivered solid 2020 results with excellent growth and improved underlying profitability. Key steps we took last year include adding to our deep and talented management team, strengthening our balance sheet, enhancing our enterprise risk management and operational discipline and further diversifying our business. Most importantly, we have been a valued partner to our distributors and customers during a very perilous time. 
With a strong foundation in place, we remain confident in continued operational and financial success across our business. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the Insurance segment while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a global and leading P&C reinsurer. 
As we think about our positioning in the market amongst our clients, partners and investors, we are guided by the following principles by which Everest will seize opportunities and increase the value of our company. First, we will deliver superior growth in book value per share over the cycle. 
Second, we are an underwriting company. One of our core competencies is the identification, underwriting, pricing and management of risk. Diversification by line of business and geography is critical. We have clearly defined and quantified risk appetites, and we maintain strong enterprise risk management and performance monitoring. 
Third, investment returns are a critical value driver and investment management is also a core competency. We are further optimizing our invested assets via portfolio management strategy that is complementary to our underwriting risk. With a sizable invested asset base and significant cash flow, we seek to add value and diversify the sources of income to the company.  
Fourth, we manage our capital to fuel long-term profitable growth while continuing to expand our third-party capital capabilities. And fifth, we will maintain our industry-leading financial strength. We complement our core strengths with a low-cost expense base in a flat entrepreneurial and responsive organization. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchise, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable our continued performance in today's market. We have robust momentum coming into 2021, and we are well positioned to continue diversifying our business for sustained profitable growth. 
I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance results, starting with the fourth quarter, followed by our full year 2020 and how these results position us well for 2021. Starting with group results. In the fourth quarter, we grew gross written premiums by 13% and net written premiums by 16% with strong growth across both segments. Our growth stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved terms and conditions and rate levels, expanded shares on attractive renewals and high retention rates on our existing book. 
Our underlying combined ratio was 86.3%, a 4-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019, with both segments showing significant improvement in loss and expense ratios. Net investment income was very strong at $222 million compared to $146 million in the prior year quarter. 
For 2020, Everest grew gross written premiums 15% and net written premiums 17% year-over-year. We delivered $514 million in net income and $300 million in operating income despite the COVID-19 loss provision, the prior year reserve strengthening and an active cat year. Our dividend-adjusted book value per share grew over 11%. We are focused on delivering superior growth and book value per share over the market cycle. 
The underlying combined ratio improved almost 1 point to 87.5% year-over-year, with our Insurance segment improving 2.3 points to 94.2%. Net investment income was in line with prior year despite the market volatility. These results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our ability to thrive in any market. 
We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions, including managing attachment points, limits, terms and conditions, targeted nonrenewals and many other actions. This is the hard work of building and sustaining a profitable book. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything that we do.  
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we strengthened prior accident year reserves in our Reinsurance segment by $400 million. The reserve strengthening does not change our view of current accident year loss picks as we had already selected more conservative loss picks in response to general loss trends. We are confident of the prior year reserving actions we took in the quarter and the quality of the in-force portfolio. These decisive actions will serve us well. 
In the fourth quarter, we also added $76 million, primarily for third-party lines, to our COVID-19 loss provision. Despite a high frequency of storms in the fourth quarter, our manageable catastrophe losses of $70 million resulted from disciplined underwriting and the purposeful reduction of volatility over the last 2 years in our reinsurance portfolio. Mark Kociancic and Jim Williamson are on this call and can provide more detail on these actions during Q&A.  
For our Reinsurance division, the fourth quarter continued our strong growth. Gross written premiums grew 12% in the quarter and 15% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio ex COVID was 83.9%, an improvement from 87.4% in the prior fourth quarter. 
January 1 is our largest renewal date, and this one was one of the strongest in many years. The rate environment improved across most territories and lines of business with loss impacted business seeing material increases. 
Capacity is abundant, but reinsurers remain disciplined on pricing and terms and conditions. There is a flight to quality where Everest's balance sheet and highly rated financial strength set us apart. Customer and broker demand for adverse capacity is strong, as highlighted by our increased shares and preferential signings on treaties, Counterparties actively want to do more business with Everest. 
Our responsiveness, ability to deploy significant capital and reputation as problem solvers in the market were critical to a successful renewal season. We saw outstanding results in Latin America, in the U.S. and Canada as well as meaningful growth in Continental Europe. We had notable wins on large deals and increased our share with core customers and in territories and classes we found the most attractive, including Facultative business.  
We continue to expand and diversify the portfolio as we execute to achieve a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. Specific to our January 1 property book, total limit outstanding increased with an increase in rate online and significant improvements in the combined ratio, ROE, risk-adjusted return and increased dollars of expected margin. We have a stronger and more profitable portfolio. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.  
Our Insurance division continued its solid execution as evidenced by our results in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020. Gross written premiums grew 15% or 18% excluding terminated programs, with gross written premium of $872 million in the quarter and over $3.2 billion for 2020. Both fourth quarter and full year 2020 revenues are milestones for the Insurance division. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, strong rate in target classes and improving activity in certain lines of business such as transactional liability that was partially offset by reductions in economically impacted areas such as energy, sports, leisure and entertainment. 
Everest Insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 93.8% for the fourth quarter, a 4.3-point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019; and 94.2% for the full year 2020, a 2.3-point improvement over 2019. These results are driven by portfolio and expense management and are consistent with expanding insurance margins. 
We achieved record renewal rate increases of 21% in the fourth quarter excluding workers' compensation and up 14% including workers' compensation, where we are seeing rates flatten. Rate is outpacing our expected loss trend, and renewal retention across the entire portfolio is strong. The rate we achieved is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses.  
After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments are necessary, and we expect they will continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, these increases are led by property, up 21%; Excess Casualty, up 50%; D&O, up 35%; and commercial auto, up 17%. We are also seeing widespread increases in other lines of business which have been slower to turn, most notably general liability, now up 9%. 
We are managing the insurance portfolio to build a diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher long-term margins. Our position in both the E&S and retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
We have a vibrant and well-diversified Reinsurance and Insurance business with experienced teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. Building on the achievements of 2020, we will continue diversifying our business for profitable growth and sustained momentum throughout 2021. 
The company is on solid ground with excellent financial strength ratings, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. The relentless execution of our strategies result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest's future and on our ability to deliver the commitments to our customers, shareholders and the marketplace. 2020 showed us all just how resilient we truly are. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?"
340813,700394360,2200584,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan discussed in our pre-release outline, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4, improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent ca",1142,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. As Juan discussed in our pre-release outline, Everest had strong underlying results for the quarter and the year with positive net income in Q4, improving underlying margin, continued growth and an excellent capital position. I'll touch on these over the next few minutes. 
The positive quarterly net income result was achieved despite a prior year reserve strengthening charge of $400 million, a COVID provision of $76 million and catastrophe losses of $70 million. This clearly demonstrates the diversification and earnings power of Everest. 
Everest reported net income of $64 million for the quarter and $514 million for the year, resulting in a return on equity of 5.8% for 2020. We had a $44 million operating loss for Q4 given the charges and generated an operating income of $300 million for the year. Our net income in the quarter reflects strong investment income performance and improved attritional loss and combined ratios, offset by cat, COVID and reserve charges. 
The catastrophe losses of $70 million are pretax and net of reinsurance, with $60 million from reinsurance and $10 million from insurance driven by Hurricanes Delta, Zeta and the Australian Queensland hail storm. The estimate implied market share of industry losses is just over 60 basis points for Everest. This is an excellent result, reflecting the underwriting and risk management initiatives of the past 2 years. There was also no development from prior cats in the Q4 charge.
Year-to-date, the results include catastrophe losses of $425 million compared to $576 million during 2019. All amounts are pretax and net of reinstatement premiums. 
In the fourth quarter, we added $76 million to our COVID loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our consistent reserving philosophy. This additional provision is predominantly IBNR for third-party lines. This amount includes $56 million in the Reinsurance segment and $20 million in the Insurance segment and is in addition to the $435 million of pandemic losses estimated in the first 9 months of 2020. Our fourth quarter estimates were not impacted by the recent U.K. Supreme Court ruling as we had taken a prudent approach to loss assessment leading up to that ruling. For the full year 2020, the total pandemic loss provision is $511 million, of which more than 80% is classified as IBNR.  
Everest had an underwriting loss in Q4 of $219 million due to the prior year reserve adjustment charge as compared to an underwriting loss of $29 million for Q4 2019. As Juan mentioned, we booked a $400 million prior year reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter exclusively for the Reinsurance division, primarily within long-tail casualty segments such as GL, auto liability and professional lines for accident years 2015 through 2018. The reserve charge also includes actions on non-cat property lines primarily for the 2017 through 2019 accident years, driven by a few large losses to aggregate programs. 
Our reserve studies indicate that the Insurance division overall has strong and adequate reserve levels. At a granular level, we address some redundancies and deficiencies with no overall financial impact. The lines we strengthened included professional liability in the 2015 through 2018 accident years. This was offset by releases in other lines.  
Turning to Everest's market position and growth. On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $10.5 billion, up $1.3 billion or 15% compared to 2019. This reflects strong and diversified growth in both segments, with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to 2019. 
Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and improving. Excluding the catastrophe losses and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the attritional combined ratio was 87.5% for 2020 compared to 88.4% for 2019. Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for 2020 was 60.1%, down from 60.2% for 2019, with Insurance improving from 66% to 64.8%.  
For Reinsurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate and prior year reserve charge was 85.2%, down from 85.5% in 2019. For Insurance, the 2020 attritional combined ratio excluding the pandemic loss estimate was 94.2% compared to 96.5% in 2019. Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Insurance business, continues to run at an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s excluding the pandemic loss estimate. 
The group commission ratio of 21.6% year-to-date was down from 23% in 2019, largely due to business mix, a onetime significant contingent commission in the Reinsurance segment during 2019 and higher ceding commission in the Insurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.8% for 2020 versus 6% for 2019 as we benefited from premium growth and continued focus on expense management.  
Q4 investment income had a strong performance of $222 million compared to $146 million for Q4 2019. For the full year, pretax investment income was $642 million versus $647 million for 2019. 
The fixed income portfolio generated $542 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $520 million for the same period last year. Limited partnerships recorded $91 million of income quarter to date largely due to fair market value adjustments. The limited partnership result was due to the continued improvement of the economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. 
Invested assets grew 23% to $25.4 billion versus $20.7 billion last year-end. This strong invested asset growth was due to $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and the proceeds of our debt issue. Pretax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was just under 3%, down from 3.4% 1 year ago. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with duration of 3.6 years. The remaining portfolio is allocated to equities and other invested assets, which are largely private equity investments, with the residual amount in short-term investments and cash.  
Our effective tax rate on operating income for 2020 was 7.7% and 12.1% on net income. For 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an annual cat load of about 6 points of loss ratio. 
Everest generated record operating cash flows of $2.9 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2019, reflecting the strength of our growing premiums in 2020 year-over-year and a more modest level of claims paid. Everest enjoys very strong financial strength with ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $9.7 billion at year-end 2020, up from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. Net book value per share stood at $243.25, up 11.4% versus year-end 2019, adjusted for dividends. 
Everest's strong balance sheet was further strengthened by the 30-year $1 billion senior notes offering completed in early October 2020. This is long-term capital for Everest and enhances the efficiency of our capital structure, with our debt leverage now standing at 16.4%.  
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon."

So we basically look at the accident years, underwriting years.

So I start there by giving you a sense of the detail of granularity that we go through and basically coming up with the strengthening that we did in the quarter. 
Now that being said, as we set the accident years really beginning at the end of 2019 and as we set the 2020 accident year, as we've set the 2021 accident year, we were already looking at some of the loss trends that are impacting the industry. And so we bake those in when we made those loss picks. That's also one of the reasons why you don't see us taking up current accident year loss picks as a result of the reserve charge."

Look, I think we are building meaningful margin momentum, and you can see that by our numbers for the fourth quarter and the full year underwriting results.

Look, I think we are building meaningful margin momentum, and you can see that by our numbers for the fourth quarter and the full year underwriting results. That improvement both in Insurance and Reinsurance is really driven by portfolio management, decisive underwriting actions and intentional shifts in our portfolio mix. If we exclude workers' compensation, we're also seeing the rates are outpacing our expected loss cost. And as that rate is being earned on a growing premium base, that's also going to have a positive impact on expected margin going forward. 
But also -- and I would point this out because this is a very important point in addition to rate. We're also taking a broad array of underwriting actions, including more granular segmentation in the in-force book, management of attachment points, limits, terms and conditions. We're doing targeted nonrenewals and many other actions. So we're doing a number of things that you're starting to see show up in the underlying profitability of both Insurance and Reinsurance that are by design and that are very proactive. It's not just all about rate, but it's also about all the other tools that we have in our kit about improving underlying margins. 
But all of that being said, and I think this goes to your question, Mike, it's important to keep in mind that some lines do require more rate than others. It also depends on the starting point. It depends on the loss cost trends. And we also have to recognize that we're in an environment where the impact of COVID and the time that it will take for some of these claims to emerge, there's some uncertainty, right? We also have to think about the underlying social inflation costs. 
So overall, I feel very good about the margin momentum that we're creating in this business. It's not just about rate, but it's also about all the underlying levers that we're pulling forth. And I feel very good and very comfortable with both books of business going into 2021."

And then other areas where we've taken so much rate, some of the underwriting actions and the picks have come down. 
I think the key thing to keep in mind though is that, as Juan had indicated, we took a very conservative approach to the setting of the loss picks for the 2020 accident year, the 2021 accident year. And those picks are consistent with the level of ultimate loss ratio that's coming out of the reserve studies. And that gives us confidence that our starting point is the right one. 
We're taking rate in excess of our loss trend, right? So those things give you confidence that moving forward, we're positioned in the right way in the portfolio."

We have a leading franchise in P&C reinsurance. We're the seventh largest in the world. We are aiming to continue to grow that presence, continue to take advantage of those opportunities. So absolutely not. 
As a matter of fact, I would also point you to my comments around our January 1 renewals and the fact that we had one of the strongest renewals we have seen in a number of years. And so look, as long as the market opportunity is there, as long as we can underwrite profitably, we're taking advantage of that.

Most of the improvement during this year has come on the expense ratio side of the combined ratio despite very, very strong rate increases already coming through in earned rates. 
I'm wondering if you can talk about why we're seeing such large expense ratio improvements and whether it's sustainable. And just given your many, many years of working in the industry, what's going on here? This is not just an Everest phenomenon."

We certainly have seen an improvement in the expense ratio, and that's really coming from 2 areas. One is on the commission side, and I think there's different factors there. 
I think if you look at insurance first, part of that is that we're writing more direct business through our brokers and less DUA business overall. And so I think that's part of what you're seeing there. We also in our insurance business, because of mix, get the benefit of improved cede commissions. I think our team has done a very good job in setting up their external reinsurance program so you see some of that coming through on the commissions. 
On the reinsurance side, I think it's also pointed to mix, at the same time, on the commission line. But more importantly, to me, it's really the operating expense ratio. One of the hallmarks of our company has been that we are lean. We're disciplined on how we manage expenses. We invest where we need to invest in technology and people and infrastructure, but we're also very disciplined about how we do that. And that's something that you saw us continue to accomplish in 2020 and onto 2021. That actually drives that expense ratio to where you see it today. 
We also experienced loss ratio improvement, and you see that particularly in the Insurance business for 2020. And that is really related to all of those actions that I mentioned in my opening remarks, what I term is really the hard work of running a profitable book of business, right? This is managing attachment points and limits and running off programs and books of business that you're not comfortable with and always seeking out the best economic opportunities to continue to improve the profitability of that business. So to me, those are all the actions that one has to take to continue to improve underwriting profitability and sustain a profitable book going forward."

And we did that and feel very comfortable with it because of the pricing, the terms and conditions that we're getting. 
Look, at the end of the day, volatility in and of itself is not a bad thing as long as you're getting paid for it. And from our perspective, we were getting paid for it in January 1. We were getting paid for it throughout 2020. 
Now that being said, our goal is to build a diversified book of business. It's not just to ride 1 pony, if you will. And so if the opportunities are there on cat to be able to do it profitably, to get a good risk-adjusted return, improve our ROEs, et cetera, we're going to do it, and you saw us do that in the renewal seasons of last year and really going into January 1. 
So the appetite is there, but it's there at a price and it's there at a point that makes sense to us economically. So with that, let me turn it over to John Doucette and have him add some color as well."

And in terms of property, we did see rate increases in the U.S., 5% to 10%; in retro, 10% to 15%. And really, it was a question of how we allocated the book and where we decided to deploy the capacity. And so number one, where do we decide to deploy the capacity? We also saw very good opportunities in the primary property space. So we deployed more capacity into both cat and to primary property quota share, which we like the risk/return on that opportunity. So that's number one. 
Number two, as noted, we have increased the AUM in Logan and continue to look for ways to increase that and look to have that continue to be a very strategic part of our volatility management, capital management. And that will help decrease the volatility that you're seeing.
And then number three, as Juan said, a lot of this is about diversification, diversification within the reinsurance, diversification by growing the insurance operations, so it's different lines, territories, products. And that will result in just a lower -- dollars may be flat but -- or even up a little bit, but as a percentage of overall gross premium, the percentage of our cat load could be lower."

And again, let me start, and then I'll ask John Doucette to jump in as well. I would say that on that 6% cat load that Mark was referring to, it's really a question of how we manage our exposure in the reinsurance book and really, what we have been doing, frankly, over the last 18 months or so, to make sure that we're in a better place, more profitable place, more sustainable place from a catastrophe standpoint. 
Again, I go back to what I said earlier. We like cat, but it has to be priced right, has to be managed correctly. You've seen a lot of things that we have done that have been frankly reflected in some of the catastrophe loss numbers that we've put out in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. 
We have moved up the higher attachment points. We're writing less aggregate programs. We're frankly writing a more profitable book, a more sustainable book. And so that's part of what you see there. 
The other part of that is our capital shield, our hedging strategy for the company. Logan certainly plays a role there. Our Kilimanjaro bonds certainly play a role there. And there's other things that we're doing at the same time. 
You will see that we grew AUM in our Logan book -- in our Logan vehicle to the beginning of this year, and that certainly helps us well in essentially protecting our net position within the company. But let me ask John Doucette to jump in and add some additional color."

So I don't think it's definitionally it used to go to Everest and now it goes to Logan. It's part of a holistic suite of both what we're doing on the growth side, capital management side and the hedging side, and it's part of that. But it's clearly a core part of this -- of how we're thinking capital management and volatility management going forward. 
But I mean we also saw -- as Juan said earlier, while we did increase limits on the gross portfolio in our property book across property cat, retro and pro rata, we did increase that because of the opportunity set. But we saw an increase in overall premium and a larger increase in expected dollar margin and percentage margin and an increase in the ROE. So part of it is how we're thinking of what we want to keep on our balance sheet and other parts of the balance sheet. 
But I do think it's more, I think, than your -- how you're focusing on it. It's more a function of the diversification. As a function of premium, it really has more to do with the diversification, the growth in the insurance operation as a percentage, the growth in reinsurance in different lines of business. We saw a lot of opportunities in casualty, continue to see opportunities in mortgage, professional liability, significant opportunities, in fact. And all of that is on the -- is growing the denominator of the 6% cat load that you're talking about. And I think that is driving it more than specifically in Logan or outside of Logan."

There's also the fact that we had some pretty large losses coming through in some of those years, whether it was wildfires, MGM, et cetera. And that's part of that.

And so I'd sort of close it out with just a little bit of color around the piece of your question that sort of looks to translate cedent underlying loss ratio to what we're experiencing. I mean look, the reserving process is based on our own loss activity. And I think there are clearly areas where you can draw a more direct connection, if you're talking about, for example, a quota share book. So in the cases where we're participating in a proportional fashion with our cedents and they're seeing social inflation, average claim sizes have increased on the casualty side or in the case of water damage, claims that are elevating property losses, that's going to be a more direct translation. 
Where I think that starts to break down though is when you start talking about treaty structures that are not a direct quota share participation. You can't always draw those direct lines, and so I'd be a little bit careful about that. But if you think about the things and the general trends that have affected primary insurers in the '15 to '18 on the casualty, sort of '16 to '19 in property, sort of the same drivers of loss that we are seeing in our book are the ones you're hearing from other companies.

And things that we look at, are there going to be other legal, regulatory, legislative type things that happen that we haven't seen yet, right?

Again, I think part of what you're seeing in that 6% cat load that Mark alluded to, it's essentially the end result of a lot of the management actions, the proactive underwriting actions that the team has taken really over the last 12 to 18 months to better improve and better manage the volatility of our portfolio. So you're definitely seeing that essentially come through at the same time. 
Now regarding the point on climate change, we are very mindful of that, right? So one of the things that our modeling does, particularly on the reinsurance division, is really look at the impact of rising sea temperatures that you can clearly see from 1995 onto  current. And based on that, we have adapted our modeling, we have updated our points of view on risk, on pricing to better be able to manage that. 
So all of that is essentially baked into that. But let me turn it over to John Doucette and let him add a little bit of color on that as well."

So 2 things we spend a lot of time thinking about in terms of how we manage the risk in our property portfolio. It's all the aspects of climate risk. We spend a lot of time looking at wildfire and frankly, derisking the wildfire exposure in our portfolio; spend a lot of time looking at the warm sea surface temperature, looking at droughts and the propensity for drought. So a lot of how we deploy capacity, what should the right attachments, products, terms, conditions and frankly, rate be looking at that. So number one is climate change. 
And number two, we've also been looking a lot at the different social inflation and risks that we've seen in the books, things like assignment of benefits to LAE, the increase in LAE that we've seen in different areas, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And so that's all factored into how we think about building the best portfolio, learning from the lessons that the industry is seeing and really positioning our book on a go-forward basis. 
And then also -- so it has some loss trends for the reasons I just mentioned, climate and some of the social issues. But it also -- we also are seeing the uplift that we're getting from improved rates, terms, conditions, occurrence clauses, hours clauses, et cetera, et cetera. So all of that is -- we have several countercurrents that result in the 6% you're looking at here."

So in -- it will vary by line, by territory, et cetera, by loss experience of the client. So one of -- there's been significant underlying rate improvement, terms and condition improvement on casualty and professional liability. And so our view is that the casualty reinsurance market was rational for the most part. Ceding commissions were about flat. But we did see an economic uplift at 1/1 just based on our exposure to the underlying terms and conditions. And then that would be very loss dependent. If somebody had bad -- poor loss experience, they could see a cut in the ceding commissions. 
And on property overall, we did see an improvement in the overall reinsurance terms and -- both in terms of like occurrence limits as well as ceding commissions. And I think that really was just a function of the overall capacity dearth on proportional reinsurance. So we were able to deploy and wanted to deploy more into that space."

Like I mentioned, we are the beneficiary of that for some of the things Juan mentioned earlier about ceding commissions that we gained by some of the portfolio mix in certain lines like specialty, casualty and other specialty lines like transactional and credit, political risk. 
So we tend to have really top talent in these areas, which I think have generated better terms and conditions for us and some more reinsurance. But I think as we continue the journey, we see opportunity, and we certainly think there's also opportunities for us to manage that more effectively."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest is off to a strong start in 2021 with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We achieved these results despite the meaningful impact to the industry of the U.S. winter storms in the first quarter. Our thoughts are with those affected by these storms as well as the Australian floods, and I am very proud of the work our claims team is doing on the ground to help people restore their lives.
Our first quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our success in implementing our strategy to build a broadly diversified company with a relentless focus on operational performance and disciplined underwriting. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the insurance segment, while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a leading global P&C reinsurer. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchises, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable us to thrive in today's market.
I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the group results, we grew gross written premiums by 14% and net written premiums by 16%, with robust growth across both segments. Our growth stems from: one, a combination of new business opportunities; two, improved terms and conditions; three, increased rate levels; four, expanded shares on attractive renewals; and five, high overall renewal retention.
The as-reported combined ratio was 98.1%, including the previously announced U.S. winter storms and the Australian flooding catastrophe losses. We generated $45 million in underwriting profit compared to $29 million in the first quarter last year. While the pandemic is not over, and as we have done in prior quarters, we completed a rigorous analysis of our COVID exposure in the first quarter, resulting in no change to our COVID loss provision. Our COVID loss provision remains at $511 million, of which approximately 80% is IBNR. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3%, a 2.5 point improvement over the first quarter of 2020, with both segments continuing to show significant year-over-year improvement in loss and expense ratios. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions. This includes managing attachment points and limits improving on terms and conditions and targeting nonrenewals of business, which does not meet our hurdle rates as well as many other actions. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. Net investment income was excellent at $260 million compared to $148 million in the prior year first quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $342 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. For our Reinsurance division, the first quarter continued our strong growth with gross written premiums up 16%, we were pleased with our successful execution of our January 1 renewal plan. The targeted and disciplined growth was driven by higher rate, increased shares on profitable deals, along with new opportunities in property, casualty, specialty lines and facultative business. The attritional combined ratio was 85.5% for the quarter, a 2.3 point improvement year-over-year. This came from improvement in both the loss and expense ratio. We saw better economics in most treaties and classes of business around the world. We were disciplined and reduced shares or non-renewed underperforming treaties or those where we did not get our target rate, terms, conditions, earnings or exclusions. We also deployed additional capacity into lines with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. This dynamic capital allocation resulted in an improved attritional combined ratio. 
Overall, we continue to write a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. With regard to the April 1 renewals, we achieved 10% to 15% rate increases on Japanese wind treaties and 5% rate increases in earthquake treaties. Rates in other geographies continued to rise in both property and casualty lines. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. 
Our insurance division continued its solid execution in the market, resulting in strong attritional underwriting performance and premium growth. Gross written premium grew 10%. If we exclude workers' compensation, where we see less attractive pricing, gross written premium grew 20%. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, ongoing strong rate increases in our target classes of business and high retention rates on existing business. We are also seeing a slow but steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in our target classes, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability and property short tail. We are happy with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. Everest insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 92.2% for the first quarter, a 2.7 point improvement over Q1 2020. These results continue to be driven by proactive underwriting actions and a continued focus on expense management. These actions are resulting in the continued expansion of our insurance margins. The attritional loss ratio of 64.3% improved 1.4 points year-over-year, and the total expense ratio improved 1.3 points year-over-year. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 16% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 10%, including workers' compensation. 
The increased rate we achieved and the expected increase in margin is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses. After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments remain necessary. We expect this favorable pricing to continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 33% D&O up 24%, property up 13% and commercial auto, up 13%. We are also seeing widespread rate increases in other lines of business. We are managing the insurance business to build a diversified portfolio, steering our mix to our product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. 
We also continue to manage average limits deployed to control volatility. We are happy with the progress we have made, and we expect that this strategic direction should possibly impact our results going forward. Conversely, we have been thoughtfully managing workers' compensation through the cycle. This portfolio now represents 14% of our first quarter premiums, down from 21% a year ago. We have pared back our writings in the monoline guaranteed cost base and shifted our portfolio to more loss sensitive loss ratable business. 
Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Apres and we are monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities. But these efforts illustrate the disciplined cycle management we have implemented in the company. Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continue to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. My Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. 
Everest had a strong start to 2021. With robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to customers. We have sustained momentum. This company has excellent financial strength, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe that the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategies will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest' future and in our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders.

Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment result. I'll touch on thes",776,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment result. I'll touch on these points over the next few minutes. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest reported net income of $342 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. We also reported operating income of $260 million for Q1 and operating earnings per share of $6.49. Starting with underwriting income, Everest had positive contributions from both reinsurance and insurance with $45.2 million of underwriting income. This reflects the improved underlying attritional loss and expense ratios, offset by the impact of catastrophe losses. The catastrophe losses of $260 million are pretax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $213 million in the reinsurance segment and $47 million in the insurance segment. The vast majority of $250 million is coming from the U.S. winter storms with the balance from the floods in New South Wales, Australia. Also worth noting is that we have not added to our COVID-19 loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with approximately 80% of our pandemic loss estimate remaining as IBNR. 
First quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and continue to improve. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio was 60.7% in Q1 compared to 61.4% in the first quarter of 2020. The attritional combined ratio was 87.3% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 89.8% for the first quarter last year, representing a 2.5 percentage point improvement for insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved from 65.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 64.3% this quarter. And the attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.2% and compared to 94.9% in the first quarter of 2020. 
Our U.S. insurance business, which makes up the majority of our overall insurance business continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. For reinsurance, the first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.5%, down from 59.8% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio on the same basis was 85.5%, down from 87.8%. The group commission ratio of 20.5% for the first quarter of 2021 and was down 150 basis points from 22% reported last year in Q1, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix, plus higher commissions received in the insurance segment. The group expense ratio remains low at 5.9% for the first quarter of 2021 versus 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management, plus economies of scale as our premium base continues to grow. 
First quarter investment income had an excellent result of $260 million as compared to $148 million for the first quarter 2020, and alternative investments recorded a quarterly record $120 million of income in the first quarter, largely due to increases in the net asset values from our portfolio of diversified private equity investments. Reflecting the strong economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. 
Invested assets grew approximately 2% to $25.9 billion during the quarter, up from $25.5 billion at year-end 2020, approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.5 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective tax rate on operating income for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9% and 8.4% on net income. This was favorable versus our planned effective tax rate of approximately 12%, largely due to the geographic distribution of the catastrophe losses occurring within the United States. For the first quarter of 2021, Everest generated strong operating cash flows of $904 million compared to $506 million for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong with the capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital, and ample capacity to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $9.7 billion at the end of the first quarter and broadly flat versus the $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. Our debt leverage ratio stands at 16.5%, and book value per share stood at $241.57 at quarter end. I close in noting that Everest repurchased approximately $24 million of common shares during the first quarter. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Juan."

And if we were to assume a 5% loss trend, that would have resulted in around 4 points of accident year underlying loss ratio improvement this quarter. And when we look at the insurance book and back out COVID, you produced just under 1.5 points. So is a good rule of thumb that you we get less than half of the improvement fall to the bottom line? And the other half you would use to build some reserve conservatism?"

Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan, also I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. #1 is, we had strong results across the board.

Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan, also I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. #1 is, we had strong results across the board. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's a 2.5 point improvement in the combined ratio year-over-year. When you look specifically at the insurance division, that's a 2.7% improvement that you're seeing there as well. That, frankly, is led by the loss ratio with a 1.4% improvement in the attritional loss ratio. Now the mechanics of that improvement, I think it's along the lines of what we've discussed in prior quarters. So certainly, we are seeing very good rate we saw, as I mentioned, 16% rate increases in the insurance book. In the first quarter, and that continues to do quite well. As -- fact that to put it in perspective, that 16% is 2x the rate that we achieved in all of 2019. So rate is part of that. But the bigger part of all of this is really the myriad of actions that we're taking on the underwriting side as I mentioned previously, to continue to position our book of business, both on the insurance side and the reinsurance side to have sustained profitability over the long term. And it's important to keep in mind 1 thing. Right? We're deliberately shifting to portfolios towards segments that have better overall economics in addition to all the underwriting actions that we're taking and that I've mentioned in the past and in my script, to continue to improve sustained profitability. 
Now when it comes to loss fix, I think it's also important to keep in mind that we continue to hold the line on loss picks, we have clear indications that underlying profitability is continuing to improve. Some of that you saw in this quarter's results. And some of that will need to be proven over time as the accident years continue to mature. So I think that's probably the best guidance that I can give you on that. And with that, let me ask also 1 of my colleagues, Jim Williamson to jump into this question as well."

But we've also talked over the last few years about the fact that the trend line has been accelerating in terms of whether it's social inflation, inflation and building costs in terms of repair after natural disasters and things of that nature. And so that does 2 things. One, it will certainly consume a little bit more of the rate increases, and we want to be prudent about that. That's, I would say, a smaller effect. The larger effect, though, is the degree that, that places uncertainty around what the ultimate trend line will turn out to be, which is why we're going to take a very conservative position around making sure that we've proven out our trend selections over time, which would ultimately allow us to be looking on these accident years more favorably, but it's going to take time for that to fully mature."

I'm looking at your consolidated expense ratio was around 26.4%, I think, in the quarter. And so in line with the levels that you guys saw in the second half of last year, but well below where you were pre COVID. So just trying to get a sense of what kind of -- obviously, there is the commission and brokerage ratio and also the other underwriting expenses. But just trying to get a sense of where the expense ratio should level out once we're kind of through with COVID? And what's kind of a run rate level there?"

I think it's important, I think, as you were describing just now to decompose the parts of the expense ratio.

I think it's important, I think, as you were describing just now to decompose the parts of the expense ratio. I think if we look at the operating expense ratio, that 5.9%, I think that 5.96%, et cetera, it's going to be pretty consistent. For us. One of the things that you know about Everest in our company is our disciplined expense management, whether it's COVID or no COVID. The reality is we're pretty focused on being efficient. So I would expect that the operating expense ratio would be relatively consistent with those numbers that you have been seeing. The commission ratio is going to fluctuate based on the type of business that we're writing in any given quarter. Right? 
And so for instance, if you're writing on the primary insurance business, lines that are growing faster, but you're getting better seeds because of our reinsurance structure, that obviously will have an impact. On the reinsurance side, obviously, the business mix that we write at the 1/1 renewals will also have an impact on that. But let me ask Mark Kociancic to weigh in on that as well."

I think that expense run rate is going to be hovering around that 6 points. You might see some quarterly volatility. But in general, that's roughly the area I would expect it to go, there could be a waiting differential depending on the growth rate of insurance, which comes with a higher general expense, operating rate versus the reinsurance division. And then the other piece that I would just highlight is we are having fairly strong net earned premium growth as we develop both franchises even more. So these are things we're all keeping an eye on. So I wouldn't get caught up in quarterly volatility, but that run rate of 6% is a pretty good bogey."

We've been spending a lot of time with the first quarter earnings calls talking about the concept of rate adequacy. And I was hoping you could give us your thoughts on just the proportion of business that feels rate adequate or the extent to which we're reaching rate adequacy and pricing momentum may start to decelerate. And of course, the offset to that could be exposure growth as the global economy starts to recover in the back half of the year? And overall, what this could mean for potential top line growth?  I mean, it's more of an insurance question than reinsurance question, but appreciate whatever color you have."

Let me start with the top line growth question, and then we'll come back to the margin expansion point that we've had. As I mentioned in my commentary in his script, one of the things that we're starting to see is a slow and steady return of exposure growth. Is starting to get near pre pandemic levels. And I think that's something that -- as well as the economic recovery is consistent. You're going to continue to see probably for the back half of the year. So I think that obviously bodes well for the insurance industry as we are features of an economy and as there's more to ensure, there's more opportunity for growth. So I think, again, in the back half of the year, if exposure growth continues, you're going to see improvement in that. With regard to rate adequacy, et cetera, we have been seeing rate exceeding our expectations for loss cost trend now for a number of quarters. And obviously, it's going to vary by line of business. But you are starting to see where the majority of your lines of business are rate adequate at this point in time. Now that being said, it's important to also keep in mind that starting, particularly for some of the longer tail lines such a general liability excess and maybe some of the D&O lines, where they may be needed more rate as an industry over time. And we're starting to catch up, and we're starting to get there. Now what you see in our numbers, frankly, is that we have that steady improvement of underlying profitability continuing to improve. As I just mentioned to Elyse a few minutes ago, we are holding the line on our loss picks. We expect that over time, we will be bringing that to the bottom line. But all of that bodes very well for expected margin growth over time. But let me also ask Jim Williamson to weigh in on this question."

Look, the first thing I would say is we like workers' compensation. And we're experts at it at Everest. But we're also disciplined underwriters. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we see better pricing opportunities in other lines of business right now. Property, D&O, specialty casualty, those kinds of things. As I also mentioned, we're still writing comp. We're just changing the type of comp that we're writing going forward. Where we see less attractive pricing right now, it's in the monoline workers' compensation space. So as a result of that, we have really shifted more towards loss ratable, loss sensitive business at that point. But as I also mentioned in my remarks, we are very much looking for the opportunities as the economy begins to heal. And as things begin to improve, we will see an improvement in exposures also in the workers' compensation line for us. And when we see the opportunity and the pricing improving, firms improving exposure is beginning to grow, you will see us start to deploy more capital into workers' compensation as well. But look, this is how we're managing this company proactively presumptively to focus on lines with better rate adequacy, with better opportunities for growth and with better margin. But again, we like comp. We're just taking a pause on it right now from the perspective of monoline until we see conditions begin to improve. But with that, let me ask Mike Karm to jump in."

We've been basically focusing the composition of the portfolio, really around low and moderate type hazard risk. And so we feel very good about where we are, and we are starting to see signs, particularly outside of California, where rate is starting to go up and nudge up and then in California, we are seeing it starting to bottom out. But we're optimistic that, that towards the end of the year should start to change in California. And that opportunity presents itself, you'll see us certainly continue to gain some market share."

My comments about holding the line on loss picks really pretty straightforward. It's the fact, and I've been pretty consistent in this messaging over the last number of quarters. In this business, you've got to wait for things to season out over time. And so in the meantime, it's not just about rate. It's about all those actions that we're taking on the underwriting side, portfolio management, limit management, attachment points, et cetera, to continue to improve the profitability and the quality of your book, and that is what you're seeing. Those are the numbers that are being reflected not only in this quarter but in the last several quarters as well. And so going forward, we do believe we're building expected margin in those lines.

And as I mentioned to Elyse earlier in the call, the 16% is very good. Continued significant momentum on the rate side of things. Business mix certainly will influence that. The type of business that you write in a particular quarter for instance, in this case, if it's more heavily weighted towards a property, a short line type exposure, that carries a certain rate, that's certainly going to impact the mix. Now if I elevate the answer to your question and basically then talk more about the industry and look across companies, I think, again, business mix plays a part of that. I think execution plays a part of that, right? I think 1 of the most important things about our primary insurance business, and I talk about it often. I'm very proud of them, is how well they execute in the market. So I would say business mix is part of that. Execution is part of that. Portfolio management and how you look at risk is certainly part of that. And ultimately, risk selection, which is a component of that. I think those are all the things that essentially go into play. But look, speaking from our perspective at Everest, we expect continued momentum and strong renewal rate growth throughout 2021."

I mean, obviously, we're well aware of the top line number for our insurance division, for example. But we really do look at it a much more granular level because of all the reasons that want cited and at the end of the day, we've got underwriters. They have -- they're approaching the market in a very disciplined fashion. But they're selecting 1 deal at a time. They're focused on making sure they underwrite the deal appropriately that they attach the right terms and conditions to drive a total margin outcome. And so it's really only at that level that the numbers are truly meaningful. So I'd just be careful about reading too much into the fact that there's variation across firms."

Specifically to the dollars being up in the quarter on the reinsurance segment, I think a lot of that is, frankly, noise. As Mark said earlier, there's always going to be a bit of volatility in the expense ratio from quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that. But as both Mark and I said earlier, when you think about the operating expense ratio trajectory, that 2.93 in is probably a good number for reinsurance.

And I think you're getting into psychology now, Meyer, not insurance and reinsurance economics. But look, I think from my perspective, there's a number of things that might be slightly different, right? If you look at the underlying conditions that drove the need for rate, right? So a number of years of soft pricing, inadequate pricing, inadequate rates, et cetera, that finally began to turn, as you had the impact of the catastrophes in '17, '18, '19, as you had the impact of social inflation coming through now we have the impact of the COVID pandemic and the correlated impact on both the asset and the liability side of the business. So all of these things are at play. Right. And I think what you have found is that people have achieved some level of discipline. And you're hearing it from us certainly. You have certainly heard it from our peers, particularly on the reinsurance side. That they've all approached the 1/1 renewals with a level of discipline, frankly, from some of our competitors that may be we haven't seen that level of discipline in the past. So I'm an optimist, and I think that some of that will continue as we go forward. There's also been capital that's coming in into the market and to the industry. But that capital has only been impacting on the margins and nibbling on the edges. It has not been a significant amount of capital. So look, I think you still have some of the underlying factors that drove the need for rate. Rates aren't getting more adequate, as I mentioned earlier.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Everest is off to a strong start in 2021 with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We achieved these results despite the meaningful impact to the industry of the U.S. winter storms in the first quarter. Our thoughts are with those affected by these storms as well as the Australian floods, and I am very proud of the work our claims team is doing on the ground to help people restore their lives.
Our first quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of Everest and our success in implementing our strategy to build a broadly diversified company with a relentless focus on operational performance and disciplined underwriting. We are bullish about 2021. We will continue to profitably grow the insurance segment, while continuing to grow and strengthen our position as a leading global P&C reinsurer. Our diversified reinsurance and insurance franchises, financial strength, deep distribution relationships and leading customer solutions enable us to thrive in today's market.
I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the group results, we grew gross written premiums by 14% and net written premiums by 16%, with robust growth across both segments. Our growth stems from: one, a combination of new business opportunities; two, improved terms and conditions; three, increased rate levels; four, expanded shares on attractive renewals; and five, high overall renewal retention.
The as-reported combined ratio was 98.1%, including the previously announced U.S. winter storms and the Australian flooding catastrophe losses. We generated $45 million in underwriting profit compared to $29 million in the first quarter last year. While the pandemic is not over, and as we have done in prior quarters, we completed a rigorous analysis of our COVID exposure in the first quarter, resulting in no change to our COVID loss provision. Our COVID loss provision remains at $511 million, of which approximately 80% is IBNR.
The attritional combined ratio was 87.3%, a 2.5 point improvement over the first quarter of 2020, with both segments continuing to show significant year-over-year improvement in loss and expense ratios. We continue to diligently manage our portfolios to improve returns with a broad array of underwriting actions. This includes managing attachment points and limits, improving on terms and conditions and targeting nonrenewals of business, which does not meet our hurdle rates as well as many other actions. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do.
Net investment income was excellent at $260 million compared to $148 million in the prior year first quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $342 million resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%.
For our Reinsurance division, the first quarter continued our strong growth with gross written premiums up 16%. We were pleased with our successful execution of our January 1 renewal plan. The targeted and disciplined growth was driven by higher rate, increased shares on profitable deals along with new opportunities in property, casualty, specialty lines and facultative business.
The attritional combined ratio was 85.5% for the quarter, a 2.3 point improvement year-over-year. This came from improvement in both the loss and expense ratio. We saw better economics in most treaties and classes of business around the world. We were disciplined and reduced shares or non-renewed underperforming treaties for those where we did not get our target rate, terms, conditions, writings or exclusions. We also deployed additional capacity into lines with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. This dynamic capital allocation resulted in an improved attritional combined ratio.
Overall, we continue to write a stronger, more diversified and more profitable book. With regard to the April 1 renewals, we achieved 10% to 15% rate increases on Japanese wind treaties and 5% rate increases in earthquake treaties. Rates in other geographies continued to rise in both property and casualty lines. John Doucette is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
Our insurance division continued its solid execution in the market, resulting in strong attritional underwriting performance and premium growth. Gross written premium grew 10%. If we exclude workers' compensation, where we see less attractive pricing, gross written premium grew 20%. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, ongoing strong rate increases in our target classes of business and high retention rates on existing business.
We are also seeing a slow but steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in our target classes, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability and property short tail. We are happy with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy.
Everest insurance delivered an improved attritional combined ratio of 92.2% for the first quarter, a 2.7 point improvement over Q1 2020. These results continue to be driven by proactive underwriting actions and a continued focus on expense management. These actions are resulting in the continued expansion of our insurance margins.
The attritional loss ratio of 64.3% improved 1.4 points year-over-year, and the total expense ratio improved 1.3 points year-over-year. Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 16% in the quarter excluding workers' compensation, and up 10% including workers' compensation. The increased rate we achieved and the expected increase in margin is a function of market conditions and disciplined proactive underwriting actions across our businesses.
After years of soft pricing and rising loss costs, pricing adjustments remain necessary. We expect this favorable pricing to continue throughout 2021. Consistent with prior quarters, rate increases were led by excess casualty up 33%, D&O up 24%, property up 13% and commercial auto up 13%. We are also seeing widespread rate increases in other lines of business.
We are managing the insurance business to build a diversified portfolio, steering our mix to our product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continue to manage average limits deployed to control volatility. We are happy with the progress we have made, and we expect that this strategic direction should possibly impact our results going forward.
Conversely, we have been thoughtfully managing workers' compensation through the cycle. This portfolio now represents 14% of our first quarter premiums, down from 21% a year ago. We have pared back our writings in the monoline guaranteed cost base and shifted our portfolio to more loss sensitive loss ratable business. Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Everest, and we are monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities. But these efforts illustrate the disciplined cycle management we have implemented in the company.
Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continue to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
Everest had a strong start to 2021, with robust growth, strong overall profitability, continued improvement in attritional underwriting margins and excellent investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to customers. We have sustained momentum. This company has excellent financial strength, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy.
We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe that the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategies will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest's future and in our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?"

Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment result. I'll touch on thes",772,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest had very attractive results for the first quarter of 2021, with strong overall profitability, continued improving underlying margins, robust growth and an excellent investment result. I'll touch on these points over the next few minutes.
For the first quarter of 2021, Everest reported net income of $342 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 15%. We also reported operating income of $260 million for Q1 and operating earnings per share of $6.49. Starting with underwriting income, Everest had positive contributions from both reinsurance and insurance with $45.2 million of underwriting income. This reflects the improved underlying attritional loss and expense ratios, offset by the impact of catastrophe losses.
The catastrophe losses of $260 million are pretax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $213 million in the reinsurance segment and $47 million in the insurance segment. The vast majority of $250 million is coming from the U.S. winter storms with the balance from the floods in New South Wales, Australia. Also worth noting is that we have not added to our COVID-19 loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with approximately 80% of our pandemic loss estimate remaining as IBNR.
First quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional loss and combined ratios are strong and continue to improve. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio was 60.7% in Q1 compared to 61.4% in the first quarter of 2020.
The attritional combined ratio was 87.3% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 89.8% for the first quarter last year, representing a 2.5 percentage point improvement. For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved from 65.7% in the first quarter of 2020 to 64.3% this quarter. And the attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.2% compared to 94.9% in the first quarter of 2020. Our U.S. insurance business, which makes up the majority of our overall insurance business continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s.
For reinsurance, the first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.5%, down from 59.8% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio on the same basis was 85.5%, down from 87.8%. The group commission ratio of 20.5% for the first quarter of 2021 was down 150 basis points from 22% reported last year in Q1, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix plus higher commissions received in the insurance segment.
The group expense ratio remains low at 5.9% for the first quarter of 2021 versus 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management plus economies of scale as our premium base continues to grow.
First quarter investment income had an excellent result of $260 million as compared to $148 million for the first quarter 2020. Alternative investments recorded a quarterly record $120 million of income in the first quarter, largely due to increases in the net asset values from our portfolio of diversified private equity investments, reflecting the strong economy and financial markets. As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears.
Invested assets grew approximately 2% to $25.9 billion during the quarter, up from $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well diversified, high-credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.5 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments.
Our effective tax rate on operating income for the first quarter of 2021 was 7.9% and 8.4% on net income. This was favorable versus our planned effective tax rate of approximately 12%, largely due to the geographic distribution of the catastrophe losses occurring within the United States.
For the first quarter of 2021, Everest generated strong operating cash flows of $904 million compared to $506 million for the first quarter of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong with the capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital, and ample capacity to execute on market opportunities.
Shareholders' equity was $9.7 billion at the end of the first quarter and broadly flat versus the $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. Our debt leverage ratio stands at 16.5%, and book value per share stood at $241.57 at quarter end. I close in noting that Everest repurchased approximately $24 million of common shares during the first quarter.
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon."

And when we look at the insurance book and back out COVID, you produced just under 1.5 points. So is a good rule of thumb that you would get less than half of the improvement fall to the bottom line and the other half you would use to build some reserve conservatism?"
340813,709199062,2262692,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan. I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one is, we had strong results across the board. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's a 2.5 point improvement in the combined ratio year-over-year. When you",354,"Yes. Thanks, Elyse, and this is Juan. I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. Number one is, we had strong results across the board. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's a 2.5 point improvement in the combined ratio year-over-year. When you look specifically at the insurance division, that's a 2.7% improvement that you're seeing there as well that frankly is led by the loss ratio with a 1.4% improvement in the attritional loss ratio.
Now the mechanics of that improvement, I think it's along the lines of what we've discussed in prior quarters. So certainly, we are seeing very good rate. We saw, as I mentioned, 16% rate increases in the insurance book. In the first quarter, and that continues to do quite well. As Mark reported, put it in perspective, that 16% is 2x the rate that we achieved in all of 2019. So rate is part of that. But the bigger part of all of this is really the myriad of actions that we're taking on the underwriting side, as I mentioned previously, to continue to position our book of business, both on the insurance side and the reinsurance side to have sustained profitability over the long term.
And it's important to keep in mind one thing, right? We're deliberately shifting to portfolios towards segments that have better overall economics in addition to all the underwriting actions that we're taking and that I've mentioned in the past and in my script to continue to improve sustained profitability. 
Now when it comes to loss picks, I think it's also important to keep in mind that we continue to hold the line on loss picks. We have clear indications that underlying profitability is continuing to improve. Some of that you saw in this quarter's results, and some of that will need to be proven over time as the accident years continue to mature. So I think that's probably the best guidance that I can give you on that.
And with that, let me ask also one of my colleagues, Jim Williamson, to jump into this question as well."
340813,709199062,2262692,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Elyse, the only thing I would add, and I think it's important both in insurance and reinsurance, and I suspect it's on the minds of everyone on the call today is just this question of the loss trend, and we talk about rate achievement exceeding the loss t",194,"Elyse, the only thing I would add, and I think it's important both in insurance and reinsurance, and I suspect it's on the minds of everyone on the call today is just this question of the loss trend, and we talk about rate achievement exceeding the loss trend. But we've also talked over the last few years about the fact that the trend line has been accelerating in terms of whether it's social inflation, inflation in building costs in terms of repair after natural disasters and things of that nature.
And so that does 2 things. One, it will certainly consume a little bit more of the rate increases, and we want to be prudent about that. That's, I would say, a smaller effect. The larger effect, though, is the degree that, that places uncertainty around what the ultimate trend line will turn out to be, which is why we're going to take a very conservative position around making sure that we've proven out our trend selections over time, which would ultimately allow us to be looking on these accident years more favorably, but it's going to take time for that to fully mature."

One of the things that you know about Everest, in our company, is our disciplined expense management. Whether it's COVID or no COVID, the reality is we're pretty focused on being efficient. So I would expect that the operating expense ratio would be relatively consistent with those numbers that you have been seeing.
The commission ratio is going to fluctuate based on the type of business that we're writing in any given quarter, right? And so for instance, if you're writing on the primary insurance business lines that are growing faster, but you're getting better cedes because of our reinsurance structure, that obviously will have an impact. On the reinsurance side, obviously, the business mix that we write at the 1/1 renewals will also have an impact on that. But let me ask Mark Kociancic to weigh in on that as well."

But in general, that's roughly the area I would expect it to go. There could be a weighting differential depending on the growth rate of insurance, which comes with a higher general expense operating rate versus the reinsurance division. And then the other piece that I would just highlight is we are having fairly strong net earned premium growth as we develop both franchises even more. So these are things we're all keeping an eye on. So I wouldn't get caught up in quarterly volatility, but that run rate of 6% is a pretty good bogey."

And I think that's something that -- as well as the economic recovery is consistent you're going to continue to see probably for the back half of the year. So I think that obviously bodes well for the insurance industry as we have features of an economy and as there's more to insure, there's more opportunity for growth. So I think, again, the back half of the year, if exposure growth continues, you're going to see improvement in that.
With regard to rate adequacy, et cetera, we have been seeing rate exceeding our expectations for loss cost trend now for a number of quarters. And obviously, it's going to vary by line of business. But you are starting to see where the majority of your lines of business are rate adequate at this point in time. Now that being said, it's important to also keep in mind that starting, particularly for some of the longer tail lines such as general liability excess and maybe some of the D&O lines, where they may be needed more rate as an industry over time, and we're starting to catch up, and we're starting to get there.

As I also mentioned, we're still writing comp. We're just changing the type of comp that we're writing going forward.

So as a result of that, we have really shifted more towards loss ratable, loss sensitive business at that point.

Juan, you mentioned the year-over-year improvement in the attritional loss ratio, the 64.3%. And you talked about how the loss trends are making things a little more cautious on your part. I guess, is that it? Is that why for the first time and over a year, we saw an increase in the loss pick from -- sequentially from the prior quarter? It's been coming down every quarter over quarter over quarter, and this quarter, it went up, from 4Q. Is that simply it because of your concerns on loss trends? Or is there anything else going on that would make your increases from 4Q?"

I would start with saying, look, the appropriate comparison is more of the year-over-year comparison than the sequential comparison, and that's going to be driven more by mix of business than anything else. So I think that's an important point. The second point that I would make is, look, we feel pretty good about the business that we're writing today, about the rate adequacy on that business and about the margin that we're building.
My comments about holding the line on loss picks are really pretty straightforward. It's the fact, and I've been pretty consistent in this messaging over the last number of quarters, in this business, you've got to wait for things to season out over time. And so in the meantime, it's not just about rate. It's about all those actions that we're taking on the underwriting side, portfolio management, limit management, attachment points, et cetera, to continue to improve the profitability and the quality of your book, and that is what you're seeing.
Those are the numbers that are being reflected not only in this quarter but in the last several quarters as well. And so going forward, we do believe we're building expected margin in those lines. And as we start getting more certainty on the fact that rate has indeed exceeded our trend expectations, that margin will start coming through the bottom line basically."

Look, starting with Everest, and as I mentioned to Elyse earlier in the call, the 16% is very good. It continued significant momentum on the rate side of things. Business mix certainly will influence that. The type of business that you write in a particular quarter. For instance, in this case, if it's more heavily weighted towards a property, a short line type exposure, that carries a certain rate, that's certainly going to impact the mix.
Now if I elevate the answer to your question and basically then talk more about the industry and look across companies, I think, again, business mix plays a part of that. I think execution plays a part of that, right? I think one of the most important things about our primary insurance business, and I talk about it often, I'm very proud of them, is how well they execute in the market.
So I would say business mix is part of that. Execution is part of that. Portfolio management and how you look at risk is certainly part of that. And ultimately, risk selection, which is a component of that, I think those are all the things that essentially go into play. But look, speaking from our perspective at Everest, we expect continued momentum and strong renewal rate growth throughout 2021."

But we really do look at it a much more granular level because of all the reasons that Juan cited.
And at the end of the day, we've got underwriters. They have -- they're approaching the market in a very disciplined fashion. But they're selecting 1 deal at a time. They're focused on making sure they underwrite the deal appropriately, that they attach the right terms and conditions to drive a total margin outcome. And so it's really only at that level that the numbers are truly meaningful. So I'd just be careful about reading too much into the fact that there's variation across firms."

If you recall, we grew that franchise by about 15%. So you are seeing the benefit of that coming through.
Specifically to the dollars being up in the quarter on the reinsurance segment, I think a lot of that is, frankly, noise. As Mark said earlier, there's always going to be a bit of volatility in the expense ratio from quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn't read too much into that. But as both Mark and I said earlier, when you think about the operating expense ratio trajectory, that 2.9%, 3% is probably a good number for reinsurance.

And I think you're getting into psychology now, Meyer, not insurance and reinsurance economics. But look, I think from my perspective, there's a number of things that might be slightly different, right? If you look at the underlying conditions that drove the need for rate, right, so a number of years of soft pricing, inadequate pricing, inadequate rates, et cetera, that finally began to turn, as you had the impact of the catastrophes in '17, '18, '19, as you had the impact of social inflation coming through. Now, you have the impact of the COVID pandemic and the correlated impact on both the asset and the liability sides of the business. So all of these things are at play, right?
And I think what you have found is that people have achieved some level of discipline. And you're hearing it from us certainly, you have certainly heard it from our peers, particularly on the reinsurance side, that they've all approached the 1/1 renewals with a level of discipline, frankly, from some of our competitors that may be we haven't seen that level of discipline in the past. So I'm an optimist, and I think that some of that will continue as we go forward.
There's also been capital that's coming in into the market and to the industry. But that capital has only been impacting on the margins and nibbling on the edges. It has not been a significant amount of capital. So look, I think you still have some of the underlying factors that drove the need for rate. Rates aren't getting more adequate, as I mentioned earlier. But again, there's still environmental issues that we all need to keep an eye on, particularly the more disciplined companies like Everest I think will be very focused on that going forward."

Everest delivered an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and excellent underwriting and investment performance. We set multiple records for our company on both the top and bottom lines. These results serve as the foundation for our exceptional net income result of over $1 billion through the first half of 2021. Another important step to we're achieving our 3-year strategic play objectives and the delivery of superior results to our shareholders. Everest achieved an annualized total shareholder return of 22.5% through the first half of 2021, while exceeding our 3-year strategic plan target of 13%. We capitalized on market opportunities to expand our franchises in both reinsurance and insurance, driven by relentless execution and the strength of our value proposition to our clients and brokers. Disciplined underwriting drove strong profitability in both reinsurance and insurance, and our investment return was a quarterly record for the company. 
The standout performance this quarter demonstrate the progress we have made in executing our strategy and the quality of Everest diversified earnings. 
As I discussed at our Investor Day in June, our strategy has 3 building blocks. First is building our underwriting franchises. We are growing our specialty P&C insurance platform while expanding its margins. We are solidifying our leadership position in global P&C reinsurance, while we are growing and diversifying this business. Our investment portfolio portfolio is a core tool to generate solid returns, and we're optimizing the portfolio while sharpening our strategy. 
Second, we continuously pursue operational excellence. This starts with underwriting discipline, supported by a system of management oversight and checks and balances. Beyond underwriting, we are transforming the operating model of the company to achieve greater scalability over time. We are also optimizing capital within our underwriting and investment portfolios. Capital is valued and respected. We are using the most efficient sources of underwriting capital from the capital markets, including an ILS investors. 
In our industry, those who execute best win. We're leveraging our flat, agile organization to deliver best-in-class service and risk solutions to our brokers and customers. They routinely site our responsiveness and capabilities as a key reason why they choose to do more business with Everest. 
Finally, ESG principles are core to Everest. This includes focusing on the culture our company. Culture is one of our key differentiators, and it is one of the reasons we can attract and keep top talent. Our culture fuels our success by helping our team be the best it can possibly be. We're investing in the talent of the organization as well as the diversity of our team. At Everest, we have 3 drivers of earnings.
The first driver is about building a high-quality specialty commercial P&C insurer, the underwriting excellence and a compelling value proposition. We are embedding data and analytics across the organization, enabling more effective pricing and decision-making. This means we make better underwriting decisions at improved loss ratios. We are improving our claims outcomes while delivering excellent service to our clients, and we're focusing our distribution efforts to be more sales and results oriented. 
Our second driver of earnings is Everest leading global P&C reinsurance platform. We enjoy the leading market position of a fully scaled platform, and we are focused on continuing to grow and optimize our reinsurance business. We're executing an underwriting transformation by improving operational oversight, governance and controls. Our reinsurance division is entrepreneurial and nimble. We will maintain it within a framework of pricing, reserving and process discipline. We're further diversifying into higher-margin opportunities. And finally, we're expanding our risk financing by further partnering with capital markets and ILS investors.
The third core driver of earnings is the investment portfolio. We have a high-quality portfolio, and we're focused on the efficient use of capital. The successful execution of our strategies and all 3 drivers of earnings is clearly evident in our results. 
I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the group results. We grew gross written premiums by 35% and net written premiums by 39%. Our growth was broad and diversified, stemming from 1 increased exposures and new business opportunities as the U.S. economy recovers; 2, continued double-digit rate increases; 3, expanded shares on attractive renewals; and four, strong renewal retention. The combined ratio was 89.3%, an 8-point improvement year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.6%, almost a 4 points better than prior year, with both segments expanding margins. We generated $274 million in underwriting profit compared to $51 million in the second quarter last year. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. 
Net investment income was simply outstanding at $407 million, compared to $38 million in the prior year second quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $680 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of over 28%. Gross written premiums in reinsurance were up 40% over the second quarter of 2020. We are pleased with the ongoing execution of our 2021 plan. This growth was broad-based in the areas we discussed during Investor Day as attractive. We achieved this growth while also coming off or reducing shares on less attractive business. We drove continued targeted growth in property cap, which we achieved while lowering our PMLs in peak zones, thus reducing expected volatility and improving risk-adjusted economics.
Much of our growth came from our core trading partners that are looking to grow with Everest because of our strong ratings and balance sheet, significant capacity and the ability to ride across all lines. The attritional combined ratio, ex COVID-19 pandemic impacts was 86.1% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, resulting from our continued focus on loss and expense management. We see risk-adjusted returns, expanding in almost all treaties and classes of business globally. We're also benefiting from investments in data and analytics. As you can see in our results, our focused actions improve the quality and profitability of the book. We are writing a more balanced portfolio with improved economics at an appropriate level of risk. We have achieved improved portfolio economics across all of our 2021 property renewal dates. We improved in every dimension. We increased top line, increased margin and achieved higher ROES. In casualty and professional lines, primary rate increases continue to outpace expected loss trends. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. 
Our insurance division continued its strong performance with excellent growth in underwriting results. We continue to expand margins as we execute our strategy. We wrote over $1 billion in gross written premiums for the first time in a quarter. This represents 25% growth year-over-year or 30% growth, excluding workers' compensation. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, continued double-digit rate increases and strong renewal retention on existing business. We're also starting to see a steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in target classes of business, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability, property, transactional liability and trade credit and political risk. We are pleased with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy. 
We also delivered strong underwriting results with a 93.5% combined ratio, a 10-point improvement over the same period last year, which was impacted by COVID. The underlying performance was also excellent with a 92.1% attritional combined ratio, a 1.6% improvement over last year and almost 4 points better than the second quarter of 2019. 
Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 14% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 11%, including workers' compensation. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 22%; property, up 16%; financial lines, up 14% and general liability, up 9%. We are building a diversified portfolio, steering our mix towards product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continue to manage average limits deployed to mitigate volatility.
We are pleased with the progress we have made. And this strategic direction and granular portfolio management should continue to possibly impact our results going forward. We continue to thoughtfully manage the workers' compensation line, which now represents 10% of our second quarter premiums, down from 14% year-over-year. While this line remains profitable, we have paired back monoline guaranteed cost writings and shifted to more loss sensitive loss ratable business, where we share more risk with our customers with more focus on risk mitigation. Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Everest, and we're monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate our disciplined cycle management. 
Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continues to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
In summary, Everest had an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and exceptional underwriting and investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. We have significant momentum as we continue to execute our strategic plan. The company has excellent financial strength, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategy will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest future and our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders. 
Now let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?"
340813,718896195,2354027,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021, with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns.

Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021, with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns. I'll provide more detail on these points over the next few minutes. 
For the second quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion, representing 35% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 40% to $2.1 billion and insurance reported its first-ever $1 billion top line quarter, representing 25% growth year-over-year. 
Turning to net income. For the second quarter, Everest reported net income of $680 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 28%. We also reported net operating income of $587 million, equal to operating earnings of $14.63 per share and an annualized operating return on equity of 24.5%. All 3 of our earnings engines provided meaningful contributions with significant underwriting income from both our reinsurance and insurance franchises, capped off by net investment income of $407 million, a record quarterly net investment income result. 
The underwriting income during the quarter of $274 million reflects Everest's disciplined execution of our strategy to grow and expand margins. The combined ratio was 89.3% for the quarter, compared to 97.5% last year. 
Catastrophe losses during the quarter of $45 million are pretax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $35 million in the reinsurance segment and $10 million in the insurance segment, representing additional IBNR provisions for winter Storm URI. Reinsurance segment cat loss includes a provision for minor events and preliminary IBNR for the European convective storms of late June. 
Finally, I note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional profitability remains strong during the second quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.3% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 60% in the second quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.5% compared with 60.7% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% for the second quarter compared to 88.5% for the second quarter of 2020, representing a 0.9 point improvement. 
Year-to-date, attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.4% compared with 89.1% a year ago, representing a 1.7 point improvement. For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved to 64.2% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with 65.1% year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.1% as compared to 93.7% over the same period of time. 
Our U.S. insurance business, which makes up the majority of our insurance business overall continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. For reinsurance, the second quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.1% compared with 58.2% a year ago. The increase was due to a mix of business shift and more prudent initial loss picks. The attritional combined ratio was 86.1% for the second quarter, down from 86.7% for the second quarter of 2020. The group commission ratio of 21.8% for the second quarter of 2021 was down 100 basis points from 22.8% reported in Q2 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix. The expense ratio remained low at 5.5% for the quarter as compared with 5.8% reported a year ago, and the expense ratio continues to benefit with our continued focus on expense management and the increased scale and efficiency of our operating model. 
For the second quarter, investment income had an exceptional result of $407 million as compared to $38 million for Q2 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $266 million of income during the second quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments. And as a reminder, we report our LP income 1 quarter in arrears. And in 2020, the market and the world were starting to experience the impact of COVID-19, while so far, in 2021, results continue to benefit from economic and financial markets recovery. Invested assets at the end of the second quarter totaled $27.1 billion compared to $21.6 billion at the end of Q2 2020 and $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.6 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other investment assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. 
Our effective tax rate on operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 9.3% and 10.6% on net income. This was a favorable variance versus our estimated tax rate of approximately 11% based on the geographic distribution of income. For the first 6 months of 2021, Everest generated a record $1.6 billion of operating cash flow, compared to $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter 2021, compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. We repurchased $16.8 million of shares in the quarter. Our debt leverage ratio is 13.3% or approximately 15.5% inclusive of our $310 million short-term loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Book value per share was $260.32 at the end of the second quarter compared with $241.57 at the end of Q1 2021, reflecting dividend adjusted growth of 8.4%, and I'll close with 1 final number. 
The total shareholder return or TSR target that we detailed in our Investor Day a few weeks ago. Recall that TSR is defined as the annual growth in book value per share, excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity investments plus dividends per share. And for the year-to-date, the TSR number is 22.5% annualized. And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon."

I mean the first thing I would say, and this is very consistent with the way we've described our value proposition and our strength in the market. And that's that we're very nimble in this market. We have portfolios and markets around the world across many lines of business, and we look to trade into those various areas to maximize our total economic returns. And that was certainly the case in the second quarter, and you see it in terms of some of our line of business growth, where areas like pro rata casualty were up 64%, just incredible results. We saw a lot of great opportunities to expand participation with some of our core partners, and we took advantage of that. 
Conversely, property cat XOL, which is a line of business where we have a big appetite for. It's a very attractive line grew at 17%. So an excellent result, but obviously lower growth, and that's aligned with a very low attritional loss ratio. And so mix is absolutely going to play a factor there, and it's going to bounce around from quarter-to-quarter depending on where we see opportunities emerging in the market. So those trades very successful outcome for our company. 
And then the next piece around loss picks. And again, a lot of consistency from us on this topic is we set very prudent loss picks. And in particular, if you think about the environment we're trading in with inflation, social inflation, the reopening from COVID, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market and particularly in some of the longer tail lines like casualty pro rata where we're growing, our view is we really need to see the results of rate change and the results of underwriting actions by our cedents to play through and mature in our book. And so you will expect, as we see those results come through, we'll certainly be sharing those results, but it will take time given the nature of our business for that to prove itself."

But also keep in mind what's going on in the environment because I think this goes directly to your question on expected margin. And we are confident based on all our metrics that we're looking at, that we are building future expected margin, not only in reinsurance but also in insurance. We're still seeing rate exceeding expected loss costs. From my prepared remarks, you heard about the improvement in economics that we have seen across the board in our renewals last year and this year, particularly in reinsurance. We're basically increasing our margins while lowering our exposure. And again, I point you to the fact that an 85% combined ratio for the year on an attritional basis for reinsurance is excellent."

I mean, our comp business is still very profitable. And I stated that also in our prepared remarks. But we are mindful of how we deploy capital. And we do see that pricing has flattened in workers' compensation at this point. Actually in June, we saw it go positive for the first time. So we're looking at that closely and see if that's a harbinger of things to come. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we like the comp business. But we're also smart about how we deploy capital. And we're seeing, frankly, better return opportunities right now in other lines of business, which I quoted in my remarks, where we're seeing significant rate across the board. But we are starting to see not only the flattening, but again, I would point to the fact that in June, we also started to see positive rate across the board. But let me ask Mike Karmilowicz to give you some additional color."

You also see are slowing down ultimately in our comp as far as the first quarter or second quarter. we're starting to see some changes there. So we feel that there's going to be some change in the marketplace, particularly in California. Keep in mind, too, with California, some of the reports that just came out from some of the organizations around some of the underlying costs, we've noticed too that some of the overall costs that are associated with -- such as the reforms on pharmaceutical and other different things. California has performed actually better from a loss cost perspective of some of these things. So we think that by the end of the year and into next year, Mike, we'll see some of this start to benefit us, and you'll see us go after the business if that opportunity presents itself."

We're preferred because we're nimble because we're creative because we distribute authority to our teams, they make decisions, they move quickly. And we're benefiting from all of those things. And in this environment, I think, for cedents who are sophisticated about their buying they are absolutely looking to trade up in terms of the quality of their partners, and we benefit from that. And so what we're seeing on programs around the world is we are getting increased signings with our core partners. Because of our broad capabilities, we're also able to trade into deals with core partners that we may not have been on before. And then obviously, as they introduce new programs into the market, we're able to participate there as well. And so we find this to be a very favorable competitive environment that way."

And so that prudence really puts us in a strong position as things start to unwind, and you do see a little bit more activity in terms of litigation and things of that nature. We don't have to react the other way either. So that prudence, that consistency benefits us when you see these very short-term changes in loss trend.

It's a combination of terms, conditions, attachment points, limits, our cedents and because we do partner with very high-quality primary underwriters, they are absolutely aggressively addressing changing conditions in the underlying property market. And so I think it actually happens reasonably quickly. But again, and I hate to sound like a broken record on this. This is why we do maintain prudency in our loss picks because some of these things take time to unfold, and we want to make sure that they get proven out. 
The other piece that's important when we think about our own profitability in property pro rata is, obviously, loss pick is critical, but we also look at things like seating commission. And so we've seen improvements in terms there. And that allows us to get to a place where the overall economics are very attractive and which is why we're willing to grow the line."

And I think for sedans who think about their reinsurers as long-term partners, which really describes our core partners, the ones that we've grown with over the last couple of years. I think they're very balanced about that.

Please recall in -- I think it was last quarter's earnings call, where we talked about all the levers that we're using to improve the profitability and the margins in our insurance division, but also within reinsurance, right? So it's not just really about mix. It's also about the granular detail of managing the portfolio of making tough decisions on what accounts you stay on, where do you want to grow and being very purposeful about shaping the portfolio and being able to grow it. If I look back at what we have been able to do in the insurance division over the last 18 months, the numbers are pretty clear. We have been able to lower the attritional combined ratio by about 6 points over that period of time since really the end of 2019. And a lot of it has been these very presumptive actions on the lines of business that we choose to operate in, not operate in, et cetera. The example of workers' compensation that we talked about earlier to Mike's question, I think, is a perfect example of that, right? So that gives you a sense that while, yes, we have been prudent in our loss picks because we view the environment, as I said earlier, a temporary environment because of COVID with the frequency changes that we saw in that time.

Everest delivered an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and excellent underwriting and investment performance. We set multiple records for our company on both the top and bottom lines. These results serve as the foundation for our exceptional net income result of over $1 billion through the first half of 2021, and another important step to achieving our 3-year strategic plan objectives and the delivery of superior results to our shareholders.
Everest achieved an annualized total shareholder return of 22.5% through the first half of 2021, while exceeding our 3-year strategic planned target of 13%. We capitalized on market opportunities to expand our franchises in both reinsurance and insurance, driven by relentless execution and the strength of our value proposition to our clients and brokers. Disciplined underwriting drove strong profitability in both reinsurance and insurance, and our investment return was a quarterly record for the company. The standout performance this quarter demonstrate the progress we have made in executing our strategy and the quality of Everest's diversified earnings.
As I discussed at our Investor Day in June, our strategy has 3 building blocks. First is building our underwriting franchises. We are growing our specialty P&C insurance platform while expanding its margins. We are solidifying our leadership position in global P&C reinsurance, while we are growing and diversifying this business. Our investment portfolio is a core tool to generate solid returns, and we're optimizing the portfolio while sharpening our strategy.
Second, we continuously pursue operational excellence. This starts with underwriting discipline, supported by a system of management oversight and checks and balances. Beyond underwriting, we are transforming the operating model of the company to achieve greater scalability over time. We are also optimizing capital within our underwriting and investment portfolios. Capital is valued and respected. We are using the most efficient sources of underwriting capital from the capital markets, including ILS investors.
In our industry, those who execute best, win. We're leveraging our flat, agile organization to deliver best-in-class service and risk solutions to our brokers and customers. They routinely site our responsiveness and capabilities as a key reason why they choose to do more business with Everest.
Finally, ESG principles are core to Everest. This includes focusing on the culture our company. Culture is one of our key differentiators, and it is one of the reasons we can attract and keep top talent. Our culture fuels our success by helping our team be the best it can possibly be. We're investing in the talent of the organization as well as the diversity of our team. 
At Everest, we have 3 drivers of earnings. The first driver is about building a high-quality specialty commercial P&C insurer, the underwriting excellence and a compelling value proposition. We are embedding data and analytics across the organization, enabling more effective pricing and decision-making. This means we make better underwriting decisions at improved loss ratios. We are improving our claims outcomes while delivering excellent service to our clients, and we're focusing our distribution efforts to be more sales and results oriented.
Our second driver of earnings is Everest leading global P&C reinsurance platform. We enjoy the leading market position of a fully scaled platform, and we are focused on continuing to grow and optimize our reinsurance business. We're executing an underwriting transformation by improving operational oversight, governance and controls. Our reinsurance division is entrepreneurial and nimble. We will maintain it within a framework of pricing, reserving and process discipline. We're further diversifying into higher-margin opportunities. And finally, we're expanding our risk financing by further partnering with capital markets and ILS investors.
The third core driver of earnings is the investment portfolio. We have a high-quality portfolio, and we're focused on the efficient use of capital. The successful execution of our strategies in all 3 drivers of earnings is clearly evident in our results.
I will now discuss our group reinsurance and insurance first quarter 2021 results. Starting with the group results. We grew gross written premiums by 35% and net written premiums by 39%. Our growth was broad and diversified, stemming from: one, increased exposures and new business opportunities as the U.S. economy recovers; two, continued double-digit rate increases; three, expanded shares on attractive renewals; and four, strong renewal retention. The combined ratio was 89.3%, an 8-point improvement year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio was 87.6%, almost a 4 point better than prior year, with both segments expanding margins. We generated $274 million in underwriting profit compared to $51 million in the second quarter last year. Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do.
Net investment income was simply outstanding at $407 million, compared to $38 million in the prior year second quarter. These strong operating results led to a net income for the quarter of $680 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of over 28%. Gross written premiums in reinsurance were up 40% over the second quarter of 2020. We are pleased with the ongoing execution of our 2021 plan. This growth was broad-based in the areas we discussed during Investor Day as attractive. We achieved this growth while also coming off or reducing shares on less attractive business. We drove continued targeted growth in property cap, which we achieved while lowering our PMLs in peak zones, thus reducing expected volatility and improving risk-adjusted economics.
Much of our growth came from our core trading partners that are looking to grow with Everest because of our strong ratings and balance sheet, significant capacity and the ability to ride across all lines. The attritional combined ratio, ex COVID-19 pandemic impact was 86.1% for the quarter, a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, resulting from our continued focus on loss and expense management. We see risk-adjusted returns expanding in almost all treaties and classes of business globally. We're also benefiting from investments in data and analytics.
As you can see in our results, our focused actions improved the quality and profitability of the book. We are writing a more balanced portfolio with improved economics at an appropriate level of risk. We have achieved improved portfolio economics across all of our 2021 property renewal dates. We improved in every dimension. We increased top line, increased margin and achieved higher ROEs. In casualty and professional lines, primary rate increases continued to outpace expected loss trends. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
Our insurance division continued its strong performance with excellent growth in underwriting results. We continue to expand margins as we execute our strategy. We wrote over $1 billion in gross written premiums for the first time in a quarter. This represents 25% growth year-over-year or 30% growth, excluding workers' compensation. This growth is driven by disciplined cycle management, new business opportunities, continued double-digit rate increases and strong renewal retention on existing business. We're also starting to see a steady improvement in overall economic activity. The growth was well diversified in target classes of business, where market conditions are prime for profitable growth, including specialty casualty, professional liability, property, transactional liability and trade credit and political risk. We are pleased with this diversification as it is a core tenet of our strategy.
We also delivered strong underwriting results with a 93.5% combined ratio, a 10-point improvement over the same period last year, which was impacted by COVID. The underlying performance was also excellent with a 92.1% attritional combined ratio, a 1.6% improvement over last year and almost 4 points better than the second quarter of 2019.
Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 14% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 11%, including workers' compensation. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 22%; property, up 16%; financial lines, up 14% and general liability, up 9%. We are building a diversified portfolio, steering our mix towards product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. We also continued to manage average limits deployed to mitigate volatility.
We are pleased with the progress we have made. And this strategic direction and granular portfolio management should continue to possibly impact our results going forward. We continue to thoughtfully manage the workers' compensation line, which now represents 10% of our second quarter premiums, down from 14% year-over-year. While this line remains profitable, we have pared back monoline guaranteed cost writings and shifted to more loss sensitive loss ratable business, where we share more risk with our customers with more focus on risk mitigation. Workers' compensation is an area of expertise at Everest, and we're monitoring market conditions closely for potential opportunities, but these efforts illustrate our disciplined cycle management.
Lastly, our strong position in both the E&S and retail channels continues to give us access to a wide set of opportunities. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.
In summary, Everest had an outstanding second quarter with strong growth and exceptional underwriting and investment performance. We have vibrant and well-diversified reinsurance and insurance businesses with experienced leadership and underwriting teams providing industry-leading solutions to our customers. We have significant momentum as we continue to execute our strategic plan. The company has excellent financial strength, top talent and a prudent capital management philosophy. We are focused on sustained profitable growth, a more diversified, targeted and deliberate mix of business and superior risk-adjusted returns. We believe the relentless and disciplined execution of our strategy will result in maximizing shareholder returns. I am confident in Everest's future and our ability to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Mark Kociancic for additional details on the financials. Mark?"
340813,718896195,2354278,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021, with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns. I'll provide more detail on these points o",1028,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest reported excellent results for the second quarter of 2021, with robust premium growth, excellent underwriting results and truly outstanding investment returns. I'll provide more detail on these points over the next few minutes.
For the second quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.2 billion, representing 35% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, reinsurance grew 40% to $2.1 billion and insurance reported its first-ever $1 billion top line quarter, representing 25% growth year-over-year.
Turning to net income. For the second quarter, Everest reported net income of $680 million, resulting in an annualized return on equity of 28%. We also reported net operating income of $587 million, equal to operating earnings of $14.63 per share and an annualized operating return on equity of 24.5%. All 3 of our earnings engines provided meaningful contributions with significant underwriting income from both our reinsurance and insurance franchises, capped off by net investment income of $407 million, a record quarterly net investment income result.
The underwriting income during the quarter of $274 million reflects Everest's disciplined execution of our strategy to grow and expand margins. The combined ratio was 89.3% for the quarter, compared to 97.5% last year. Catastrophe losses during the quarter of $45 million are pretax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, with $35 million in the reinsurance segment and $10 million in the insurance segment, representing additional IBNR provisions for Winter Storm Uri. Reinsurance segment cat loss includes a provision for minor events and preliminary IBNR for the European convective storms of late June.
Finally, I note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. Second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the second quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.3% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 60% in the second quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.5% compared with 60.7% a year ago. The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% for the second quarter compared to 88.5% for the second quarter of 2020, representing a 0.9 point improvement.
Year-to-date, attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.4% compared with 89.1% a year ago, representing a 1.7 point improvement. For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved to 64.2% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with 65.1% year-over-year. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved to 92.1% as compared to 93.7% over the same period of time.
Our U.S. insurance business, which makes up the majority of our insurance business overall continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. For reinsurance, the second quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 59.1% compared with 58.2% a year ago. The increase was due to a mix of business shift and more prudent initial loss picks. The attritional combined ratio was 86.1% for the second quarter, down from 86.7% for the second quarter of 2020. The group commission ratio of 21.8% for the second quarter of 2021 was down 100 basis points from 22.8% reported in Q2 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix. The expense ratio remained low at 5.5% for the quarter as compared with 5.8% reported a year ago, and the expense ratio continues to benefit with our continued focus on expense management and the increased scale and efficiency of our operating model.
For the second quarter, investment income had an exceptional result of $407 million as compared to $38 million for Q2 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $266 million of income during the second quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments. And as a reminder, we report our LP income 1 quarter in arrears. And in 2020, the market and the world were starting to experience the impact of COVID-19, while so far, in 2021, results continue to benefit from economic and financial markets recovery.
Invested assets at the end of the second quarter totaled $27.1 billion compared to $21.6 billion at the end of Q2 2020 and $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 80% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.6 years. The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other investment assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments.
Our effective tax rate on operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was 9.3% and 10.6% on net income. This was a favorable variance versus our estimated tax rate of approximately 11% based on the geographic distribution of income. For the first 6 months of 2021, Everest generated a record $1.6 billion of operating cash flow, compared to $1.1 billion for the first half of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year.
Our balance sheet remains very strong with a capital structure that allows for the efficient deployment of capital and ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter 2021, compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. We repurchased $16.8 million of shares in the quarter. Our debt leverage ratio is 13.3% or approximately 15.5% inclusive of our $310 million short-term loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Book value per share was $260.32 at the end of the second quarter compared with $241.57 at the end of Q1 2021, reflecting dividend adjusted growth of 8.4%.
And I'll close with 1 final number. The total shareholder return or TSR target that we detailed in our Investor Day a few weeks ago, recall that TSR is defined as the annual growth in book value per share, excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity investments plus dividends per share. And for the year-to-date, the TSR number is 22.5% annualized.
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Jon."

I mean the first thing I would say, and this is very consistent with the way we've described our value proposition and our strength in the market, and that's that we're very nimble in this market. We have portfolios and markets around the world across many lines of business, and we look to trade into those various areas to maximize our total economic returns. And that was certainly the case in the second quarter, and you see it in terms of some of our line of business growth, where areas like pro rata casualty were up 64%, just incredible results. We saw a lot of great opportunities to expand participation with some of our core partners, and we took advantage of that.
Conversely, property cat XOL, which is a line of business where we have a big appetite for, it's a very attractive line, grew at 17%. So an excellent result, but obviously lower growth, and that's aligned with a very low attritional loss ratio. And so mix is absolutely going to play a factor there, and it's going to bounce around from quarter-to-quarter depending on where we see opportunities emerging in the market. So those trades very successful outcome for our company.
And then the next piece around loss picks. And again, a lot of consistency from us on this topic is we set very prudent loss picks. And in particular, if you think about the environment we're trading in with inflation, social inflation, the reopening from COVID, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market and particularly in some of the longer tail lines like casualty pro rata where we're growing, our view is we really need to see the results of rate change and the results of underwriting actions by our cedents to play through and mature in our book. And so you will expect, as we see those results come through, we'll certainly be sharing those results, but it will take time given the nature of our business for that to prove itself."

But also keep in mind what's going on in the environment because I think this goes directly to your question on expected margin. And we are confident based on all our metrics that we're looking at, that we are building future expected margin, not only in reinsurance, but also in insurance. We're still seeing rate exceeding expected loss costs. From my prepared remarks, you heard about the improvement in economics that we have seen across the board in our renewals last year and this year, particularly in reinsurance. We're basically increasing our margins while lowering our exposure. And again, I point you to the fact that an 85% combined ratio for the year on an attritional basis for reinsurance is excellent."

So that includes share buybacks, but that would be what I would call a secondary consideration.

We're starting to see some changes there. So we feel that there's going to be some change in the marketplace, particularly in California. Keep in mind too, with California, some of the reports that just came out from some of the organizations around some of the underlying costs, we've noticed too that some of the overall costs that are associated with such as the reforms on pharmaceutical and other different things, California's performed actually better from a loss cost perspective of some of these things.

We're preferred because we're nimble, because we're creative, because we distribute authority to our teams, they make decisions, they move quickly. 
And we're benefiting from all of those things. And in this environment, I think, for cedents who are sophisticated about their buying, they are absolutely looking to trade up in terms of the quality of their partners, and we benefit from that. And so what we're seeing on programs around the world is we are getting increased signings with our core partners. Because of our broad capabilities, we're also able to trade into deals with core partners that we may not have been on before. And then obviously, as they introduce new programs into the market, we're able to participate there as well. And so we find this to be a very favorable competitive environment that way."

And so that prudence really puts us in a strong position as things start to unwind, and you do see a little bit more activity in terms of litigation and things of that nature, we don't have to react the other way either.

And it's a combination of, obviously, rate, which we're seeing very strongly in the market. It's a combination of terms, conditions, attachment points, limits, our cedents and because we do partner with very high-quality primary underwriters, they are absolutely aggressively addressing changing conditions in the underlying property market. And so I think it actually happens reasonably quickly. But again, and I hate to sound like a broken record on this, this is why we do maintain prudency in our loss picks because some of these things take time to unfold, and we want to make sure that they get proven out.
The other piece that's important when we think about our own profitability in property pro rata is, obviously, loss pick is critical, but we also look at things like ceding commission. And so we've seen improvements in terms there. And that allows us to get to a place where the overall economics are very attractive and which is why we're willing to grow the line."

And so to the extent that cedents believe they're creating margin, they're obviously going to be seeking increased ceding commissions. We've seen a little bit of that activity. It's very modest at this point. And I think for cedents who think about their reinsurers as long-term partners, which really describes our core partners, the ones that we've grown with over the last couple of years, I think they're very balanced about that. And so while there is some upward pressure, and you definitely see people seeking improved ceding commissions in the marketplace, it hasn't had a tremendous impact on our casualty business.

Phil, this is Juan. Let me start out. Please recall in -- I think it was last quarter's earnings call, where we talked about all the levers that we're using to improve the profitability and the margins in our insurance division, but also within reinsurance, right? So it's not just really about mix. It's also about the granular detail of managing the portfolio of making tough decisions on what accounts you stay on, where do you want to grow and being very purposeful about shaping the portfolio and being able to grow it. If I look back at what we have been able to do in the insurance division over the last 18 months, the numbers are pretty clear. We have been able to lower the attritional combined ratio by about 6 points over that period of time since really the end of 2019. 
And a lot of it has been these very presumptive actions on the lines of business that we choose to operate in, not operate in, et cetera. The example, workers' compensation that we talked about earlier to Mike's question, I think, is a perfect example of that, right? So that gives you a sense that while, yes, we have been prudent in our loss picks because we view the environment, as I said earlier, a temporary environment because of COVID with the frequency changes that we saw in that time.

During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line growth across both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, continue to improve underlying profitability for our insurance segment, continued diversification of our reinsurance franchise, demonstrated strong expense discipline, delivered excellent investment income results, opportunistically reduced our cost of capital and returned capital to our shareholders. We continue to execute our plans regardless of the external environment. Before I get into the results, I want to first acknowledge the human cost of the catastrophes in the quarter. For those people whose lives have been affected around the world by the wind, fire, flood and earthquake experienced in the quarter, these are life-changing events, and this is always top of mind for us at Everest. 
As insurers and reinsurers, we are here as these communities work to rebuild, recover and hopefully emerge even stronger. And for Everest, this is when our ability to execute really matters. Turning to the results for the third quarter. The strength and resilience of our fundamentals continues to prove our strategy is working and our execution is on pace. As we shared during the June Investor Day, we measure our success against the 3-year strategic plan with a simple goal: create value and drive meaningful shareholder returns over time. 
This starts by ensuring that our reinsurance and insurance businesses supported by our investment portfolio are doing exactly what we said they would do, drive forward momentum to fuel profitable growth. 
At our core, Everest is a growth company, focused on sustained profitability with a well-diversified earnings stream. Beginning with our Insurance division, which delivered record high quarterly top line growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in gross written premium and the lowest attritional combined ratio to date. We continue to prove our relevance in the market and our ability to execute. There's significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably, and we're capitalizing on it. 
We're well on our way to growing into the world-class specialty global insurer we've set out to be. Reinsurance delivered double-digit growth, and we continue to further diversify our book across lines and geographies around the world, a key part of our disciplined strategy to reduce volatility. This discipline was evident in the previously announced third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $635 million from Hurricane Ida and the July European floods, events totaling over $40 billion in industry insured losses. 
Everest is not immune to the cat losses, but the cumulative, deliberate and purposeful actions we have taken to reduce volatility have changed our company's risk profile. 
We have taken a disciplined approach to diversifying our book and reducing reliance on a single peak cat zone. For example, we have reduced our PMLs for Southeast wind to almost half of what they were in 2017 from 11% to 5.9% of equity. We have scaled back our total property cat XOL premium, which comprises 17% of our total reinsurance premium today versus 26% at the end of 2017. 
Our book is better positioned and less volatile today than it was 2 years ago. We will continue to thoughtfully manage our risk profile to maximize returns. 
Turning to investments. Performance here was excellent. We continue to optimize our portfolio and its earnings power as a key diversifier of our earnings. Prudent capital management is another important part of our strategy. Just after quarter end, we completed an opportunistic $1 billion debt raise at a [ 3.125% ] coupon. This is very efficient long-term capital. In addition, we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the quarter for a total of $200 million year-to-date. 
If the engines of our strategy are core underwriting platforms supported by our investment portfolio, our transformation efforts focused on operational excellence and underwriting discipline are the fuel for those engines. During a quarter when the industry sustained meaningful losses from catastrophes, this discipline made a material difference in our financial outcome. It is about commitment to consistent execution and building a company for the long term. 
Throughout the third quarter, we saw the benefit of this commitment manifest in several ways. We continue to prove we can play offense in a favorable market to pivot and respond to changing market conditions. We're executing on a value proposition that continues to be well received by our customer and broker partners. We have the talent and capabilities to deepen distribution relationships and diversify our presence in key markets around the world. We have established our purpose-driven culture as a differentiator. We also see it in the top industry talent who have joined the Everest and who view the company as a great environment for development and opportunity. 
With that, let's dive into more detail around our results this quarter at the group and segment level. Beginning with our group results. Growth in the third quarter continued to be strong and diversified across both of our businesses. We grew gross written premiums by 25%, a barometer of our market relevance. The increase in premiums was a product of our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions, driving [ exposure ] growth and new business opportunities, the favorable double-digit rate environment and high renewal retention. 
The combined ratio of 112 includes $635 million of pretax net catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida and the European floods during the quarter. The group attritional combined ratio of 87.9 reflects strong underlying profitability in insurance and our continued diversification in reinsurance, coupled with ongoing prudence in loss pick selection. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter resulted in an underwriting loss of $323 million. Net investment income for the quarter was again outstanding, up 25% to $293 million, and the expense ratio also improved this quarter. The meaningful progress this quarter is not a sprint, it's about consistency day by day, quarter by quarter, being thoughtful and strategic about developing the portfolio, prudently managing expenses and pursuing overall operational excellence. These actions all add up. The cumulative effect is evident in our year-to-date results and a few are worth highlighting now. Year-to-date gross written premiums are up 24%. Our businesses continued to drive strong growth and momentum. We generated close to $1 billion in net income year-to-date. This is a testament to the earnings power of the company. 
Net investment income year-to-date has more than doubled from $420 million for the period last year to close to $1 billion today. Our expenses continue to improve and the group attritional combined ratio is also trending better year-to-date. Finally, for the 9 months year-to-date, annualized total shareholder return on equity is over 13%. 
With that, I'd like to turn to the results in our reinsurance business. We had another excellent growth quarter in our Reinsurance division with gross written premiums up 19%. We strengthened the franchise through underwriting actions to create a more diversified, resilient and lower volatility business. The growth was broad and diversified. 
Every geography and targeted line saw continued expansion in the quarter. The combined ratio of [ 1.15 ] includes the impact of third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $555 million from Hurricane Ida and the European floods. Our focused actions to derisk our portfolio are reflected in these results. The share of our book exposed to cat losses has declined. Diversification is key because the severity and frequency of these events are a reality. We see the impact of climate change in our data, and we take a proactive and scientific approach to how we model and underwrite for it. Our dedicated team of experts continuously assess the [ signs ] and integrate its effect on loss cost into our models. This focus will continue to be a key part of our strategy. 
Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 87%, including an attritional loss ratio of 60. Our attritional loss pick reflects our deliberate and targeted shaping of our portfolio to maximize results. This includes a higher mix of pro rata structures and an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. These underwriting actions position Everest to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions achieved by our core cedents in the primary market. 
Combined with continued prudent loss picks, this results in a relatively higher attritional loss ratio but with better long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital. As you know, the primary market has benefited from multiple quarters of strong rate improvement, a reduction in limits and the strengthening of terms and conditions. Our strategy of focusing growth on core trading partners means we're benefiting from these effects alongside some of the industry's best underwriters, and we expect strong portfolio economics to emerge. 
Risk-adjusted return expectations are improving in every line in every geography. At the same time, we remain vigilant regarding market trends, including climate change, supply constraints and social and material inflation. As a result, we continue to hold prudent loss picks. Finally, Mt. Logan continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have brought in John Modin as its new leader. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. 
Now for our Insurance division. Performance continued to be strong with exceptional growth in expanding underlying margins. In the third quarter, we wrote over $1 billion in gross written premium for the second quarter in a row and achieved the highest quarterly growth rate to date at 43%. The growth in Insurance was fueled by a few factors: Number one, we continue to seize opportunities from increasingly favorable economic conditions. Second, we continue to grow through new business and demonstrate our relevance to customers and brokers. Third, we're benefiting from strong retention rates. This coupled with continued favorable, double-digit rate increases is creating the kind of opportunity Everest was built for and that we're poised to capitalize on. 
We maintain a strong focus on portfolio management as an important part of our strategy and driver of long-term profitability. We continue to proactively position the company to play offense and react nimbly to market conditions by driving our business mix stores product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins. 
Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 12% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 8%, including workers' compensation, which now represents 12% of our overall portfolio with monoline comp down to only 7%. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 17%; and financial lines, up 14%. I've said it before, those who execute best in this business win and the quality of growth in Insurance and our focused discipline comes down to simply excellent execution. 
During the third quarter, we expanded attritional underwriting margins with improvements in loss and expense ratios. This includes a 2 percentage point improvement in our attritional loss ratio of 62.9% and an improvement to 14 in the operating expense ratio. This resulted in the division's lowest attritional combined ratio to date at 90.3, an almost 4-point improvement over the same period last year. 
The underwriting loss of $17.2 million in the quarter was a result of the impact of pretax net catastrophe losses, including $80 million for Hurricane Ida. However, the year-to-date underwriting profitability shows the indicative strength of our portfolio and ability to execute. 
We have a long runway in front of us, and we're investing in the talent, the systems and our worldwide capabilities to make us better, more efficient and more relevant in the market. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Reflecting on the progress we made against our long-term objectives, it is evident we're working with the right formula for success. 
Everest management team has the level of focus, deep expertise, an entrepreneurial approach to take us on our path forward and bring this even further. I am proud of the work we're doing, building on a strong inclusive culture that is constantly delivering for our clients and for our partners, pushing the envelope in digital innovation and our commitments as good corporate citizens. The opportunities are there, and Everest is well positioned to seize them. 
Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark?"
340813,1682221221,2415446,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter",1394,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter results. For the third quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.5 billion, representing 25.3% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, Reinsurance grew 19.2% to $2.5 billion and Insurance once again reported gross written premium of $1 billion in the quarter, representing 43.2% year-over-year growth. 
Year-to-date, the group's gross written premium was $9.6 billion, up 24.4% compared with the $7.7 billion figure from the first 9 months of 2020. Turning to net income. Net income results for the quarter were impacted by the global cat events seen worldwide, particularly Hurricane Ida in the U.S. and European flooding in Germany and Belgium. As a result, for the third quarter, Everest reported a net loss of $73 million and a net operating loss of $53 million, equal to negative $1.88 and negative $1.34 per share, respectively. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, Everest reported net income of $948 million and operating income of $795 million, equal to $23.72 and $19.87 per common share, respectively. Everest reported $635 million in net catastrophe losses during the quarter, as detailed in our October 14 earnings press release. The manageable losses from these events are strong evidence of the material derisking of the portfolio over the past few years, that Jon described and as evidenced by our reduced PMLs. 
Importantly, these results were well within Everest's expectations from events of this magnitude and within our risk appetite. We also note that there is no prior period development in the cat losses this quarter. All are current accident quarter events. Beyond data and the European floods, there were a number of smaller events, which did not breach the Everest cat event threshold of $10 million per event. Our practice for reserving for these smaller events is to include them in our attritional loss ratio estimates. And as such, these events did not materially impact our Q3 attritional loss ratio selections. I also note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. 
Third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives for the group. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the third quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 59.3% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.6% compared with 60.2% a year ago, reflecting our overall mix of business shift to longer tail casualty lines. 
The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.9% for the third quarter compared to 85.8% for the third quarter of 2020. And year-to-date, the attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% compared with 88% a year ago as commission and expense ratio improvements offset the attritional loss ratio movements. 
For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 62.9% compared with 64.8% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved 3.9 points during Q3 to 90.3% as compared to 94.2% over the same period a year ago, given the favorable attritional loss ratio improvement and the reduced expense ratio. Our U.S. Insurance business, which makes up the majority of the book continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. Turning to Reinsurance. Attritional losses in the Reinsurance segment were largely driven by changes to the mix of business, notably proportionately more casualty premium plus 4.8% year-over-year. As a result, the third quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 60.2% compared with 57.5% a year ago, and the attritional combined ratio for Reinsurance was 87.1% compared with 83% for the third quarter of 2020. 
The group's commission ratio of 21.2% for the third quarter was up 1 percentage point from 20.2% reported in Q3 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix with more pro rata property and casualty business, which has a higher commission ratio versus excess of loss. The group expense ratio was exceptional at 5.3% for the quarter and down a full point as compared with 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management and the benefits of increased scale and efficiency from our operating model. 
For the third quarter, investment income once again produced an exceptional result of $293 million as compared to $234 million for Q3 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $170 million of income during the third quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments, driven by the continued economic and financial markets recovery. As a reminder, Everest reports limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. So the current quarter results are based on the valuations as of June 30. Invested assets at the end of the third quarter totaled [ $27.8 billion ] compared with $27.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 78% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.3 years. 
The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective taxes on net income and operating income for the third quarter of 2021 were negative 16.2% and negative 21.4%, respectively. The variance from our estimated tax rate of 11% for the year was largely due to the geographic distribution of income impacted this quarter by the catastrophe losses, which were primarily underwritten on our U.S. domiciled entities. For the first 9 months of 2021, Everest generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow compared to $2.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. And we also note that operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at approximately $1.2 billion. The Everest balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was just under $10 billion at the end of the third quarter compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. 
Our attractiveness as a counterparty was endorsed by the markets as evidenced by the debt raise in early October. Everest issued $1 billion of 31-year senior notes at a very attractive coupon of [ 3.125% ] lowering our cost of capital over the long term. with this additional capital, Everest's pro forma financial leverage at the end of Q3 is just above 20%, in line with our long-term target of 15% to 20%, and we will manage our leverage within this range as we continue to optimize our capital structure through the course of the strategic plan. 
And as with the offering from last year, we will deploy the proceeds into the business given the organic growth opportunities highlighted in our strategic plan and the current favorable underwriting environment. Everest repurchased 625,000 shares in the quarter for a total of $160 million. And year-to-date, the numbers are 791,000 shares and $200 million. Quarter end book value per share was $253.40 compared with [ $260.32 ] at the end of the second quarter, resulting from $100 million in the change in unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio, driven by changes in interest rates plus the quarterly net income result. 
And I want to close with an update on our progress towards the Everest total return or TSR target as detailed during our Investor Day. Through the third quarter of 2021, the TSR stands at 13.2% annualized on track to meet the 3-year TSR target of at least 13%. The fundamentals of our long-term value creation plan remains strong based on the diversified set of earnings streams.  Reinsurance, Insurance and investments, along with an efficient capital structure, we affirm our strategic plan assumptions and TSR target over the 3-year time frame as detailed in our June Investor Day. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to John."

The way we look at our reserving And again, I think I've been pretty consistent about this since I started as a CEO here almost 2 years ago is we're very disciplined. 
As I mentioned in my remarks, we are also cognizant of the external environment whether it's social inflation, climate change, CPI-type inflation and everything that's out there right now. So we do prefer to let things season over time before we take action and bring that down. However, you also saw in the insurance numbers this quarter, the improvement that we made in the loss ratio. And again, this is consecutive to prior quarters as well. And I would point the fact to, again, statements I've made in the past that it's not only about rate, it's about all the management actions day-to-day in the portfolio. How we look at individual books of business, how we shape that portfolio, how we manage that. How we focus our attention, our execution on lines of business that we believe have a higher potential for long-term margins. So all of that is built into that.

Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter -- loss ratio this quarter is really the result of deliberate actions that we're taking, right?  And those are deliberate actions to accomplish really 3 things: Number 1 is to fully benefit from the strong market that we're seeing. We're seeing rates in long tail lines to be up, terms and conditions to have been improved, limits to have been shortened. 
And so as a result of that, we're growing in our pro rata structures [indiscernible] casualty alongside some of the best underwriters in the primary market. You see it in the supplement. Our casualty pro rata business was up 63% for the quarter. So that's indicative of how we're playing off and taking advantage of these market conditions there. 
The second thing for us that we're trying to accomplish is really this is part of our deliberate strategy to reduce volatility and diversify our book opportunistically in the lines of business that we believe can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. That's the other part that you're seeing there right now. It's us purposely moving our book of business in a direction that we believe will give us long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital that are quite attractive. 
And the third part of it, and this is related to the answer that I just gave to Elyse, again, as I've said from the beginning, we are a disciplined underwriting company, and we do maintain prudent loss picks in light of the external environment. So what you are seeing is that particularly the long tail lines will carry essentially higher loss picks than the short tail lines. And as we move that business over, this is the end result that you will see but with an outcome that we expect to return much better margins in the future while reducing the volatility of the company. 
The bottom line is we feel very good about the portfolio that we're creating right now and the embedded margin that we're creating. And we also feel very good about this being able to achieve the targets that we laid out on Investor Day and that Mark just affirmed."

And when you unpack their results in terms of what they're seeing from a rate change perspective, their ability to reduce limit profiles to improve terms and conditions. These are not subtle changes. These will have a dramatic impact, obviously, on the quality of the book that we have today, and we're very excited about that. And our expectation is that those conditions will persist. And so we want to continue to partner with those core [ cedents ] as they move through this market. 
But the last thing I would add, obviously, is we remain very flexible. And where we see good risk-adjusted returns, we're absolutely willing to shift our mix quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, and we will retain that flexibility as we move forward."

And so it's about the pursuit of good bottom line performance, about good, consistent results, about achieving our long-term strategic ambitions and about managing the volatility of the group. Those are really the decision factors that are driving the growth that we're seeing in casualty."

So obviously, our cat budget and our cat planning exercise within the operating plan is modeled out based on expected losses. Clearly, there's been substantial volatility over several of the years, not all of them. Last year was a bit more modest, actually below plan. The 7% is how it works out mechanically between Reinsurance and Insurance. Having said that, we have taken our cat portfolio and reduced its risk profile over the years since -- essentially since Harvey, Irma, Maria back in 2017. And so that derisking that we've taken has been quite conscious. 
And alternatively, the group, and I think you saw this highlighted during the Investor Day is really expanding in other non-cat lines of business.

Let me address that, Brian, and then I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it. Look, I think it's important to recognize what inflation means to the industry versus what we see in the CPI index and the headline news that's out there. I think it's undeniable that we are in a period of inflationary pressure from a purely CPI perspective. You see it in our goods. You see the upsurge in demand, the restriction in supply that's going on up there. And you definitely see a part of that. And it's manifested in used car values and chips and all of these things that are out there basically. 
From our perspective, we monitor from the asset and the liability side. On the liability side of our balance sheet, we're specifically focused on wage inflation, and also on health care inflation, the cost of medical care, basically. Those are critical things that we watch very carefully. Now your question on how that translates into how we think about loss picks, et cetera, is excellent because that is part of the analysis that we do on a quarterly basis. 
When we're looking at our loss picks and frankly, when we're doing our bridging for future year plans and when we're doing our reserve studies, et cetera, we try to build in those inflationary pressures into our numbers. And it's one of the reasons why we keep pushing for pricing and why we believe that this pricing environment will continue for at least another year, if not longer, for the longer-tail classes of businesses. The other thing that's important to recognize is that also on the liability side, there are some mitigants in the book, right? 
So if you think about exposure rated lines like general liability, workers' compensation, et cetera, those will rise also with the impact of inflation. And so there's some hedges that are built into that. But the primary hedge for us is how we look at our loss picks and how we do the analysis on a quarterly basis. When we look at the asset side of the balance sheet that's also how we position our portfolio to make sure that we're as fire proofed as possible and why we maintain the liquidity that. But let me ask Mark to add some commentary on the asset side, and then I'll invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more on the liability side."

Look, on the asset side, this is something we think about because it's unclear how permanent or transitory, the inflationary pressure that we're seeing is going to be going forward. And so we've got our portfolio -- the asset portfolio positioned such that we think it can react reasonably well versus a high inflation environment. And so there's a high degree of liquidity as well that augments the kind of cash demands that you would have in a high-inflation scenario. We benefit from shorter-term asset duration and a relatively short duration on the liability portfolio plus a significant amount of assets in exposed to equities or floating rate debt, which should be somewhat immunized in a high-inflation environment. 
The other piece that I'll add maybe before Jim steps in, is we have stressed the liability portfolio for different inflation scenarios and to see how it would perform in our ability to absorb it. And so that's something we do in addition to the reserving side, the assumptions, et cetera, is to see how it can perform in different types of environments."

I'll just address the second part of your question related to any bounce back that we may be seeing in our data related to the reopening of courts and frankly, the reopening and growth in the economy. And I think there is a degree of bounce back occurring. We certainly see it in areas like liability frequencies. We see it in medical utilization. It's not a tremendous effect, but it's also, I think, feeds into the rationale for being very consistent in how we set loss picks and not over responding to some of the good news that has come through in our data. And you waited for that to mature so that some of these transitory items like a bounce back in activity have time to play themselves out, and that's very consistent with our approach around loss selection."

I think we've done a very nice job growing it in the U.S. specifically over time. And we see significant overseas opportunity, right? The reality is that the market is quite big, and it's also a diversifying opportunity. One of the things that you learn over time is that emerging markets and developed markets move at different rhythms. 
And so when developed economies are down, emerging economies are up, and it's a good diversifying hedge from that perspective, in addition to the insurance market opportunity that's out there. Right now, we have a company out of Ireland that allows us to do business in the Continental Europe. We have our Lloyd's syndicate. And so we're able to utilize it as a platform for expansion in Europe and in the U.K. 
When you start thinking about expansion into Latin America and Asia, you are thinking more of a greenfield-type opportunity at that point in time. And our plans are very much in motion right now to be able to grow that business organically. But it also goes back to the question that I was asked earlier in the call as to how does M&A potentially fit into all of this? And our strategy is organic, as I said, but we're also mindful of any opportunities that may help to accelerate our progress as we move forward."

So at the beginning of the quarter and also in September. And if I could just add, Josh, sorry, it's Mark speaking. If I could just add a couple of points. we made it pretty clear during the Investor Day that we felt we could get a more efficient capital structure, and part of that is increasing the debt leverage of the company into a 15% to 20% range. 
And when you look at the kind of print that we got, the [ 3.125% ] coupon, that's very low long-term capital cost. So for us, the combination of issuing the debt and using that to fund future growth expansion is really a function of providing a lower cost of capital for that organic growth in line with, I think, what is a more conventional capital structure with something closer to 20% debt leverage. I think the share buybacks, that's really look, a function of our confidence in our business. I wouldn't read too much else into it. The volatility that we had from the cats is something that we expect in this business. It was very much in our risk appetite. It never dissuaded us from any kind of capital management actions. And so we we move forward here with a lot of confidence, and that was one of the points I was trying to make towards the end of my monologue regarding the affirmation of our plan assumptions, the target and the path that we're on. 
We feel like there's an excellent opportunity in front of us. We're built for it. We're executing. There's a lot of momentum."

Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation.

During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line growth across both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, continued to improve underlying profitability for our insurance segment, continued diversification of our reinsurance franchise, demonstrated strong expense discipline, delivered excellent investment income results, opportunistically reduced our cost of capital and returned capital to our shareholders. We continued to execute our plans regardless of the external environment. Before I get into the results, I want to first acknowledge the human cost of the catastrophes in the quarter. For those people whose lives have been affected around the world by the wind, fire, flood and earthquake experienced in the quarter, these are life-changing events, and this is always top of mind for us at Everest.  
As insurers and reinsurers, we are here as these communities work to rebuild, recover and hopefully emerge even stronger. And for Everest, this is when our ability to execute really matters. Turning to the results for the third quarter. The strength and resilience of our fundamentals continues to prove our strategy is working and our execution is on pace. As we shared during the June Investor Day, we measure our success against the 3-year strategic plan with a simple goal: create value and drive meaningful shareholder returns over time.  
This starts by ensuring that our reinsurance and insurance businesses supported by our investment portfolio are doing exactly what we said they would do, drive forward momentum to fuel profitable growth.  
At our core, Everest is a growth company, focused on sustained profitability with a well-diversified earnings stream. Beginning with our Insurance division, which delivered record high quarterly top line growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in gross written premium and the lowest attritional combined ratio to date. We continue to prove our relevance in the market and our ability to execute. There's significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably, and we're capitalizing on it.  
We're well on our way to growing into the world-class specialty global insurer we've set out to be. Reinsurance delivered double-digit growth, and we continued to further diversify our book across lines and geographies around the world, a key part of our disciplined strategy to reduce volatility. This discipline was evident in the previously announced third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $635 million from Hurricane Ida and the July European floods, events totaling over $40 billion in industry insured losses.  
Everest does not immune to the cat losses, but the cumulative, deliberate and purposeful actions we have taken to reduce volatility have changed our company's risk profile.  
We have taken a disciplined approach to diversifying our book and reducing reliance on a single peak cat zone. For example, we have reduced our PMLs for Southeast wind to almost half of what they were in 2017 from 11% to 5.9% of equity. We have scaled back our total property cat XOL premium, which comprises 17% of our total reinsurance premium today versus 26% at the end of 2017.  
Our book is better positioned and less volatile today than it was 2 years ago. We will continue to thoughtfully manage our risk profile to maximize returns.  
Turning to investments. Performance here was excellent. We continued to optimize our portfolio and its earnings power as a key diversifier of our earnings. Prudent capital management is another important part of our strategy. Just after quarter end, we completed an opportunistic $1 billion debt raise at a 3.125 coupon. This is very efficient long-term capital. In addition, we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the quarter for a total of $200 million year-to-date.  
If the engines of our strategy, our core underwriting platforms supported by our investment portfolio, our transformation efforts focused on operational excellence and underwriting discipline are the fuel for those engines. During a quarter when the industry sustained meaningful losses from catastrophes, this discipline made a material difference in our financial outcome. It is about commitment to consistent execution and building a company for the long term.  
Throughout the third quarter, we saw the benefit of this commitment manifest in several ways. We continue to prove we can play offense in a favorable market to pivot and respond to changing market conditions. We're executing on a value proposition that continues to be well received by our customer and broker partners. We have the talent and capabilities to deepen distribution relationships and diversify our presence in key markets around the world. We have established our purpose-driven culture as a differentiator. We also see it in the top industry talent who have joined the Everest and who viewed the company as a great environment for development and opportunity.  
With that, let's dive into more detail around our results this quarter at the group and segment level. Beginning with our group results. Growth in the third quarter continued to be strong and diversified across both of our businesses. We grew gross written premiums by 25%, a barometer of our market relevance. The increase in premiums was a product of our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions, driving exposure growth and new business opportunities, the favorable double-digit rate environment and high renewal retention.  
The combined ratio of 112 includes $635 million of pretax net catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida and the European floods during the quarter. The group attritional combined ratio of 87.9 reflects strong underlying profitability in insurance and our continued diversification in reinsurance, coupled with ongoing prudence in loss pick selection. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter resulted in an underwriting loss of $323 million. Net investment income for the quarter was again outstanding, up 25% to $293 million, and the expense ratio also improved this quarter. 
The meaningful progress this quarter is not a sprint, it's about consistency day by day, quarter by quarter, being thoughtful and strategic about developing the portfolio, prudently managing expenses and pursuing overall operational excellence. These actions all add up. The cumulative effect is evident in our year-to-date results and a few are worth highlighting now. Year-to-date gross written premiums are up 24%. Our businesses continued to drive strong growth and momentum. We generated close to $1 billion in net income year-to-date. This is a testament to the earnings power of the company.  
Net investment income year-to-date has more than doubled from $420 million for the period last year to close to $1 billion today. Our expenses continued to improve and the group attritional combined ratio is also trending better year-to-date. Finally, for the 9 months year-to-date, annualized total shareholder return on equity is over 13%.  
With that, I'd like to turn to the results in our reinsurance business. We had another excellent growth quarter in our Reinsurance division with gross written premiums up 19%. We strengthened the franchise through underwriting actions to create a more diversified, resilient and lower volatility business. The growth was broad and diversified.  
Every geography and targeted line saw continued expansion in the quarter. The combined ratio of 115 includes the impact of third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $555 million from Hurricane Ida and the European floods. Our focused actions to derisk our portfolio are reflected in these results. The share of our book exposed to cat losses has declined. Diversification is key because the severity and frequency of these events are a reality. We see the impact of climate change in our data, and we take a proactive and scientific approach to how we model and underwrite for it. Our dedicated team of experts continuously assess the signs and integrate its effect on loss cost into our models. This focus will continue to be a key part of our strategy.  
Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 87%, including an attritional loss ratio of 60. Our attritional loss pick reflects our deliberate and targeted shaping of our portfolio to maximize results. This includes a higher mix of pro rata structures and an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. These underwriting actions positioned Everest to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions achieved by our core cedents in the primary market.  
Combined with continued prudent loss picks, this results in a relatively higher attritional loss ratio but with better long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital. As you know, the primary market has benefited from multiple quarters of strong rate improvement, a reduction in limits and the strengthening of terms and conditions. Our strategy of focusing growth on core trading partners means we're benefiting from these effects alongside some of the industry's best underwriters, and we expect strong portfolio economics to emerge.  
Risk-adjusted return expectations are improving in every line, in every geography. At the same time, we remain vigilant regarding market trends, including climate change, supply constraints and social and material inflation. As a result, we continue to hold prudent loss picks. Finally, Mt. Logan continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have brought in John Modin as its new leader. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.  
Now for our Insurance division. Performance continued to be strong with exceptional growth in expanding underlying margins. In the third quarter, we wrote over $1 billion in gross written premium for the second quarter in a row and achieved the highest quarterly growth rate to date at 43%. The growth in Insurance was fueled by a few factors: Number one, we continue to seize opportunities from increasingly favorable economic conditions. Second, we continue to grow through new business and demonstrate our relevance to customers and brokers. Third, we're benefiting from strong retention rates. This coupled with continued favorable, double-digit rate increases is creating the kind of opportunity Everest was built for and that we're poised to capitalize on.  
We maintain a strong focus on portfolio management as an important part of our strategy and driver of long-term profitability. We continue to proactively position the company to play offense and react nimbly to market conditions by driving our business mix stores product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins.  
Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 12% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 8%, including workers' compensation, which now represents 12% of our overall portfolio with monoline comp down to only 7%. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 17%; and financial lines, up 14%. I've said it before, those who execute best in this business win and the quality of growth in Insurance and our focused discipline comes down to simply excellent execution.  
During the third quarter, we expanded attritional underwriting margins with improvements in loss and expense ratios. This includes a 2 percentage point improvement in our attritional loss ratio of 62.9% and an improvement to 14 in the operating expense ratio. This resulted in the division's lowest attritional combined ratio to date at 90.3, an almost 4-point improvement over the same period last year.  
The underwriting loss of $17.2 million in the quarter was a result of the impact of pretax net catastrophe losses, including $80 million for Hurricane Ida. However, the year-to-date underwriting profitability shows the indicative strength of our portfolio and ability to execute. 
We have a long runway in front of us, and we're investing in the talent, the systems and our worldwide capabilities to make us better, more efficient and more relevant in the market. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Reflecting on the progress we made against our long-term objectives, it is evident we're working with the right formula for success.  
Everest management team has the level of focus, deep expertise, an entrepreneurial approach to take us on our path forward and bring this even further. I am proud of the work we're doing, building on a strong inclusive culture that is constantly delivering for our clients and for our partners, pushing the envelope in digital innovation and our commitments as good corporate citizens. The opportunities are there, and Everest is well positioned to seize them.  
Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark?"
340813,1682221221,2415618,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter",1388,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter results. For the third quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.5 billion, representing 25.3% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, Reinsurance grew 19.2% to $2.5 billion and Insurance once again reported gross written premium of $1 billion in the quarter, representing 43.2% year-over-year growth. 
Year-to-date, the group's gross written premium was $9.6 billion, up 24.4% compared with the $7.7 billion figure from the first 9 months of 2020. Turning to net income. Net income results for the quarter were impacted by the global cat events seen worldwide, particularly Hurricane Ida in the U.S. and European flooding in Germany and Belgium. As a result, for the third quarter, Everest reported a net loss of $73 million and a net operating loss of $53 million, equal to negative $1.88 and negative $1.34 per share, respectively. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, Everest reported net income of $948 million and operating income of $795 million, equal to $23.72 and $19.87 per common share, respectively. Everest reported $635 million in net catastrophe losses during the quarter, as detailed in our October 14 earnings press release. The manageable losses from these events are strong evidence of the material derisking of the portfolio over the past few years, that Jon described and as evidenced by our reduced PMLs. 
Importantly, these results were well within Everest's expectations from events of this magnitude and within our risk appetite. We also note that there is no prior period development in the cat losses this quarter. All are current accident quarter events. Beyond Ida and the European floods, there were a number of smaller events, which did not breach the Everest cat event threshold of $10 million per event. Our practice for reserving for these smaller events is to include them in our attritional loss ratio estimates. And as such, these events did not materially impact our Q3 attritional loss ratio selections. I also note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. 
Third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives for the group. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the third quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 59.3% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.6% compared with 60.2% a year ago, reflecting our overall mix of business shift to longer tail casualty lines. 
The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.9% for the third quarter compared to 85.8% for the third quarter of 2020. And year-to-date, the attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% compared with 88% a year ago as commission and expense ratio improvements offset the attritional loss ratio movement. 
For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 62.9% compared with 64.8% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved 3.9 points during Q3 to 90.3% as compared to 94.2% over the same period a year ago, given the favorable attritional loss ratio improvement and the reduced expense ratio. Our U.S. Insurance business, which makes up the majority of the book continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. Turning to Reinsurance. Attritional losses in the Reinsurance segment were largely driven by changes to the mix of business, notably proportionately more casualty premium plus 4.8% year-over-year. As a result, the third quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 60.2% compared with 57.5% a year ago, and the attritional combined ratio for Reinsurance was 87.1% compared with 83% for the third quarter of 2020. 
The group's commission ratio of 21.2% for the third quarter was up 1 percentage point from 20.2% reported in Q3 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix with more pro rata property and casualty business, which has a higher commission ratio versus excess of loss. The group expense ratio was exceptional at 5.3% for the quarter and down a full point as compared with 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management and the benefits of increased scale and efficiency from our operating model. 
For the third quarter, investment income once again produced an exceptional result of $293 million as compared to $234 million for Q3 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $170 million of income during the third quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments, driven by the continued economic and financial markets recovery. As a reminder, Everest reports limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. So the current quarter results are based on the valuations as of June 30. Invested assets at the end of the third quarter totaled $27.8 billion compared with $27.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 78% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.3 years. 
The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective taxes on net income and operating income for the third quarter of 2021 were negative 16.2% and negative 21.4%, respectively. The variance from our estimated tax rate of 11% for the year was largely due to the geographic distribution of income impacted this quarter by the catastrophe losses, which were primarily underwritten on our U.S. domiciled entities. For the first 9 months of 2021, Everest generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow compared to $2.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. And we also note that operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at approximately $1.2 billion. The Everest balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was just under $10 billion at the end of the third quarter compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. 
Our attractiveness as a counterparty was endorsed by the markets as evidenced by the debt raise in early October. Everest issued $1 billion of 31-year senior notes at a very attractive coupon of 3.125 lowering our cost of capital over the long term. With this additional capital, Everest's pro forma financial leverage at the end of Q3 is just above 20%, in line with our long-term target of 15% to 20%, and we will manage our leverage within this range as we continue to optimize our capital structure through the course of the strategic plan. 
And as with the offering from last year, we will deploy the proceeds into the business given the organic growth opportunities highlighted in our strategic plan and the current favorable underwriting environment. Everest repurchased 625,000 shares in the quarter for a total of $160 million. And year-to-date, the numbers are 791,000 shares and $200 million. Quarter end book value per share was $253.40 compared with $260.32 at the end of the second quarter, resulting from $100 million in the change in unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio, driven by changes in interest rates plus the quarterly net income result. 
And I want to close with an update on our progress towards the Everest total return or TSR target as detailed during our Investor Day. Through the third quarter of 2021, the TSR stands at 13.2% annualized on track to meet the 3-year TSR target of at least 13%. The fundamentals of our long-term value creation plan remains strong based on the diversified set of earnings streams.  Reinsurance, Insurance and investments, along with an efficient capital structure, we affirm our strategic plan assumptions and TSR target over the 3-year time frame as detailed in our June Investor Day. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Juan."

As I mentioned in my remarks, we are also cognizant of the external environment whether it's social inflation, climate change, CPI-type inflation and everything that's out there right now. So we do prefer to let things seasoned over time before we take action and bring that down. However, you also saw in the insurance numbers this quarter, the improvement that we made in the loss ratio. And again, this is consecutive to prior quarters as well. And I would point the fact to, again, statements I've made in the past that it's not only about rate, it's about all the management actions day-to-day in the portfolio. How we look at individual books of business, how we shape that portfolio, how we manage that. How we focus our attention, our execution on lines of business that we believe have a higher potential for long-term margins. So all of that is built into that.

Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter -- loss ratio this quarter is really the result of deliberate actions that we're taking, right?  And those are deliberate actions to accomplish really 3 things: Number one is to fully benefit from the strong market that we're seeing. We're seeing rates in long tail lines to be up, terms and conditions to have been improved, limits to have been shortened. 
And so as a result of that, we're growing in our pro rata structures in casualty alongside some of the best underwriters in the primary market. You see it in the supplement. Our casualty pro rata business was up 63% for the quarter. So that's indicative of how we're playing off and taking advantage of these market conditions there. 
The second thing for us that we're trying to accomplish is really this is part of our deliberate strategy to reduce volatility and diversify our book opportunistically in the lines of business that we believe can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. That's the other part that you're seeing there right now. It's us purposely moving our book of business in a direction that we believe will give us long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital that are quite attractive. 
And the third part of it, and this is related to the answer that I just gave to Elyse, again, as I've said from the beginning, we are a disciplined underwriting company, and we do maintain prudent loss picks in light of the external environment. So what you are seeing is that particularly the long tail lines will carry essentially higher loss picks than the short tail lines. And as we move that business over, this is the end result that you will see but with an outcome that we expect to return much better margins in the future while reducing the volatility of the company. 
The bottom line is we feel very good about the portfolio that we're creating right now and the embedded margin that we're creating. And we also feel very good about this being able to achieve the targets that we laid out on Investor Day and that Mark just affirmed."

The only thing I would add to what Juan had said and really only to add some additional color is, we obviously are very close to our core cedents who are driving the really strong growth that we've had in areas like casualty pro rata. And when you unpack their results in terms of what they're seeing from a rate change perspective, their ability to reduce limit profiles to improve terms and conditions. These are not subtle changes. These will have a dramatic impact, obviously, on the quality of the book that we have today, and we're very excited about that. And our expectation is that those conditions will persist. And so we want to continue to partner with those core cedents as they move through this market. 
But the last thing I would add, obviously, is we remain very flexible. And where we see good risk-adjusted returns, we're absolutely willing to shift our mix quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, and we will retain that flexibility as we move forward."

So obviously, our cat budget and our cat planning exercise within the operating plan is modeled out based on expected losses. Clearly, there's been substantial volatility over several of the years, not all of them. Last year was a bit more modest, actually below plan. The 7% is how it works out mechanically between Reinsurance and Insurance. Having said that, we have taken our cat portfolio and reduced its risk profile over the years since -- essentially since Harvey, Irma, Maria back in 2017. And so that derisking that we've taken has been quite conscious. 
And alternatively, the group, and I think you saw this highlighted during the Investor Day is really expanding in other non-cat lines of business.

But we're also mindful that the external market conditions have changed over time. And they have changed for a number of reasons, right? You clearly have the impact of climate changes as we've discussed that has manifested. We certainly see the impact of the ILS market that basically, I think, has muted the size of the rate increases that you see post events like Ida into that market. 
And so while we see this an attractive line of business, we also see better returns in other lines of business going forward. And it's part and parcel of the reason why we have been on this derisking journey that we have continued to talk about to essentially change the profile of our company. 
So all of that is in our minds. We are students of the environment. We are students of the science. We're also very disciplined in how we look at our portfolio and how we allocate capital between lines of business. And this brings us full circle back to the question to the lease and Mike Zaremski asked earlier in the call, right?

Let me address that, Brian, and then I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it.

Let me address that, Brian, and then I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it. Look, I think it's important to recognize what inflation means to the industry versus what we see in the CPI index and the headline news that's out there. I think it's undeniable that we are in a period of inflationary pressure from a purely CPI perspective. You see it in our goods. You see the upsurge in demand, the restriction in supply that's going on up there. And you definitely see a part of that. And it's manifested in used car values and chips and all of these things that are out there basically. 
From our perspective, we monitor from the asset and the liability side. On the liability side of our balance sheet, we're specifically focused on wage inflation, and also on health care inflation, the cost of medical care, basically. Those are critical things that we watch very carefully. Now your question on how that translates into how we think about loss picks, et cetera, is excellent because that is part of the analysis that we do on a quarterly basis. 
When we're looking at our loss picks and frankly, when we're doing our bridging for future year plans and when we're doing our reserve studies, et cetera, we try to build in those inflationary pressures into our numbers. And it's one of the reasons why we keep pushing for pricing and why we believe that this pricing environment will continue for at least another year, if not longer, for the longer-tail classes of businesses. The other thing that's important to recognize is that also on the liability side, there are some mitigants in the book, right? 
So if you think about exposure rated lines like general liability, workers' compensation, et cetera, those will rise also with the impact of inflation. And so there's some hedges that are built into that. But the primary hedge for us is how we look at our loss picks and how we do the analysis on a quarterly basis. When we look at the asset side of the balance sheet that's also how we position our portfolio to make sure that we're as fire proofed as possible and why we maintain the liquidity that. But let me ask Mark to add some commentary on the asset side, and then I'll invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more on the liability side."

Look, on the asset side, this is something we think about because it's unclear how permanent or transitory, the inflationary pressure that we're seeing is going to be going forward. And so we've got our portfolio -- the asset portfolio positioned such that we think it can react reasonably well versus a high inflation environment. And so there's a high degree of liquidity as well that augments the kind of cash demands that you would have in a high-inflation scenario. We benefit from shorter-term asset duration and a relatively short duration on the liability portfolio plus a significant amount of assets in exposed to equities or floating rate debt, which should be somewhat immunized in a high-inflation environment. 
The other piece that I'll add maybe before Jim steps in, is we have stressed the liability portfolio for different inflation scenarios and to see how it would perform in our ability to absorb it. And so that's something we do in addition to the reserving side, the assumptions, et cetera, is to see how it can perform in different types of environments."

I'll just address the second part of your question related to any bounce back that we may be seeing in our data related to the reopening of courts and frankly, the reopening and growth in the economy. And I think there is a degree of bounce back occurring. We certainly see it in areas like liability frequencies. We see it in medical utilization. It's not a tremendous effect, but it's also, I think, feeds into the rationale for being very consistent in how we set loss picks and not over responding to some of the good news that has come through in our data. And you waited for that to mature so that some of these transitory items like a bounce back in activity have time to play themselves out, and that's very consistent with our approach around loss selection."

I think we've done a very nice job growing it in the U.S. specifically over time. And we see significant overseas opportunity, right? The reality is that the market is quite big, and it's also a diversifying opportunity. One of the things that you learn over time is that emerging markets and developed markets move at different rhythms. 
And so when developed economies are down, emerging economies are up, and it's a good diversifying hedge from that perspective, in addition to the insurance market opportunity that's out there. Right now, we have a company out of Ireland that allows us to do business in the Continental Europe. We have our Lloyd's syndicate. And so we're able to utilize it as a platform for expansion in Europe and in the U.K. 
When you start thinking about expansion into Latin America and Asia, you are thinking more of a greenfield-type opportunity at that point in time. And our plans are very much in motion right now to be able to grow that business organically. But it also goes back to the question that I was asked earlier in the call as to how does M&A potentially fit into all of this?

But within workers' compensation, our focus has really been more on the loss ratable risk management-type business where we can actually get better pricing than the monoline. And that's one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks, I emphasized the fact that while comp overall is now down to only 12% of the portfolio, monoline is down to only 7% of the portfolio, right? So it's important to understand that nuance within comp at the same time."

So at the beginning of the quarter and also in September. And if I could just add, Josh, sorry, it's Mark speaking. If I could just add a couple of points, we made it pretty clear during the Investor Day that we felt we could get a more efficient capital structure, and part of that is increasing the debt leverage of the company into a 15% to 20% range. 
And when you look at the kind of print that we got, the 3.125 coupon, that's very low long-term capital cost. So for us, the combination of issuing the debt and using that to fund future growth expansion is really a function of providing a lower cost of capital for that organic growth in line with, I think, what is a more conventional capital structure with something closer to 20% debt leverage.
I think the share buybacks, that's really look, a function of our confidence in our business. I wouldn't read too much else into it. The volatility that we had from the cats is something that we expect in this business. It was very much in our risk appetite. It never dissuaded us from any kind of capital management actions. And so we move forward here with a lot of confidence, and that was one of the points I was trying to make towards the end of my monologue regarding the affirmation of our plan, assumptions, the target and the path that we're on.

Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line",2052,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, Everest continued to make progress towards the strategic plan objectives detailed in the June Investor Day presentation. We achieved outstanding top line growth across both our insurance and reinsurance businesses, continued to improve underlying profitability for our insurance segment, continued diversification of our reinsurance franchise, demonstrated strong expense discipline, delivered excellent investment income results, opportunistically reduced our cost of capital and returned capital to our shareholders. We continued to execute our plans regardless of the external environment. Before I get into the results, I want to first acknowledge the human cost of the catastrophes in the quarter. For those people whose lives have been affected around the world by the wind, fire, flood and earthquake experienced in the quarter, these are life-changing events, and this is always top of mind for us at Everest.  
As insurers and reinsurers, we are here as these communities work to rebuild, recover and hopefully emerge even stronger. And for Everest, this is when our ability to execute really matters. Turning to the results for the third quarter. The strength and resilience of our fundamentals continues to prove our strategy is working and our execution is on pace. As we shared during the June Investor Day, we measure our success against the 3-year strategic plan with a simple goal: create value and drive meaningful shareholder returns over time.  
This starts by ensuring that our reinsurance and insurance businesses supported by our investment portfolio are doing exactly what we said they would do, drive forward momentum to fuel profitable growth.  
At our core, Everest is a growth company, focused on sustained profitability with a well-diversified earnings stream. Beginning with our Insurance division, which delivered record high quarterly top line growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in gross written premium and the lowest attritional combined ratio to date. We continue to prove our relevance in the market and our ability to execute. There's significant runway ahead of us to grow profitably, and we're capitalizing on it.  
We're well on our way to growing into the world-class specialty global insurer we've set out to be. Reinsurance delivered double-digit growth, and we continued to further diversify our book across lines and geographies around the world, a key part of our disciplined strategy to reduce volatility. This discipline was evident in the previously announced third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $635 million from Hurricane Ida and the July European floods, events totaling over $40 billion in industry insured losses.  
Everest does not immune to the cat losses, but the cumulative, deliberate and purposeful actions we have taken to reduce volatility have changed our company's risk profile.  
We have taken a disciplined approach to diversifying our book and reducing reliance on a single peak cat zone. For example, we have reduced our PMLs for Southeast wind to almost half of what they were in 2017 from 11% to 5.9% of equity. We have scaled back our total property cat XOL premium, which comprises 17% of our total reinsurance premium today versus 26% at the end of 2017.  
Our book is better positioned and less volatile today than it was 2 years ago. We will continue to thoughtfully manage our risk profile to maximize returns.  
Turning to investments. Performance here was excellent. We continued to optimize our portfolio and its earnings power as a key diversifier of our earnings. Prudent capital management is another important part of our strategy. Just after quarter end, we completed an opportunistic $1 billion debt raise at a 3.125 coupon. This is very efficient long-term capital. In addition, we continue to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the quarter for a total of $200 million year-to-date.  
If the engines of our strategy, our core underwriting platforms supported by our investment portfolio, our transformation efforts focused on operational excellence and underwriting discipline are the fuel for those engines. During a quarter when the industry sustained meaningful losses from catastrophes, this discipline made a material difference in our financial outcome. It is about commitment to consistent execution and building a company for the long term.  
Throughout the third quarter, we saw the benefit of this commitment manifest in several ways. We continue to prove we can play offense in a favorable market to pivot and respond to changing market conditions. We're executing on a value proposition that continues to be well received by our customer and broker partners. We have the talent and capabilities to deepen distribution relationships and diversify our presence in key markets around the world. We have established our purpose-driven culture as a differentiator. We also see it in the top industry talent who have joined the Everest and who viewed the company as a great environment for development and opportunity.  
With that, let's dive into more detail around our results this quarter at the group and segment level. Beginning with our group results. Growth in the third quarter continued to be strong and diversified across both of our businesses. We grew gross written premiums by 25%, a barometer of our market relevance. The increase in premiums was a product of our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions, driving exposure growth and new business opportunities, the favorable double-digit rate environment and high renewal retention.  
The combined ratio of 112 includes $635 million of pretax net catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida and the European floods during the quarter. The group attritional combined ratio of 87.9 reflects strong underlying profitability in insurance and our continued diversification in reinsurance, coupled with ongoing prudence in loss pick selection. Catastrophe losses during the third quarter resulted in an underwriting loss of $323 million. Net investment income for the quarter was again outstanding, up 25% to $293 million, and the expense ratio also improved this quarter. 
The meaningful progress this quarter is not a sprint, it's about consistency day by day, quarter by quarter, being thoughtful and strategic about developing the portfolio, prudently managing expenses and pursuing overall operational excellence. These actions all add up. The cumulative effect is evident in our year-to-date results and a few are worth highlighting now. Year-to-date gross written premiums are up 24%. Our businesses continued to drive strong growth and momentum. We generated close to $1 billion in net income year-to-date. This is a testament to the earnings power of the company.  
Net investment income year-to-date has more than doubled from $420 million for the period last year to close to $1 billion today. Our expenses continued to improve and the group attritional combined ratio is also trending better year-to-date. Finally, for the 9 months year-to-date, annualized total shareholder return on equity is over 13%.  
With that, I'd like to turn to the results in our reinsurance business. We had another excellent growth quarter in our Reinsurance division with gross written premiums up 19%. We strengthened the franchise through underwriting actions to create a more diversified, resilient and lower volatility business. The growth was broad and diversified.  
Every geography and targeted line saw continued expansion in the quarter. The combined ratio of 115 includes the impact of third quarter pretax net catastrophe losses of $555 million from Hurricane Ida and the European floods. Our focused actions to derisk our portfolio are reflected in these results. The share of our book exposed to cat losses has declined. Diversification is key because the severity and frequency of these events are a reality. We see the impact of climate change in our data, and we take a proactive and scientific approach to how we model and underwrite for it. Our dedicated team of experts continuously assess the signs and integrate its effect on loss cost into our models. This focus will continue to be a key part of our strategy.  
Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter was 87%, including an attritional loss ratio of 60. Our attritional loss pick reflects our deliberate and targeted shaping of our portfolio to maximize results. This includes a higher mix of pro rata structures and an improved balance of property and casualty exposures. These underwriting actions positioned Everest to benefit from the underlying rate increases and improving terms and conditions achieved by our core cedents in the primary market.  
Combined with continued prudent loss picks, this results in a relatively higher attritional loss ratio but with better long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital. As you know, the primary market has benefited from multiple quarters of strong rate improvement, a reduction in limits and the strengthening of terms and conditions. Our strategy of focusing growth on core trading partners means we're benefiting from these effects alongside some of the industry's best underwriters, and we expect strong portfolio economics to emerge.  
Risk-adjusted return expectations are improving in every line, in every geography. At the same time, we remain vigilant regarding market trends, including climate change, supply constraints and social and material inflation. As a result, we continue to hold prudent loss picks. Finally, Mt. Logan continues to be an important part of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have brought in John Modin as its new leader. Jim Williamson is available to provide additional details during the Q&A.  
Now for our Insurance division. Performance continued to be strong with exceptional growth in expanding underlying margins. In the third quarter, we wrote over $1 billion in gross written premium for the second quarter in a row and achieved the highest quarterly growth rate to date at 43%. The growth in Insurance was fueled by a few factors: Number one, we continue to seize opportunities from increasingly favorable economic conditions. Second, we continue to grow through new business and demonstrate our relevance to customers and brokers. Third, we're benefiting from strong retention rates. This coupled with continued favorable, double-digit rate increases is creating the kind of opportunity Everest was built for and that we're poised to capitalize on.  
We maintain a strong focus on portfolio management as an important part of our strategy and driver of long-term profitability. We continue to proactively position the company to play offense and react nimbly to market conditions by driving our business mix stores product lines with better rate adequacy and higher long-term margins.  
Renewal rate increases continued to exceed our expectations for loss trend, up 12% in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation, and up 8%, including workers' compensation, which now represents 12% of our overall portfolio with monoline comp down to only 7%. Rate increases were led by excess casualty, up 17%; and financial lines, up 14%. I've said it before, those who execute best in this business win and the quality of growth in Insurance and our focused discipline comes down to simply excellent execution.  
During the third quarter, we expanded attritional underwriting margins with improvements in loss and expense ratios. This includes a 2 percentage point improvement in our attritional loss ratio of 62.9% and an improvement to 14 in the operating expense ratio. This resulted in the division's lowest attritional combined ratio to date at 90.3, an almost 4-point improvement over the same period last year.  
The underwriting loss of $17.2 million in the quarter was a result of the impact of pretax net catastrophe losses, including $80 million for Hurricane Ida. However, the year-to-date underwriting profitability shows the indicative strength of our portfolio and ability to execute. 
We have a long runway in front of us, and we're investing in the talent, the systems and our worldwide capabilities to make us better, more efficient and more relevant in the market. Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details during the Q&A. Reflecting on the progress we made against our long-term objectives, it is evident we're working with the right formula for success.  
Everest management team has the level of focus, deep expertise, an entrepreneurial approach to take us on our path forward and bring this even further. I am proud of the work we're doing, building on a strong inclusive culture that is constantly delivering for our clients and for our partners, pushing the envelope in digital innovation and our commitments as good corporate citizens. The opportunities are there, and Everest is well positioned to seize them.  
Now I will turn it over to Mark Kociancic to take us through the numbers in more detail. Mark?"
340813,1682221221,2415623,"Everest Re Group, Ltd., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Everest Group, Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter",1388,"Thank you, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Everest continued to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan and remains well on track to achieve its objectives. I'll discuss these topics in a few minutes, but first, a recap of the third quarter results. For the third quarter of 2021, Everest reported gross written premium of $3.5 billion, representing 25.3% growth over the same quarter a year ago. By segment, Reinsurance grew 19.2% to $2.5 billion and Insurance once again reported gross written premium of $1 billion in the quarter, representing 43.2% year-over-year growth. 
Year-to-date, the group's gross written premium was $9.6 billion, up 24.4% compared with the $7.7 billion figure from the first 9 months of 2020. Turning to net income. Net income results for the quarter were impacted by the global cat events seen worldwide, particularly Hurricane Ida in the U.S. and European flooding in Germany and Belgium. As a result, for the third quarter, Everest reported a net loss of $73 million and a net operating loss of $53 million, equal to negative $1.88 and negative $1.34 per share, respectively. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, Everest reported net income of $948 million and operating income of $795 million, equal to $23.72 and $19.87 per common share, respectively. Everest reported $635 million in net catastrophe losses during the quarter, as detailed in our October 14 earnings press release. The manageable losses from these events are strong evidence of the material derisking of the portfolio over the past few years, that Jon described and as evidenced by our reduced PMLs. 
Importantly, these results were well within Everest's expectations from events of this magnitude and within our risk appetite. We also note that there is no prior period development in the cat losses this quarter. All are current accident quarter events. Beyond Ida and the European floods, there were a number of smaller events, which did not breach the Everest cat event threshold of $10 million per event. Our practice for reserving for these smaller events is to include them in our attritional loss ratio estimates. And as such, these events did not materially impact our Q3 attritional loss ratio selections. I also note we have not added to our COVID-19 incurred loss provision, which remains at $511 million, with the vast majority remaining as IBNR. 
Third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of our underwriting and portfolio management initiatives for the group. Our underlying attritional profitability remained strong during the third quarter. Excluding the catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums, prior year development and COVID-19 pandemic impact, the attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.9% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 59.3% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-to-date attritional loss ratio for the group was 60.6% compared with 60.2% a year ago, reflecting our overall mix of business shift to longer tail casualty lines. 
The attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.9% for the third quarter compared to 85.8% for the third quarter of 2020. And year-to-date, the attritional combined ratio for the group was 87.6% compared with 88% a year ago as commission and expense ratio improvements offset the attritional loss ratio movement. 
For insurance, the attritional loss ratio improved 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 62.9% compared with 64.8% in 2020. The attritional combined ratio for insurance improved 3.9 points during Q3 to 90.3% as compared to 94.2% over the same period a year ago, given the favorable attritional loss ratio improvement and the reduced expense ratio. Our U.S. Insurance business, which makes up the majority of the book continues to run very well with an attritional combined ratio in the high 80s. Turning to Reinsurance. Attritional losses in the Reinsurance segment were largely driven by changes to the mix of business, notably proportionately more casualty premium plus 4.8% year-over-year. As a result, the third quarter 2021 attritional loss ratio was 60.2% compared with 57.5% a year ago, and the attritional combined ratio for Reinsurance was 87.1% compared with 83% for the third quarter of 2020. 
The group's commission ratio of 21.2% for the third quarter was up 1 percentage point from 20.2% reported in Q3 2020, largely due to changes in the composition of our business mix with more pro rata property and casualty business, which has a higher commission ratio versus excess of loss. The group expense ratio was exceptional at 5.3% for the quarter and down a full point as compared with 6.3% a year ago. The expense ratio continues to benefit from our continued focus on expense management and the benefits of increased scale and efficiency from our operating model. 
For the third quarter, investment income once again produced an exceptional result of $293 million as compared to $234 million for Q3 2020. Alternative investments accounted for $170 million of income during the third quarter, largely due to increases in the reported net asset values of our diversified limited partnership investments, driven by the continued economic and financial markets recovery. As a reminder, Everest reports limited partnership income 1 quarter in arrears. So the current quarter results are based on the valuations as of June 30. Invested assets at the end of the third quarter totaled $27.8 billion compared with $27.1 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2021 and $25.5 billion at year-end 2020. Approximately 78% of our invested assets are comprised of a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with a duration of 3.3 years. 
The remaining investments are allocated to equities and other invested assets, which include private equity investments, cash and short-term investments. Our effective taxes on net income and operating income for the third quarter of 2021 were negative 16.2% and negative 21.4%, respectively. The variance from our estimated tax rate of 11% for the year was largely due to the geographic distribution of income impacted this quarter by the catastrophe losses, which were primarily underwritten on our U.S. domiciled entities. For the first 9 months of 2021, Everest generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow compared to $2.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2020, reflecting the strength of our premium growth year-over-year. And we also note that operating cash flow for the quarter was a record at approximately $1.2 billion. The Everest balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with ample capacity to continue to execute on market opportunities. Shareholders' equity was just under $10 billion at the end of the third quarter compared with $9.7 billion at year-end 2020. 
Our attractiveness as a counterparty was endorsed by the markets as evidenced by the debt raise in early October. Everest issued $1 billion of 31-year senior notes at a very attractive coupon of 3.125 lowering our cost of capital over the long term. With this additional capital, Everest's pro forma financial leverage at the end of Q3 is just above 20%, in line with our long-term target of 15% to 20%, and we will manage our leverage within this range as we continue to optimize our capital structure through the course of the strategic plan. 
And as with the offering from last year, we will deploy the proceeds into the business given the organic growth opportunities highlighted in our strategic plan and the current favorable underwriting environment. Everest repurchased 625,000 shares in the quarter for a total of $160 million. And year-to-date, the numbers are 791,000 shares and $200 million. Quarter end book value per share was $253.40 compared with $260.32 at the end of the second quarter, resulting from $100 million in the change in unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio, driven by changes in interest rates plus the quarterly net income result. 
And I want to close with an update on our progress towards the Everest total return or TSR target as detailed during our Investor Day. Through the third quarter of 2021, the TSR stands at 13.2% annualized on track to meet the 3-year TSR target of at least 13%. The fundamentals of our long-term value creation plan remains strong based on the diversified set of earnings streams.  Reinsurance, Insurance and investments, along with an efficient capital structure, we affirm our strategic plan assumptions and TSR target over the 3-year time frame as detailed in our June Investor Day. 
And with that, I'll now turn it back to Juan."

The way we look at our reserving And again, I think I've been pretty consistent about this since I started as a CEO here almost 2 years ago is we're very disciplined. 
As I mentioned in my remarks, we are also cognizant of the external environment whether it's social inflation, climate change, CPI-type inflation and everything that's out there right now. So we do prefer to let things seasoned over time before we take action and bring that down. However, you also saw in the insurance numbers this quarter, the improvement that we made in the loss ratio. And again, this is consecutive to prior quarters as well. And I would point the fact to, again, statements I've made in the past that it's not only about rate, it's about all the management actions day-to-day in the portfolio. How we look at individual books of business, how we shape that portfolio, how we manage that. How we focus our attention, our execution on lines of business that we believe have a higher potential for long-term margins. So all of that is built into that. And essentially, that is what you see reflected in the improvement in the loss ratio on an underlying basis for the Insurance division."

And again, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter -- loss",395,"Yes. Thanks, Mike. And again, this is Juan Andrade. Let me start, and then I'll ask Jim Williamson to add some color. To reiterate some of what I said in my prepared remarks, what you see happening in the reinsurance attritional ratio this quarter -- loss ratio this quarter is really the result of deliberate actions that we're taking, right?  And those are deliberate actions to accomplish really 3 things: Number one is to fully benefit from the strong market that we're seeing. We're seeing rates in long tail lines to be up, terms and conditions to have been improved, limits to have been shortened. 
And so as a result of that, we're growing in our pro rata structures in casualty alongside some of the best underwriters in the primary market. You see it in the supplement. Our casualty pro rata business was up 63% for the quarter. So that's indicative of how we're playing off and taking advantage of these market conditions there. 
The second thing for us that we're trying to accomplish is really this is part of our deliberate strategy to reduce volatility and diversify our book opportunistically in the lines of business that we believe can deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. That's the other part that you're seeing there right now. It's us purposely moving our book of business in a direction that we believe will give us long-term risk-adjusted returns on capital that are quite attractive. 
And the third part of it, and this is related to the answer that I just gave to Elyse, again, as I've said from the beginning, we are a disciplined underwriting company, and we do maintain prudent loss picks in light of the external environment. So what you are seeing is that particularly the long tail lines will carry essentially higher loss picks than the short tail lines. And as we move that business over, this is the end result that you will see but with an outcome that we expect to return much better margins in the future while reducing the volatility of the company. 
The bottom line is we feel very good about the portfolio that we're creating right now and the embedded margin that we're creating. And we also feel very good about this being able to achieve the targets that we laid out on Investor Day and that Mark just affirmed."

The only thing I would add to what Juan had said and really only to add some additional color is, we obviously are very close to our core cedents who are driving the really strong growth that we've had in areas like casualty pro rata. And when you unpack their results in terms of what they're seeing from a rate change perspective, their ability to reduce limit profiles to improve terms and conditions. These are not subtle changes. These will have a dramatic impact, obviously, on the quality of the book that we have today, and we're very excited about that. And our expectation is that those conditions will persist. And so we want to continue to partner with those core cedents as they move through this market. 
But the last thing I would add, obviously, is we remain very flexible. And where we see good risk-adjusted returns, we're absolutely willing to shift our mix quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, and we will retain that flexibility as we move forward."

It's not a strategy related to that. It's really about pursuing best risk-adjusted returns.

So obviously, our cat budget and our cat planning exercise within the operating plan is modeled out based on expected losses. Clearly, there's been substantial volatility over several of the years, not all of them. Last year was a bit more modest, actually below plan. The 7% is how it works out mechanically between Reinsurance and Insurance. Having said that, we have taken our cat portfolio and reduced its risk profile over the years since -- essentially since Harvey, Irma, Maria back in 2017. And so that derisking that we've taken has been quite conscious. 
And alternatively, the group, and I think you saw this highlighted during the Investor Day is really expanding in other non-cat lines of business.

Let me address that, Brian, and then I'll invite both Mark and Jim to also add their points of view on it. Look, I think it's important to recognize what inflation means to the industry versus what we see in the CPI index and the headline news that's out there. I think it's undeniable that we are in a period of inflationary pressure from a purely CPI perspective. You see it in our goods. You see the upsurge in demand, the restriction in supply that's going on up there. And you definitely see a part of that. And it's manifested in used car values and chips and all of these things that are out there basically. 
From our perspective, we monitor from the asset and the liability side. On the liability side of our balance sheet, we're specifically focused on wage inflation, and also on health care inflation, the cost of medical care, basically. Those are critical things that we watch very carefully. Now your question on how that translates into how we think about loss picks, et cetera, is excellent because that is part of the analysis that we do on a quarterly basis. 
When we're looking at our loss picks and frankly, when we're doing our bridging for future year plans and when we're doing our reserve studies, et cetera, we try to build in those inflationary pressures into our numbers. And it's one of the reasons why we keep pushing for pricing and why we believe that this pricing environment will continue for at least another year, if not longer, for the longer-tail classes of businesses. The other thing that's important to recognize is that also on the liability side, there are some mitigants in the book, right? 
So if you think about exposure rated lines like general liability, workers' compensation, et cetera, those will rise also with the impact of inflation. And so there's some hedges that are built into that. But the primary hedge for us is how we look at our loss picks and how we do the analysis on a quarterly basis. When we look at the asset side of the balance sheet that's also how we position our portfolio to make sure that we're as fire proofed as possible and why we maintain the liquidity that. But let me ask Mark to add some commentary on the asset side, and then I'll invite Jim Williamson to talk a little bit more on the liability side."

Look, on the asset side, this is something we think about because it's unclear how permanent or transitory, the inflationary pressure that we're seeing is going to be going forward. And so we've got our portfolio -- the asset portfolio positioned such that we think it can react reasonably well versus a high inflation environment. And so there's a high degree of liquidity as well that augments the kind of cash demands that you would have in a high-inflation scenario. We benefit from shorter-term asset duration and a relatively short duration on the liability portfolio plus a significant amount of assets in exposed to equities or floating rate debt, which should be somewhat immunized in a high-inflation environment. 
The other piece that I'll add maybe before Jim steps in, is we have stressed the liability portfolio for different inflation scenarios and to see how it would perform in our ability to absorb it. And so that's something we do in addition to the reserving side, the assumptions, et cetera, is to see how it can perform in different types of environments."

I'll just address the second part of your question related to any bounce back that we may be seeing in our data related to the reopening of courts and frankly, the reopening and growth in the economy. And I think there is a degree of bounce back occurring. We certainly see it in areas like liability frequencies. We see it in medical utilization. It's not a tremendous effect, but it's also, I think, feeds into the rationale for being very consistent in how we set loss picks and not over responding to some of the good news that has come through in our data. And you waited for that to mature so that some of these transitory items like a bounce back in activity have time to play themselves out, and that's very consistent with our approach around loss selection."

And so when developed economies are down, emerging economies are up, and it's a good diversifying hedge from that perspective, in addition to the insurance market opportunity that's out there. Right now, we have a company out of Ireland that allows us to do business in the Continental Europe. We have our Lloyd's syndicate. And so we're able to utilize it as a platform for expansion in Europe and in the U.K. 
When you start thinking about expansion into Latin America and Asia, you are thinking more of a greenfield-type opportunity at that point in time. And our plans are very much in motion right now to be able to grow that business organically. But it also goes back to the question that I was asked earlier in the call as to how does M&A potentially fit into all of this? And our strategy is organic, as I said, but we're also mindful of any opportunities that may help to accelerate our progress as we move forward."

But every line of business grew, including workers' comp, which you cited as being slightly below trend, I guess, in terms of performance. 
And given what we're seeing pricing certainly isn't up yet in workers' comp. Can you talk a little bit about the growth in workers' comp, which wasn't tremendous, but it was still growth in a pricing environment that may not be particularly favorable."

Yes, the growth in comp is -- there's a big part of that, the exposure change that's coming from just the payrolls and obviously people going back to work. And then the other piece to keep in mind is a big part of our business that's been growing is in the loss ratable and that loss sense is loss ratable business on the risk management side. So we continue to do the same thing we talked about as being very disciplined around our monoline guaranteed cost comp. So again, most of that growth is just coming from specifically the overall exposure change?"

And I think, Josh, what I would add to that, again, is keep in mind what we've said in the past, not only have we deprioritized to growth in workers' compensation for what we've said and what you pointed out in your question. But within workers' compensation, our focus has really been more on the loss ratable risk management-type business where we can actually get better pricing than the monoline. And that's one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks, I emphasized the fact that while comp overall is now down to only 12% of the portfolio, monoline is down to only 7% of the portfolio, right? So it's important to understand that nuance within comp at the same time."

So at the beginning of the quarter and also in September. And if I could just add, Josh, sorry, it's Mark speaking. If I could just add a couple of points, we made it pretty clear during the Investor Day that we felt we could get a more efficient capital structure, and part of that is increasing the debt leverage of the company into a 15% to 20% range. 
And when you look at the kind of print that we got, the 3.125 coupon, that's very low long-term capital cost. So for us, the combination of issuing the debt and using that to fund future growth expansion is really a function of providing a lower cost of capital for that organic growth in line with, I think, what is a more conventional capital structure with something closer to 20% debt leverage.
I think the share buybacks, that's really look, a function of our confidence in our business. I wouldn't read too much else into it. The volatility that we had from the cats is something that we expect in this business. It was very much in our risk appetite. It never dissuaded us from any kind of capital management actions. And so we move forward here with a lot of confidence, and that was one of the points I was trying to make towards the end of my monologue regarding the affirmation of our plan, assumptions, the target and the path that we're on. 
We feel like there's an excellent opportunity in front of us. We're built for it. We're executing. There's a lot of momentum."
