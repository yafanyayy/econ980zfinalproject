First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we're pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout.

First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we're pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we're prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term, and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It's why I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic, we have stayed focused on our unique advantages, and we've been resolute in fueling innovation, and our brand is as strong as ever. 
I'm proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products, new campaigns, the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still, we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week, we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5-year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025, outlining clear goals, action plans and accountability. And for the first time, that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals. 
Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities, from sustainability to representation, to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately, this isn't just the right thing to do, it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value, raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense, accelerating our long-term strategy. And as I said, this continues to be a dynamic external environment, but I'm proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens, COVID spikes, forced enclosed -- store closures, port congestion on the West Coast and more, this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win. 
Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers' #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both men's and women's businesses. We're also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China, where our strong portfolio of brands, including Jordan and Converse, is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world, the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us, driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy. 
First, NIKE's connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon, having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbappé became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals, leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game was proved yet again of our dominance in basketball, with Lebron's team taking on KD's, Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan brand superstars led by Zion and Luca. And the energy of March Madness tips off today, with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 women's teams and 15 of the top 16 men's teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world. 
Second, our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We've had tremendous success in digital, quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries, NIKE's digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever, the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful. 
Third, we stay at the front of the pack, thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter, we announced the launch of Sneakers Live, our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3, we doubled the number of countries with live streaming, adding Japan, Germany and Italy. We're seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 year -- 15 minutes, I wish it were 15 years, well above the industry norms. We're also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community, content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether it's through the Sneakers app, our Activity apps, platforms like TikTok and more, we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital. 
And fourth, the Jordan brand had a very strong quarter, growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broad-based, led by our biggest growth opportunities: digital, international, apparel and women's. In fact, Jordan's women's business was up nearly triple digits, a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee, one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever, with more than $175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan brand moving forward. 
As always, our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovations at our core, reflecting not just our foundational values, but the values we share with consumers. We don't just innovate for the elite athlete, we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh, new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners. 
This quarter, we focused on a key problem for runners, with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The Zoom 10 Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running, with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape, a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape's silhouette, materials and design details are all aimed at new runners, and it's seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport. 
We're also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We've set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we'll continue to invest in new materials and methods to make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month, we launched Cosmic Unity, our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative, which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon, embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity, which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA's best, including Anthony Davis, is NIKE's first performance shoe made out of at least 25% recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. 
We're also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on, easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star, the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone, from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We're initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry and creating product through better consumer insights. 
This quarter, we acquired Datalogue, a data integration platform that will help us process, analyze and act on the data we enjoy, thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data, turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment, we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights, along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning, creates a capacity that no other brand has. 
Let's quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games, we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace, including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation, as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations. 
The last thing I'd like to discuss is digital. We're taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent, seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners, we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving, with growth of 54% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America, which had its first-ever quarter with $1 billion in digital revenue. 
As you know, we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered, being 50% of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date, increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKE's ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever, with an over 60% increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter, led by our Sneakers app, where we're seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We're seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80% versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores, member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases, enabled by robust store training programs, member specific promotions, and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active, high-value members across all of our channels. 
In the end, NIKE is staying on offense, and we're focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook, led by digital, and everything we've seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long term, and we're not slowing down. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

As we've entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic related challenges, our focus has not wavered.

As we've entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic related challenges, our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future, the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. 
For example, in Q3, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand. In North America specifically, inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks, impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA, additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and/or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we're focused on what we can control: optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility, accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and observe our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. 
I am proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team's unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn't have said it any better, we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future. 
Now as I reflect on the third quarter, I want to highlight 2 important points. First, NIKE's brand momentum is as strong as ever, and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full price sales with lower markdown activity, and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season. At our core, NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies, growing revenue 42% on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year, with digital demand doubling versus fiscal '19. NIKE Digital grew 54%, led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90% versus the prior year. Women's drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter, including nearly 90% growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace, we are increasing NIKE's market share across our key markets. And last, the Jordan brand grew 15%, delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business, and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling to our deep consumer connections, our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms, NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality, sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio. 
Second, this quarter demonstrated how a more direct, digitally -- enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70% year-to-date, and our mix of owned and partnered digital now exceeds 35% of our total business. This quarter, we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal '22 and beyond, we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel, with digital mix increasing towards our 50% vision. 
NIKE Physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live, Rise and Unite, will create distinctive, authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale, while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly, they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities, as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new NIKE Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter, where member checkout rates reached 90%, paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal '22. 
As I've said before, this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter, NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points, being fueled by a higher mix of digital, which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead. During Q3 in North America, we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product marketing and service recommendations, ultimately increasing member buying frequency, basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct, member centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most. 
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 3% in Q3, declining 1% on a currency-neutral basis as NIKE Direct grew 16%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year, resulting from higher full price product margins, due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rates as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds. 
SG&A declined 7% in the quarter, as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions, along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% compared to 3.9% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up 70% versus the prior year. As a reminder, prior year EPS included a $0.25 noncash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America. 
With that, let's turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However, starting in late December, container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply, delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct, however, grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50%, and we have seen this momentum continue into March. This quarter, we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand, inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. 
Inventory in North America grew 31% versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20%. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year, we expect continued full price momentum, despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 9% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe, government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures, with approximately 45% of our NIKE owned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane, to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April, we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal '22. 
As of today, approximately 35% of our NIKE owned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened, we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum, with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth versus year-over-year, complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE owned and partner stores mostly closed, we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business, which grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, led by the NIKE App, which grew triple digits in the quarter and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which achieved its second consecutive $2 billion quarter and grew 42% on a currency-neutral basis, with EBIT growth of 75% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 52% versus the prior year, with more than 40% growth in digital and nearly 60% growth in NIKE owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal, including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores, widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier, Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense, we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment, including the Dunk Low and the women's Dunk Disrupt, which both instantly sold out. Our women's business grew more than 60% versus the prior year, and our 2 new NIKE Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital, we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms, including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year, we doubled our number of high-value members. We also -- while also increasing member retention. We're excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China, including in the local consumer digital experience, new retail concepts and omnichannel integration with our owned and partner stores. 
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model, partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q3 EBIT grew 5% versus the prior year, on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly 70% on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan, we drove record weeks of member buying, launched our interactive live streaming on sneakers and activated new O2O capabilities. In Mexico, we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal '22. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history, and Q3 was no exception. Despite these continued challenges, we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the near-term operating environment with increasing clarity, yet we remain focused on what's required to win for the long term. With that in mind, we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year. Specifically for Q4, in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth of roughly 75% versus the prior year. This reflects government-mandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the continued shifts we've seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA.  Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly 35 basis point headwind on the full year. 
We expect SG&A dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards pre-pandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year. And finally, we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth, which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '22, as I said earlier, we are already exceeding our pre-pandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal '22 on our next earnings call. As a growth company, our offense is working. NIKE's brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating. The pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply, more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately, also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKE's long-term potential has never been higher. And so with that, let's open up the call for questions."

Well, as I mentioned, we saw times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand",222,"Sure. Well, as I mentioned, we saw times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We've now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year, but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. 
I mentioned, Bob, in my prepared remarks, that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And we're seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail, which is our strategic partners than we're seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today, it's down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct, and we continue to -- we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations."

Obviously, that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG&A for the year at up low singles, and now you're saying up slightly, while you're raising revenue growth, but you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there, too. So I'm trying to put the -- just at a high level, the picture together. It seems like there's either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID, longer-term or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG&A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there? Why you keep raising the revenue line?"

Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren't going to be linear as compared to where we've been in prior quarters, nor will",628,"Sure. Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren't going to be linear as compared to where we've been in prior quarters, nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels, I need to start with the core principle, which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us, we are poised and in a position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. 
Now in the middle of COVID, we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly -- and from a disciplined perspective, manage our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy, like our tech -- end-to-end tech transformation, digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so we've continued to do that while we've been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we're in. As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic, we don't intend to just add it back in, okay? Every dollar we're putting back in, we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so we're taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point, historically, prior to COVID, we were at about 33% of revenue in terms of our SG&A levels, and we've been able to manage through the last -- the first 3 quarters of this year, closer to 29%. 
And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period. The reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that, demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID, we were at something like 9% or 10% of revenue, and it fell to about 7% in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don't think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half, our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won't get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time, but we believe that that's the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery. So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring, we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time of the product was available in the marketplace. 
We're going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Women's, we're going to continue to be investing internationally, as I mentioned, against -- we're going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term, Michael, that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And the would be a source of leverage over time."

You speak about the physical store strategy globally. It sounds like there's a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America, a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model, and you've made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the -- I'm curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business, but you still do have strategic partners through -- with stores through the U.S. In the past, we've seen you segment by House of Hoops, Track Club, the big installations at DICK's Sporting Goods, those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when -- if you're going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores, into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business?"

And they want a seamless premium digital and physical experience. In fact, in many cases, they don't see a difference between digital and physical, whether they bought it not digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and pick it up in store, whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence, both ours and our partners. And the way we'll go forward is we are driving, starting with our own digital and our own stores, the seamless premium experience that's centered on the member, where we know who the member is, that member expects us to know who they are, whether they're in our stores or our partner stores. And so we'll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver very seamless experience, a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One NIKE marketplace will allow us to have consumers to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. 
And so as we segment, it's we're leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again, I think you'll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience."

I'm on my, I guess, 14th month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with THE Nike, Jordan and Converse brands, and frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior -- to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising -- these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it's quite powerful. And we're probably further along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. 
But they're also leading on that seamless experience. An example I'll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they're getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers and physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they're not -- they're completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers, brand-wise, but also that when we talk about the consistent premium, seamless experience, online to offline to deliver consumers, we're furthest along. We're furthest along in China, and I give that team huge credit, and we're rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions."

But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter, and it continues to have significant impact, not only on localizing product but also -- localizing product, but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. 
And then, Erinn, maybe one other indication vis-à-vis China being ahead of other places, as the world has opened up, sport is returning. And so just the energy that we're seeing with sport returning, we're seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market, and it gives us a lot of optimism as we're looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America, Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America, what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans, and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we've been seeing year-to-date.

And Matt, why don't I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On -- Omar on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is that the consumer-facing front,",576,"Great, Omar. And Matt, why don't I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On -- Omar on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is that the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what's possible, we're just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really -- has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. 
The secondary it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they've done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that's all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. 
By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you're the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our -- who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They're like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that's even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants. And so I'd say we're into our data journey, but there's so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it.
With respect to women's, the women's business is having a great momentum. It was the -- I think eighth straight quarter where women's growth out indexed overall growth. And that's across both NIKE and Jordan brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, [indiscernible] place retail grew to high double digits, and we're gaining share in women's, both on footwear and apparel. And while we're seeing success in women's to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we've described with a real dedicated and focused women's team, means that we can increase our investment. So we've doubled our investment in women's innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier. This React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it's just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women's business."

And they use machine learning to help automate translating raw data into critical actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you're beginning to see whether it's improved and personalized search results, whether you're seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it's anticipating on timing of when you're due for potentially some new footwear, some new apparel. 
Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it's what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, there are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don't want people, they don't want people know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, too, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that's one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we're going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said, scale matters, scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is -- it's true in the technology industry. It's also true, I think, in our industry, and so we'll have a scale advantage in data.

All of those things will result in, and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking -- is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise, as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end, there's going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today.

First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we're pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we're prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term, and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It's why I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. 
The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic, we have stayed focused on our unique advantages, and we've been resolute in fueling innovation, and our brand is as strong as ever. 
I'm proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products, new campaigns, the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still, we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week, we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5-year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025, outlining clear goals, action plans and accountability. And for the first time, that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals. 
Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities, from sustainability to representation, to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately, this isn't just the right thing to do, it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value, raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. 
Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense, accelerating our long-term strategy. 
And as I said, this continues to be a dynamic external environment, but I'm proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens, COVID spikes, forced enclosed -- store closures, port congestion on the West Coast and more, this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win. 
Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers' #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both men's and women's businesses. We're also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China, where our strong portfolio of brands, including Jordan and Converse, is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world, the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us, driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy. 
First, NIKE's connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon, having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbappé became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals, leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball, with Lebron's team taking on KD's, Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today, with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 women's teams and 15 of the top 16 men's teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world. 
Second, our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We've had tremendous success in digital, quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries, NIKE's digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever, the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful. 
Third, we stay at the front of the pack, thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter, we announced the launch of SNKRS Live, our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3, we doubled the number of countries with live streaming, adding Japan, Germany and Italy. We're seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 year -- 15 minutes, I wish it were 15 years, well above the industry norms. We're also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community, content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether it's through the SNKRS App, our Activity apps, platforms like TikTok and more, we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital. 
And fourth, the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter, growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broad-based, led by our biggest growth opportunities: digital, international, apparel and women's. In fact, Jordan's women's business was up nearly triple digits, a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee, one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever, with more than $175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward. 
As always, our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovation's at our core, reflecting not just our foundational values, but the values we share with consumers. We don't just innovate for the elite athlete, we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners. 
This quarter, we focused on a key problem for runners, with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running, with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape, a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape's silhouette, materials and design details are all aimed at new runners, and it's seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport. 
We're also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We've set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we'll continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month, we launched Cosmic Unity, our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative, which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon, embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity, which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA's best, including Anthony Davis, is NIKE's first performance shoe made out of at least 25% recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. 
We're also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on, easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star, the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone, from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We're initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights. 
This quarter, we acquired Datalogue, a data integration platform that will help us process, analyze and act on the data we enjoy, thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data, turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment, we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights, along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning, creates a capacity that no other brand has. 
Let's quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games, we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace, including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation, as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations. 
The last thing I'd like to discuss is digital. We're taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent, seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners, we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving, with growth of 54% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America, which had its first-ever quarter with $1 billion in digital revenue. 
As you know, we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered, being 50% of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date, increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKE's ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever, with an over 60% increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter, led by our SNKRS App, where we're seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We're seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80% versus the prior year. 
And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores, member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases, enabled by robust store training programs, member-specific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active, high-value members across all of our channels. 
In the end, NIKE is staying on offense, and we're focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook, led by digital, and everything we've seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long term, and we're not slowing down. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

As we've entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges, our focus has not wavered.

As we've entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges, our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future, the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. 
For example, in Q3, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand. In North America specifically, inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks, impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA, additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and/or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we're focused on what we can control: optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility, accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. 
I am proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team's unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn't have said it any better, we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future. 
Now as I reflect on the third quarter, I want to highlight 2 important points. First, NIKE's brand momentum is as strong as ever, and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full-price sales with lower markdown activity, and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season. 
At our core, NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies, growing revenue 42% on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year, with digital demand doubling versus fiscal '19. NIKE Digital grew 54%, led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90% versus the prior year. Women's drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter, including nearly 90% growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace, we are increasing NIKE's market share across our key markets. And last, the Jordan Brand grew 15%, delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. 
We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business, and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling, to our deep consumer connections, our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms, NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality, sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio. 
Second, this quarter demonstrated how a more direct, digitally enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70% year-to-date, and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds 35% of our total business. This quarter, we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal '22 and beyond, we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel, with digital mix increasing towards our 50% vision. 
NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live, Rise and Unite will create distinctive, authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale, while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly, they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter, where member checkout rates reached 90%, paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal '22. 
As I've said before, this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter, NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points, being fueled by a higher mix of digital, which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead. 
During Q3 in North America, we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product, marketing and service recommendations, ultimately increasing member buying frequency, basket size and member retention rates. 
It is clear that our shift to a more direct, member-centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most. 
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 3% in Q3, declining 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 16%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. 
Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year, resulting from higher full price product margins, due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds. 
SG&A declined 7% in the quarter, as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions, along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% compared to 3.9% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up 70% versus the prior year. As a reminder, prior year EPS included a $0.25 noncash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America. 
With that, let's turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However, starting in late December, container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply, delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct, however, grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50%, and we have seen this momentum continue into March. 
This quarter, we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand, inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. 
Inventory in North America grew 31% versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20%. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year, we expect continued full price momentum, despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics. 
In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 9% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe, government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures, with approximately 45% of our NIKE-owned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April, we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal '22. 
As of today, approximately 35% of our NIKE-owned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened, we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum, with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth year-over-year, complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE-owned and partner stores mostly closed, we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business, which grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, led by the NIKE App, which grew triple digits in the quarter, and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which achieved its second consecutive $2 billion quarter and grew 42% on a currency-neutral basis, with EBIT growth of 75% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 52% versus the prior year, with more than 40% growth in digital and nearly 60% growth in NIKE-owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal, including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores, widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. 
As I mentioned earlier, Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense, we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment, including the Dunk Low and the women's Dunk Disrupt, which both instantly sold out. Our women's business grew more than 60% versus the prior year, and our 2 new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. 
In digital, we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms, including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year, we doubled our number of high-value members. We also -- while also increasing member retention. We're excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China, including in the local consumer digital experience, new retail concepts and omnichannel integration with our owned and partner stores. 
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model, partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q3 EBIT grew 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly 70% on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan, we drove record weeks of member buying, launched our interactive live streaming on SNKRS and activated new O2O capabilities. In Mexico, we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal '22. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history, and Q3 was no exception. Despite these continued challenges, we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the near-term operating environment with increasing clarity yet we remain focused on what's required to win for the long term. With that in mind, we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year. 
Specifically for Q4, in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth of roughly 75% versus the prior year. This reflects government-mandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the continued shifts we've seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA. Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly 35 basis point headwind on the full year. 
We expect SG&A dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards pre-pandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year. And finally, we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth, which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration. 
Looking ahead to fiscal '22, as I said earlier, we are already exceeding our pre-pandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal '22 on our next earnings call. 
As a growth company, our offense is working. NIKE's brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating, the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply, more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately, also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKE's long-term potential has never been higher. And so with that, let's open up the call for questions."

Well, as I mentioned, we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We've now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year, but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. 
I mentioned, Bob, in my prepared remarks, that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And we're seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail, which is our strategic partners, than we're seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today, it's down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct, and we continue to -- we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations."

Obviously, that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG&A for the year at up low singles, and now you're saying up slightly, while you're raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there, too. So I'm trying to put the -- just at a high level, the picture together. It seems like there's either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer-term, or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG&A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line?"

Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren't going to be linear as compared to where we've been in prior quarters, nor will",629,"Sure. Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren't going to be linear as compared to where we've been in prior quarters, nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels, I need to start with the core principle, which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us, we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. 
Now in the middle of COVID, we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly -- and from a disciplined perspective, managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy, like our tech -- end-to-end tech transformation, digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so we've continued to do that while we've been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we're in. 
As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic, we don't intend to just add it back in, okay? Every dollar we're putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so we're taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point, historically, prior to COVID, we were at about 33% of revenue in terms of our SG&A levels, and we've been able to manage through the last -- the first 3 quarters of this year, closer to 29%. 
And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period. The reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that, demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID, we were at something like 9% or 10% of revenue, and it fell to about 7% in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don't think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half, our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won't get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time, but we believe that that's the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery. 
So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring, we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. 
We're going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Women's, we're going to continue to be investing internationally, as I mentioned, against -- we're going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term, Michael, that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time."

You speak about the physical store strategy globally. It sounds like there's a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America, a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model, and you've made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the -- I'm curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business, but you still do have strategic partners through -- with stores through the U.S. 
In the past, we've seen you segment by House of Hoops, Track Club, the big installations at DICK's Sporting Goods, those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when, if you're going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business?"

And they want a seamless, premium digital and physical experience. In fact, in many cases, they don't see a difference between digital and physical, whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store, whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence, both ours and our partners. 
And the way we'll go forward is we are driving, starting with our own digital and our own stores, the seamless premium experience that's centered on the member, where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are, whether they're in our stores or our partner stores. And so we'll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience, a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. 
And so as we segment, it's -- we're leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again, I think you'll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience."

I'm on my, I guess, 14th month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands. And frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior -- to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising -- these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it's quite powerful. And we're probably furthest along in the world on that in China. 
And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. 
But they're also leading on that seamless experience. An example I'll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they're getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they're not -- they're completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers, brand-wise, but also that when we talk about the consistent premium, seamless experience, online to offline, that deliver consumers, we're furthest along. We're furthest along in China, and I give that team huge credit, and we're rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions."

And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter, and it continues to have significant impact, not only on localizing product but also -- localizing product, but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. 
And then, Erinn, maybe one other indication vis-à-vis China being ahead of other places, as the world has opened up, sport is returning. And so just the energy that we're seeing with sport returning, we're seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market, and it gives us a lot of optimism as we're looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America, Europe and other places. 
Specifically on your question about North America, what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans, and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we've been seeing year-to-date.

And maybe if you could update us on where women's is in the mix and how big that maybe that could be over time."

And Matt, why don't I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On -- Omar, on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain.

On -- Omar, on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what's possible, we're just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really -- has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. 
The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they've done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that's all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. 
By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you're the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our -- who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They're like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that's even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants. 
And so I'd say we're into our data journey, but there's so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it.
With respect to women's, the women's business is having a great momentum. It was the -- I think eighth straight quarter where women's growth out indexed overall growth. And that's across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, marketplace retail, grew to high double digits, and we're gaining share in women's, both on footwear and apparel. 
And while we're seeing success in women's to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we've described with a real dedicated and focused women's team, means that we can increase our investment. So we've doubled our investment in women's innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier, this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it's just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women's business."

And they use machine learning to help automate, translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you're beginning to see whether it's improved and personalized search results, whether you're seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it's anticipating timing of when you're due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. 
Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it's what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don't want people, they don't want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, and two, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that's one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we're going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. 
And as you said, scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is -- it's true in the technology industry. It's also true, I think, in our industry, and so we'll have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt, do you want to comment, add to that?"

And where you'll see it drive financial value through our P&L is making better pricing and merchandising decisions, where we place our inventory, how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in, and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking -- is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. 
And then I think more broadly as an enterprise, as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end, there's going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think you'll also see productivity in SG&A over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion.

Looking at Q4 and the full fiscal year we just concluded, our strong business results proved yet again NIKE's unique competitive advantage. Our relentless focus on our objectives is clear and our strategy is working. We're excited by the momentum we continue to see. 
In Q4, we saw growth of over 95%, which translates to 19% growth for the fiscal year. This full year growth was led by our own digital business, which has now more than doubled versus fiscal '19, prior to the pandemic. I've said before that these are times when strong brands can get stronger, and each quarter, this reality becomes even more clear. Today, we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro complexities while also building the future. 
We saw broad-based growth this quarter, led by North America at over 140%. Greater China's currency-neutral growth of 9% was impacted amidst marketplace dynamics with improving trends as we exited the quarter. One of NIKE's strengths is our diverse global portfolio. And through the power of that portfolio, we once again overdelivered on our expectations for the quarter. 
As we look ahead to fiscal '22, the opportunity ahead of us is significant. We remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. The structural tailwinds we've discussed before, including the return to sport and permanent shifts in consumer behavior towards digital and health and wellness continue to create energy for us. And we remain focused on our largest growth drivers, including our Women's business, apparel, Jordan and International. NIKE sets the pace through a continuous flow of new innovation, the world's greatest roster of athletes and compelling experiences for consumers that create lifelong relationships with our brand. Our strengths and proven playbook give us the confidence to move even faster to invest at even a more accelerated pace against the opportunities we see ahead. 
As the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel brand, we take seriously our leadership position to promote sport participation and an active lifestyle through inspiration and innovation. Our goal isn't merely to take market share. Our goal is also to grow the entire market. NIKE's growth has been and will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll walk through today: connecting with consumers through compelling brand experiences across NIKE, Jordan and Converse; driving product innovation against our greatest growth opportunities; and expanding our digital advantage. 
First, let's discuss how we serve consumers. As sport continues to return, NIKE leads with our unique rich heritage and our deep roster of global superstars and up-and-comers who connect us with consumers everywhere. Euro 2020 started 2 weeks ago with Cristiano Ronaldo becoming the leading scorer in Euro's history. England, France, Portugal and the Netherlands are among the teams with great momentum heading into the tournament's next stage. And we're proud that more goals have been scored, thus far, wearing NIKE boots than all other brands combined. On the club side, Chelsea won the Champions League on the men's side and Barcelona was the top team on the women's side. 
In the U.S. The WNBA season is underway with the Seattle Storm in first place, led by Sue Bird and Jewell Lloyd. And then the NBA, a captivating playoffs has showcased our unmatched rosters of the game's greatest players across NIKE and Jordan, including KD, LeBron, Luka, Jokic and several who are still in the hunt like Giannis, Chris Paul, Devin Booker and Paul George. 
And earlier this week, I was in Eugene for the U.S. track and field trials and got to see incredible performances from Sha'Carri, Richardson, Michael Norman, Ryan Crouser and many others. We remain excited for the power of sport on full display during the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo this summer and in Beijing next year. 
This authentic connection with consumers is also fueled by our belief in redefining how we open access to sports for consumers everywhere. A recent campaign, Play New, launched in May, kicking off our largest ever invitation to Gen Z and marking the ignition point of a month-long rally around finding joy and movement in play. We focus Play New on TikTok and Snapchat to show Gen Z vets, in their words, sport is a change accelerator. And their response has been remarkable. The app's augmented reality lenses featuring yoga, dance and surf led to more than 600 million Gen Z impressions in just the first 2 weeks. 
Earlier, I mentioned our goal to grow the market well by inspiring people to try something for the first time, we vastly expand the community of athletes. And we continue to bring the emotion and power of our brand to life through our digital ecosystem, which is led by the SNKRS App. In Q4, SNKRS grew over 90% in demand and saw a nearly 80% growth in monthly active users. We're now offering this growing audience of high-value members and almost daily flow of compelling content and product launches. 
For Air Max Day in March, 6 different livestream events gave SNKRS Live its highest viewership ever. So whether it's through SNKRS Live or user-generated style inspiration, SNKRS is the perfect intersection of content, community and commerce. 
Moving to my second point. Our relentless pipeline of innovative products continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our product is fueled by sharp consumer insight, supported by marketing data and analytics as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. And through our new operating model, we are bringing more position to the art of product creation as we blend the heart and science of innovation. 
For Q4, let me touch on 2 great examples of how we're investing in our top growth opportunities, our Women's business and Jordan Brand. We're investing and focused across the entire value chain to unlock the vast opportunity we see for Women's. For the full year, our Women's business drove outsized growth of 22% versus the prior year. And despite the tremendous momentum we're seeing in Women's, we know that there's even greater growth ahead as we move even faster with our new organization structure and invest far more resources and serving women end to end. 
For instance, in the marketplace, we continue to provide more compelling retail environment through our NIKE Live format. In fact, this past year, we opened 9 new NIKE Live doors, which offer personalized experiences and services for female consumers. Our investments also mean a larger sharper focus on women's-only insights, services and product innovation. And we're already seeing this work come to life. Consumer insight from our female consumer drove the new Pegasus 38, which kept the best cushioning innovations from this popular franchise while improving and tailoring comfort and fit that she wants. The Peg 38 has sold extremely well, and we continue to be energized by the potential we see in footwear for her. 
For the WNBA's 25th season this year, we created the most comprehensive player, team and fan apparel collection in league history. The new WNBA uniforms were completely reengineered to deliver the exact fit, movement and comfort players said that they want from their jersey and sport. The players love them and consumers have agreed with sales growth well above our expectations. And that heightened demand extended to the larger product assortment with the WNBA's 25th anniversary tee selling out in 1 day. This is just 1 example of how we drive energy for women's sport across the marketplace as we remain excited by this enormous opportunity looking forward. 
Next, let's discuss Jordan Brand, whose momentum continues to be driven by its unique blend of heritage and innovation as well as its deep connections to consumers and communities around the globe. In fiscal '21, Jordan Brand grew 31%, propelling the business to nearly $5 billion. This growth was driven by continued energy for Jordan's most coveted icons, including the AJ1 and AJ11 as well as new product dimensions. For example, Jordan's Women's business nearly tripled in Q4, fueled by compelling product, such as The Flight Essentials apparel collection. We are also increasingly are excited about our delivery of exclusive access for women through collabs like Aleali May's AJ1, which drove over 40% female buyers, more than 10 points higher than average AJ1 buyer profile. 
In Q4, Jordan also launched Zion Williamson's first signature shoe, the Zion 1, as well as the apparel collection. As the first Gen Z signature shoe in Jordan Brand's history, Zion offers both transcendent athletic possibility as well as a deep personal connection with fans. The strong sell-through of Zion's signature shoe collection demonstrates the continued love for Jordan Brands' roster of athletes all over the world. 
Quickly looking to the summer in Tokyo. In the next few weeks, we'll be officially launching more of our Olympic product, including our U.S.A. women's basketball and football uniforms, our 4 skateboarding federation kits and a new metal stand shoe featuring our hands-free FlyEase technology. We're excited by the strong reaction we've seen for our Olympic product thus far. 
And we're also thrilled to see our innovation continue to separate us. In running, this includes our Vaporfly Next% 2 for distance runners as well as our best-in-class track spikes. As you've probably heard, our spikes are creating dominant performances at the U.S. track and field trials, not just for NIKE athletes but competitor athletes as well. From performance to the metal stand to sustainability, we're excited for the world stage this summer in Tokyo to put a global spotlight on our advantage and innovation. 
One final observation on innovation. I recently got the chance to see the long-term product plans that our teams are developing against our new consumer construct of Women's, Men's, Kids and Jordan, with sharpness against sport performance and sport lifestyle, and I could not be more excited. It's safe to say that we're more confident than ever in our product pipeline as our focus on the consumer of the future drives our relentless innovation engine. And as we start welcoming employees back to work in our new state-of-the-art design and innovation centers, I know that our innovation pace will only quicken as we reinvent what's possible. 
My third and final point is increasing our digital advantage. As I said earlier, our owned digital business has more than doubled over the past 2 years to over $9 billion. And at the center of our digital ecosystem is our suite of apps, which in Q4 reflected over 40% of our owned digital business. This is the result of deeper consumer connections fueled by compelling product and content. 
A key differentiator for us is membership. It has proven to be a compelling driver of repeat engagement and buying across digital and physical retail. In Q4, we continued to see growth in member demand outpace total digital growth, hitting a new record of $3 billion. This member demand growth was underscored by strong results across the consumer funnel, including member engagement, average order value and buying frequency. In this fiscal year, we met the goals we set at our last Investor Day around membership a full year early and now have more than 300 million NIKE members. 
More importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new member growth, signaling progress on a deeper member-led commerce funnel. We're always looking to elevate our unique member proposition. Whether that means expanding the number of member exclusive products or creating new and meaningful retail experiences through member days, our NIKE-only retail moments. And this engaging membership experience fuels a virtuous cycle, feeding insight to product creation, inventory optimization and more. Knowing and serving our members drives greater competitive separation. 
Today, we're the clear leaders in our industry, and we continue to see digital as our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22. The combination of owned and partner digital revenue is now nearly 35% of our total business, more than 3 years ahead of our prior plan. And we see no sign of this shift slowing. In fact, we believe we will achieve 50% digital mix of business across owned and partnered in fiscal '25. 
As part of our overall One NIKE marketplace, we're also actively engaged with our strategic wholesale partners who share our vision. Today, we're working closely with large strategic partners like Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and JD Sports as well as compelling local neighborhood partners who are authentic to sport performance and lifestyle. Together, we are driving change to create a new more connected and seamless experience for consumers around the world, which is exactly what consumers want. It's a shift that speaks to our belief that the strong gets stronger. We're supercharging how we serve consumers with convenience, innovation, content and services. This is how we stay ahead of the pack and expand our lead. 
Finally, as we end our fiscal year, I want to thank our global NIKE teammates. We've all been through a lot this past year. And at NIKE, that's included store closures, supply chain challenges, a digital transformation, a new accelerated strategy and more. And throughout it all, our team has delivered for our consumers and communities, so I just want to take a moment as I close to recognize and personally thank our 75,000 NIKE teammates. You've demonstrated creativity, teamwork and resilience, and you are the reason NIKE leads. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, that people of NIKE are our greatest competitive advantage. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I too want to take a moment to thank our incredible team. They've delivered extraordinary results over the past year. I also want to take a moment and recognize Andy Muir. This will be her last earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations after recently becoming CFO of our Jordan Brand. Thank you, Andy, for your leadership, and specifically for your support in my transition to CFO last year. I wish you the best of luck in your new role. I know you'll do great. And backfilling Andy in this role is Paul Trussell, who many of you already know. Paul joins us from Deutsche Bank, and we're excited to welcome him to the NIKE team. 
Now I'd like to begin today's call with a baseline on where we are in our recovery. Just as we anticipated, NIKE is emerging from the pandemic stronger and better positioned to serve the consumer. And the reason for this is clear, NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling a deeper consumer connection with our brands and driving business results, all while highlighting greater strategic and financial opportunity ahead. 
Over the past 15 months, we have navigated through this challenging environment with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head on, focused on what we could control, all while keeping the consumer at the center. These actions have helped set a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability with business performance now exceeding prepandemic levels. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered over $12 billion of reported revenue, our largest quarter ever. Our NIKE Direct business is now approaching 40% of total NIKE Brand revenue. NIKE Digital represents 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, a milestone we've reached several years ahead of our prior plan. And finally, our fiscal '21 EBIT margin reached 15.5%, reflecting more than 300 basis points of expansion when compared to fiscal '19. These metrics now become the new baseline from which we expect to grow. 
As we recover from the global pandemic, it is clear that our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming NIKE's financial model. So later on the call, I will share our financial outlook through fiscal year '25, reflecting a more direct member-centric business model. However, first, I would like to provide additional detail on our extraordinary fourth quarter results and operating segment performance. 
NIKE, Inc.'s revenue increased 96% and 88% on a currency-neutral basis. This was driven by strong wholesale shipments and NIKE-owned store performance as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures. Even as physical retail reopened, we continued to see strong growth in NIKE Digital of 37% versus the prior year. Gross margin increased 850 basis points versus the prior year, driven by favorable NIKE Direct margins and the anniversary of higher costs, including actions taken to manage supply and demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. SG&A grew 17% versus the prior year due to higher levels of brand activity connected to return of sport, digital marketing to drive digital demand, technology investments to support our digital transformation and higher wage-related expenses. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6% compared to 1.7% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items in the prior year and a shift in earnings mix, primarily related to pandemic recovery. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.93 and full year diluted earnings per share was $3.56, up 123% versus the prior year. 
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 141%. This also marked the first ever $5 billion quarter for North America, driven by notable improvement in full price sell-through as the marketplace reopened and sport activity returned. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong. And as we expected, delayed revenue from the global supply chain disruption in the third quarter was recaptured during the fourth quarter. 
NIKE Direct grew over 120% as NIKE-owned stores returned to positive sales growth versus prepandemic levels. More importantly, NIKE Digital grew over 50%, while physical traffic continued to improve across the marketplace. NIKE Direct performance was propelled by our members across both digital and physical retail. Member demand nearly doubled versus the prior year, and the number of buying members grew roughly 80%. 
Across the total marketplace, we continue to see retail sales growth and consumer demand for our brands exceeding marketplace supply with marketplace inventory down double digits versus the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 7%, with double-digit declines in closeout inventory. 
In-transit full price inventory remains elevated as we continue to experience longer end-to-end lead times for supply. We expect supply chain delays and higher logistics costs to persist throughout much of fiscal '22. 
In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 107% on a currency-neutral basis with strong growth across the region, including the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany and Italy. NIKE Direct grew 57%, despite government restrictions requiring nearly half of our NIKE-owned stores to remain closed for the first 2 months of the quarter. 
In May, as restrictions eased, we saw a strong consumer response with incredible pent-up demand, and this momentum has continued into June. NIKE Digital grew nearly 30% versus the prior year. Through our member days, we saw strong engagement with member demand outpacing total NIKE Direct revenue growth with all-time highs for female active members during Air Max week. In the fourth quarter, we also expanded the NIKE mobile app to more than 10 new countries across the region. 
During our last earnings call, I shared our expectation that inventory in EMEA would normalize in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We have exceeded that goal due to stronger-than-anticipated consumer demand, ending fiscal '21 in a healthy and normalized inventory position. 
In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, Greater China delivered its seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth, demonstrating our consistent brand strength and commitment to serving the consumer. NIKE Direct grew 2% in Q4, with strong growth in NIKE-owned stores, partially offset by declines in NIKE Digital. 
As John mentioned earlier, Q4 business results were impacted by marketplace dynamics. After a strong March, our business in Greater China was impacted in April, and we adjusted our operations by suspending marketing activities and product launches. We then began to see a recovery trend, improving to a single-digit decline in May and sequentially improving into June with month-to-date retail sales trends approaching prior year levels. And for the 6/18 Consumer Moment, our flagship store on Tmall ranked #1, driving the highest demand across the sports industry. 
Building on our 40-year history in Greater China, we continue to invest in serving consumers with the best products Nike has to offer in locally relevant ways. We also continue to invest in the creation of a premium, seamless consumer digital experience and supply chain capabilities. And we plan to open a new digital technology center in Shenzhen to better serve Chinese consumers. 
We have an experienced local team in Greater China, who helped create our operational playbook at the beginning of the pandemic. They have proactively managed marketplace supply and demand in order to navigate through these dynamics, and we expect inventory to be normalized by the end of Q2. 
Now moving to APLA. Q4 revenue grew 76% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all territories, led by Japan, SoKo and Mexico. And Korea grew double digits this quarter on top of the 8% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter of last year. NIKE Digital grew more than 50%, enabled and amplified by our membership offense. This was highlighted by member days, which drove all-time highs for member demand. 
This momentum also extended to our marketplace partners in APLA as they return to growth versus prepandemic levels and achieved their highest level of full price realization since the beginning of the pandemic. 
During Golden Week in Japan, the Express Lane assortment was heavily influenced by member insights and delivered a sell-through rate that was 2x the rate of the rest of NIKE Digital in Japan, showcasing the power of blending art and science that John referenced earlier. APLA was the last geography to launch our Express Lane offense, and we see significant opportunity to leverage these capabilities to drive deeper, authentic consumer connections across the region. 
Now as we look ahead to fiscal '22 and beyond, I want to provide a new financial outlook through fiscal '25 as we emerge from the pandemic, accelerate our consumer direct strategy and transform the operating model of the company. 
First of all, NIKE is a growth company, and we expect to sustain strong revenue growth going forward. This is based on the significant market opportunity that we see for our brands across the portfolio as well as our accelerated shift to a more direct member-centric business model. As a result, we expect revenue growth to inflect upwards to a range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth on average with outsized marketplace opportunities in Women's apparel, Jordan, Digital and International. 
Growth will be led by NIKE Direct and our strategic marketplace partners. Earlier, I mentioned NIKE Direct is approaching 40% of our brand business today, and we expect it to represent approximately 60% of the business in fiscal '25, led by growth in digital. And as John said earlier, we expect owned-partner digital to achieve 50% business mix in fiscal '25 with NIKE-owned digital to represent 40% of the business. 
We will continue reshaping our wholesale business portfolio, which includes divesting from undifferentiated retail, while investing in our strategic wholesale partners for healthy growth. Overall, we expect wholesale revenue to remain roughly flat versus fiscal '21. We will support partners who continue to authenticate our brand as well as those who have the scale to create a consistent premium digitally connected experience for consumers across the marketplace. 
Our longer-term revenue outlook reflects higher growth expectations across several operating segments. We will continue to leverage the power of our diverse global portfolio. And we expect, on average, North America to grow mid-single to high single digits, EMEA to grow high single digits, and APLA to grow low double digits. And with respect to Greater China, while marketplace dynamics still exist, we are optimistic that we can continue to grow low to mid-teens over the long term. We remain committed to investing in the local consumer experience and inspiring the next generation of athletes in China. We will continue to serve consumers with NIKE's performance innovation and sports style product franchises, while also increasing local customization of style and fit for consumers. 
For several quarters now, I've highlighted that the strategic and financial benefit of shifting to a higher mix of business through NIKE Direct led by digital and leveraging enhanced data and analytics capabilities to optimize inventory, drive higher full price realization and lower digital fulfillment costs. 
We now see gross margin rate reaching the high 40s by fiscal '25. We will continue to reallocate resources and invest to enable our digital transformation and fuel the long-term growth and profitability opportunities that we see. Having said that, we expect to invest in SG&A at a rate that drives leverage versus prepandemic levels, which averaged roughly 32% to 33% of revenue. As a result of all of these, we see our EBIT margin reaching high teens by fiscal '25 with earnings per share growth of mid- to high teens on average over this period. 
As we drive towards a more direct business model, we remain committed to create long-term value for our shareholders through serving consumers and sustaining our disciplined financial management. We expect to deliver strong growth in free cash flow, maintain annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of revenue, drive returns on invested capital above prior guidance of the low 30% range and deliver consistent returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now that I've discussed our updated financial outlook through fiscal '25, I will provide guidance for fiscal '22. As I've already said, we entered the fiscal year strong, confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue despite being in a dynamic operating environment. Our confidence is rooted in the fact that consumers in key cities rate NIKE as their favorite brand. That retail sales continue to grow strongly on lean marketplace inventory, and our organization is aligned against our new consumer construct, which will help us accelerate even faster against our largest growth opportunities. 
In fiscal '22, we expect revenue to grow low double digits and surpass $50 billion, reflecting strong consumer demand across our operating segments as we lead with digital, scale NIKE-owned physical retail concepts and grow with our strategic partners. It's important to note, as we normalize our post-pandemic business and continue to reshape the marketplace, -- We do not expect quarter-by-quarter growth to be linear. Therefore, we expect first half growth to be slightly higher than second half growth. We expect gross margin to expand 125 to 150 basis points, reflecting our continued shift to a more profitable NIKE Direct business and sustained strong full price realization, partially offset by higher product costs, supply chain investments and the annualization of certain onetime benefits in fiscal '21. Foreign exchange is estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 70 basis points. We expect SG&A growth to slightly outpace revenue growth as we normalize spend with return to sport and more consistent store operating schedules as well as investments focused against our largest growth opportunities, which I have shared previously. However, we do expect leverage relative to prepandemic rates of investment. 
And last, we expect the fiscal '22 effective tax rate to be mid-teens. As we begin our next fiscal year, NIKE continues to navigate through a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. At the same time, we are on the offense and accelerating our strategy to serve more consumers personally and at scale. 
Our unmatched innovation continues to enable world-class athletes to reach new levels of performance as sport returns to the main stage. Our product pipeline is strong, and we are even more deeply connected to consumers than before the pandemic. 
We are building upon the strong foundation we set in fiscal '21 and accelerating our pace for the next leg of the race. We have a clear vision for our brand's long-term future and we are focused on what it will take to get there. 
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Well, as we've talked about throughout this year, we have continued to see the way that we have gotten closer to the consumer, creating deeper connections.

Well, as we've talked about throughout this year, we have continued to see the way that we have gotten closer to the consumer, creating deeper connections. And as we look at how our brand is positioned around the world, we continue to be very optimistic with what we see. That's translated into very strong retail sales growth throughout the year. And in many circumstances, we've seen demand outstripping supply. 
As we think about the future, especially as we exit '21 and we move forward to '22, there are definitely specific things that give us optimism and confidence. John just mentioned one of them, which is the return to sport, and we're already starting to see an acceleration in our Sport Performance business. We are excited about the connections that we're driving from a digital perspective, especially as physical retail reopens. We believe that is a sticky shift that will continue and that's embedded in our guidance for '22 and also the longer-term outlook that I provided for you. And that shift of a 20-point mix shift in direct is definitely an inflection from a revenue -- it creates an inflection from a revenue perspective. 
And then lastly, I would say that we continue to talk about the significant opportunities that we see more broadly in the marketplace. And while we've had momentum, and we continue to see those dimensions of business outstrip the growth of the rest of the business, the opportunity is still significant relative to our share in those specific areas. And so what I'm referring to there is our Women's business and the opportunity we see in front of us. The apparel business and the opportunities that we see there. And then the momentum that we have with the Jordan Brand, in particular, and the opportunities that we see for that brand, both in North America, but in international markets as well."

So we've got a -- there's a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital. And that's been happening, but the pandemic has simply accelerated that. And that provides the opportunity for us to have a direct connection with consumers, which is increasingly important in a digital world where consumers, while they're going more digital, are focusing on fewer and fewer apps. 
And we are going to be one of the very few apps that have a direct connection with consumers. And that's unlocking great growth. That's unlocking growth in our ability to serve them with more personalized shopping experiences with recommendations across our vast product portfolio with services and other ways to engage them like NIKE Run Club, NIKE Training Club. So we think we're one of the very few in our industry that we'll be able to establish that direct connection with consumers, both around commerce, but also engage them on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. 
And then that produces great consumer insight, and that consumer insight has a bit of a virtuous cycle. The more you have it, the more you can use it. You can use that consumer insight, as I said earlier on, personalizing a recommendation or anticipating a need on replenishing a product when you know they're going to need it. It also drives efficiency in our operations, right? We talk about building a digital supply chain. What that's all about is having the intelligence to know, having the right product in the right place, at the right time, so that we can deliver that product in a low-cost convenient and speedy and climate friendly way. 
And last but not least, that insight consumer insight helps fuel product creation. I mean -- the more we know about our consumers, the more we can build the kind of compelling product that they want and need. And so we feel like, as Matt said, there's a virtuous cycle by embracing our digital transformation as aggressive as we are. 
We think we can create competitive separation. And so -- and we still -- we think it's going to be a  journey that has continuous improvement and continuous ROI and benefits along the way."

And I would just add that the NIKE App or our app ecosystem continues to have a significant impact, and we are continuing to invest in the consumer experience in order to take advantage of the consumers' interest and appetite in engaging with our bra",375,"Yes. And I would just add that the NIKE App or our app ecosystem continues to have a significant impact, and we are continuing to invest in the consumer experience in order to take advantage of the consumers' interest and appetite in engaging with our brand in that way. The app actually represents about 40% of our digital business at this point in time, and we're planning to launch the NIKE App in 10 more countries in fiscal year '22. 
As I think about the financial model, Matt, as you asked, I sort of answered in my question to Kimberly, which is this shift to digital and that direct sale to the consumer is definitely causing us confidence to inflect our revenue outlook upwards as a first point. 
The second point I would say is that as we've continued to see over the past several quarters, and really, if you sort of look through the pandemic, it's really over the last 3 years as we've been seeing more and more business being done through direct and digital. We've been talking about how that shift in mix has enabled us to drive and increase our gross margin expansion versus historical levels of gross margin expansion. And so that's what's embedded in that high 40s guidance outlook. It's continuing to shift to more direct business. And then within that direct business, we continue to see opportunities like I referenced, leveraging data and analytical capabilities, so digital transformation type capabilities to know where to place our inventory, 
how to fulfill demand closer to the consumer, whether it's through our stores or through our regional service centers, how to think about pricing based on the way inventory is flowing and then continued demand and supply management. And then I guess the last thing I would say is that the way that we framed our SG&A guidance is that we feel confident that as we look at the transformation that's taking place in our business over the next 4 years, that at that level of SG&A investment, which is better than where we were in the pandemic, we can fund the investments that we need to fuel this growth and sustain the opportunity that we have in front of us."

We've been in China for over 40 years. Phil invested significant time and energy in China in the early days. And today, we're the largest sport brand there, and we're a brand of China and for China. 
And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity. Consumers feel a strong deep connection to the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands in China. And it's real. I saw that in my first week air there. Can't wait to get back there, and it's strong. And that's brought to life on streets all over China through the over 7,000 monobrand stores we have in China. So we have a strong consumer franchise in China, and they feel very connected to our brand. And so we're going to continue to invest. We'll continue our long-term investment in China, whether it's through the Express Lane, which allows us to have local product insights, so design and deliver with speed and agility. 
Or we're localizing our tech stack. Matt mentioned, we're opening a new digital technology center in Shenzhen. And we're going to invest for the long term, and we're encouraged by the momentum and we have confidence in the future. It's interesting. We've been the #1 sports brand in Tmall for a decade, and we're still #1 today once we open back up on it. 
Over the last month, we've added 1 million new members on Tmall through the 6/18 shopping holiday. And so we're focusing on what we can control -- We're confident of our momentum and our position, and we'll -- we, as Matt outlined, we feel confident about our long-term growth in China."

And those investments are end-to-end from specific innovation and the way we invest in innovation to the way we're investing in product creation to the way that we're now investing in the marketplace through our NIKE Live concepts.

In fact, it's the fastest-growing part of their portfolio. We just had an operating review a couple of weeks ago and was really striking to see how they're extending that brand into both performance product into new ways to leverage that Converse brand and the product line as well as getting into apparel and going global. And so their digital capabilities are growing to have their own, as you know, in addition to being able to get to them on the NIKE website and get to them on their own website.

Looking at Q4 and the full fiscal year we just concluded, our strong business results proved yet again NIKE's unique competitive advantage. Our relentless focus on our objectives is clear and our strategy is working. We're excited by the momentum we continue to see. 
In Q4, we saw growth of over 95%, which translates to 19% growth for the fiscal year. This full year growth was led by our own digital business, which has now more than doubled versus fiscal '19 prior to the pandemic. I've said before that these are times when strong brands can get stronger. And each quarter, this reality becomes even more clear. Today, we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro complexities while also building the future. 
We saw broad-based growth this quarter led by North America at over 140%. Greater China's currency-neutral growth of 9% was impacted amidst marketplace dynamics with improving trends as we exited the quarter. One of NIKE's strengths is our diverse global portfolio. And through the power of that portfolio, we once again overdelivered on our expectations for the quarter. 
As we look ahead to fiscal '22, the opportunity ahead of us is significant. We remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. The structural tailwinds we've discussed before, including the return to sport and permanent shifts in consumer behavior towards digital and health and wellness continue to create energy for us. And we remain focused on our largest growth drivers, including our women's business, apparel, Jordan and international. NIKE sets the pace through a continuous flow of new innovation, the world's greatest roster of athletes and compelling experiences for consumers that create lifelong relationships with our brand. Our strengths and proven playbook give us the confidence to move even faster to invest at even a more accelerated pace against the opportunities we see ahead. 
As the world's largest athletic footwear and apparel brand, we take seriously our leadership position to promote sport participation and an active lifestyle through inspiration and innovation. Our goal isn't merely to take market share. Our goal is also to grow the entire market. NIKE's growth has been and will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll walk through today: connecting with consumers through compelling brand experiences across Nike, Jordan and Converse; driving product innovation against our greatest growth opportunities; and expanding our digital advantage. 
First, let's discuss how we serve consumers. As sport continues to return, NIKE leads with our unique rich heritage and our deep roster of global superstars and up-and-comers who connect us with consumers everywhere. Euro 2020 started 2 weeks ago with Cristiano Ronaldo becoming the leading scorer in Euro's history. England, France, Portugal and the Netherlands are among the teams with great momentum heading into the tournament's next stage. And we're proud that more goals have been scored thus far, wearing NIKE boots than all other brands combined. On the club side, Chelsea won the Champions League on the men's side and Barcelona was the top team on the women's side. 
In the U.S. The WNBA season is underway with the Seattle Storm in first place, led by Sue Bird and Jewell Loyd. And then the NBA, a captivating playoffs has showcased our unmatched rosters of the game's greatest players across NIKE and Jordan, including KD, LeBron, Luka, Jokic and several who are still in the hunt like Giannis, Chris Paul, Devin Booker and Paul George. 
And earlier this week, I was in Eugene for the U.S. track and field trials and got to see incredible performances from Sha'Carri Richardson, Michael Norman, Ryan Crouser and many others. We remain excited for the power of sport on full display during the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo this summer and in Beijing next year. 
This authentic connection with consumers is also fueled by our belief in redefining how we open access to sports for consumers everywhere. A recent campaign, Play New, launched in May, kicking off our largest ever invitation to Gen Z and marking the ignition point of a month-long rally around finding joy and movement in play. We focus Play New on TikTok and Snapchat to show Gen Z that, in their words, ""Sport is a change accelerator."" And their response has been remarkable. The app's augmented reality lenses featuring yoga, dance and surf led to more than 600 million Gen Z impressions in just the first 2 weeks. 
Earlier, I mentioned our goal to grow the market. Well, by inspiring people to try something for the first time, we vastly expand the community of athletes. And we continue to bring the emotion and power of our brand to life through our digital ecosystem, which is led by the SNKRS App. In Q4, SNKRS grew over 90% in demand and saw a nearly 80% growth in monthly active users. We're now offering this growing audience of high-value members and almost daily flow of compelling content and product launches. For Air Max Day in March, 6 different livestream events gave SNKRS Live its highest viewership ever. So whether it's through SNKRS Live or user-generated style inspiration, SNKRS is the perfect intersection of content, community and commerce. 
Moving to my second point. Our relentless pipeline of innovative products continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our product is fueled by sharp consumer insight supported by marketing data and analytics as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. And through our new operating model, we are bringing more precision to the art of product creation as we blend the heart and science of innovation. 
For Q4, let me touch on 2 great examples of how we're investing in our top growth opportunities, our women's business and Jordan Brand. We're investing and focused across the entire value chain to unlock the vast opportunity we see for women's. For the full year, our women's business drove outsized growth of 22% versus the prior year. And despite the tremendous momentum we're seeing in women's, we know that there's even greater growth ahead as we move even faster with our new organization structure and invest far more resources and serving women end to end. 
For instance, in the marketplace, we continue to provide more compelling retail environment through our NIKE Live format. In fact, this past year, we opened 9 new NIKE Live doors, which offer personalized experiences and services for female consumers. Our investments also mean a larger sharper focus on women's-only insights, services and product innovation. And we're already seeing this work come to life. Consumer insight from our female consumer drove the new Pegasus 38, which kept the best cushioning innovations from this popular franchise while improving and tailoring comfort and fit that she wants. The Peg 38 has sold extremely well, and we continue to be energized by the potential we see in footwear for her. 
For the WNBA's 25th season this year, we created the most comprehensive player, team and fan apparel collection in league history. The new WNBA uniforms were completely reengineered to deliver the exact fit, movement and comfort players said that they want from their jersey and sport. The players love them and consumers have agreed with sales growth well above our expectations. And that heightened demand extended to the larger product assortment, with the WNBA's 25th anniversary tee selling out in 1 day. This is just one example of how we drive energy for women's sport across the marketplace as we remain excited by this enormous opportunity looking forward. 
Next, let's discuss Jordan Brand, whose momentum continues to be driven by its unique blend of heritage and innovation as well as its deep connections to consumers and communities around the globe. In fiscal '21, Jordan Brand grew 31%, propelling the business to nearly $5 billion. This growth was driven by continued energy for Jordan's most coveted icons, including the AJ1 and AJ11 as well as new product dimensions. For example, Jordan's women's business nearly tripled in Q4, fueled by compelling product, such as the Flight Essentials apparel collection. We are also increasingly are excited about our delivery of exclusive access for women through collabs like Aleali May's AJ1, which drove over 40% female buyers, more than 10 points higher than average AJ1 buyer profile. 
In Q4, Jordan also launched Zion Williamson's first signature shoe, the Zion 1, as well as the apparel collection. As the first Gen Z signature shoe in Jordan Brand's history, Zion offers both transcendent athletic possibility as well as a deep personal connection with fans. The strong sell-through of Zion's signature shoe collection demonstrates the continued love for Jordan Brands' roster of athletes all over the world.
Quickly looking to the summer in Tokyo. In the next few weeks, we'll be officially launching more of our Olympic product, including our U.S.A. women's basketball and football uniforms, our 4 Skateboarding Federation Kits and a new Medal Stand shoe featuring our hands-free FlyEase technology. We're excited by the strong reaction we've seen for our Olympic product thus far. And we're also thrilled to see our innovation continue to separate us. In running, this includes our Vaporfly Next% 2 for distance runners as well as our best-in-class track spikes. As you've probably heard, our spikes are creating dominant performances at the U.S. track and field trials not just for NIKE athletes but competitor athletes as well. From performance to the Medal Stand to sustainability, we're excited for the world stage this summer in Tokyo to put a global spotlight on our advantage and innovation. 
One final observation on innovation. I recently got the chance to see the long-term product plans that our teams are developing against our new consumer construct of women's, men's, kids and Jordan with sharpness against sport performance and sport lifestyle, and I could not be more excited. It's safe to say that we're more confident than ever in our product pipeline as our focus on the consumer of the future drives our relentless innovation engine. And as we start welcoming employees back to work in our new state-of-the-art design and innovation centers, I know that our innovation pace will only quicken as we reinvent what's possible. 
My third and final point is increasing our digital advantage. As I said earlier, our owned digital business has more than doubled over the past 2 years to over $9 billion. And at the center of our digital ecosystem is our suite of apps, which in Q4 reflected over 40% of our owned digital business. This is the result of deeper consumer connections fueled by compelling product and content. 
A key differentiator for us is membership. It has proven to be a compelling driver of repeat engagement and buying across digital and physical retail. In Q4, we continued to see growth in member demand outpace total digital growth, hitting a new record of $3 billion. This member demand growth was underscored by strong results across the consumer funnel, including member engagement, average order value and buying frequency. In this fiscal year, we met the goals we set at our last Investor Day around membership a full year early and now have more than 300 million NIKE members. More importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new member growth, signaling progress on a deeper member-led commerce funnel. 
We're always looking to elevate our unique member proposition whether that means expanding the number of member-exclusive products or creating new and meaningful retail experiences through Member Days, our NIKE-only retail moments. And this engaging membership experience fuels a virtuous cycle, feeding insight to product creation, inventory optimization and more. Knowing and serving our members drives greater competitive separation. 
Today, we're the clear leaders in our industry, and we continue to see digital as our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22. The combination of owned and partner digital revenue is now nearly 35% of our total business, more than 3 years ahead of our prior plan. And we see no sign of this shift slowing. In fact, we believe we will achieve 50% digital mix of business across owned and partnered in fiscal '25. 
As part of our overall One Nike Marketplace, we're also actively engaged with our strategic wholesale partners who share our vision. Today, we're working closely with large strategic partners like DICK's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and JD Sports as well as compelling local neighborhood partners who are authentic to sport performance and lifestyle. Together, we are driving change to create a new, more connected and seamless experience for consumers around the world, which is exactly what consumers want. It's a shift that speaks to our belief that the strong gets stronger. We're supercharging how we serve consumers with convenience, innovation, content and services. This is how we stay ahead of the pack and expand our lead. 
Finally, as we end our fiscal year, I want to thank our global NIKE teammates. We've all been through a lot this past year. And at NIKE, that's included store closures, supply chain challenges, a digital transformation, a new accelerated strategy and more. And throughout it all, our team has delivered for our consumers and communities. So I just want to take a moment as I close to recognize and personally thank our 75,000 NIKE teammates. You've demonstrated creativity, teamwork and resilience, and you are the reason NIKE leads. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, the people of NIKE are our greatest competitive advantage. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt."

Before I begin my prepared remarks, I too want to take a moment to thank our incredible team. They've delivered extraordinary results over the past year. I also want to take a moment and recognize Andy Muir. This will be her last earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations after recently becoming CFO of our Jordan Brand. Thank you, Andy, for your leadership and specifically for your support in my transition to CFO last year. I wish you the best of luck in your new role. I know you'll do great. And backfilling Andy in this role is Paul Trussell, who many of you already know. Paul joins us from Deutsche Bank, and we're excited to welcome him to the NIKE team. 
Now I'd like to begin today's call with a baseline on where we are in our recovery. Just as we anticipated, NIKE is emerging from the pandemic stronger and better positioned to serve the consumer. And the reason for this is clear, NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling a deeper consumer connection with our brands and driving business results, all while highlighting greater strategic and financial opportunity ahead. 
Over the past 15 months, we have navigated through this challenging environment with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head-on, focused on what we could control, all while keeping the consumer at the center. These actions have helped set a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability, with business performance now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. 
In the fourth quarter, we delivered over $12 billion of reported revenue, our largest quarter ever. Our NIKE Direct business is now approaching 40% of total NIKE Brand revenue. NIKE Digital represents 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, a milestone we've reached several years ahead of our prior plan. And finally, our fiscal '21 EBIT margin reached 15.5%, reflecting more than 300 basis points of expansion when compared to fiscal '19. These metrics now become the new baseline from which we expect to grow. 
As we recover from the global pandemic, it is clear that our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming NIKE's financial model. So later on the call, I will share our financial outlook through fiscal year '25, reflecting a more direct, member-centric business model. However, first, I would like to provide additional detail on our extraordinary fourth quarter results and operating segment performance. 
NIKE, Inc.'s revenue increased 96% and 88% on a currency-neutral basis. This was driven by strong wholesale shipments and NIKE owned store performance as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures. Even as physical retail reopened, we continued to see strong growth in NIKE Digital of 37% versus the prior year. 
Gross margin increased 850 basis points versus the prior year driven by favorable NIKE Direct margins and the anniversary of higher costs, including actions taken to manage supply and demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
SG&A grew 17% versus the prior year due to higher levels of brand activity connected to return of sport, digital marketing to drive digital demand, technology investments to support our digital transformation and higher wage-related expenses. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6% compared to 1.7% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items in the prior year and a shift in earnings mix, primarily related to pandemic recovery. 
Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.93 and full year diluted earnings per share was $3.56, up 123% versus the prior year. 
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 141%. This also marked the first-ever $5 billion quarter for North America driven by notable improvement in full price sell-through as the marketplace reopened and sport activity returned. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong. And as we expected, delayed revenue from the global supply chain disruption in the third quarter was recaptured during the fourth quarter. 
NIKE Direct grew over 120% as NIKE owned stores returned to positive sales growth versus pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, NIKE Digital grew over 50%, while physical traffic continued to improve across the marketplace. NIKE Direct performance was propelled by our members across both digital and physical retail. Member demand nearly doubled versus the prior year, and the number of buying members grew roughly 80%. 
Across the total marketplace, we continue to see retail sales growth and consumer demand for our brands exceeding marketplace supply with marketplace inventory down double digits versus the prior year. NIKE owned inventory declined 7% with double-digit declines in closeout inventory. In-transit full price inventory remains elevated as we continue to experience longer end-to-end lead times for supply. We expect supply chain delays and higher logistics costs to persist throughout much of fiscal '22. 
In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 107% on a currency-neutral basis with strong growth across the region, including the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany and Italy. NIKE Direct grew 57% despite government restrictions requiring nearly half of our NIKE owned stores to remain closed for the first 2 months of the quarter. In May, as restrictions eased, we saw a strong consumer response with incredible pent-up demand, and this momentum has continued into June. NIKE Digital grew nearly 30% versus the prior year. Through our member days, we saw strong engagement with member demand outpacing total NIKE Direct revenue growth with all-time highs for female active members during Air Max week. In the fourth quarter, we also expanded the NIKE mobile app to more than 10 new countries across the region. 
During our last earnings call, I shared our expectation that inventory in EMEA would normalize in the first quarter of fiscal '22. We have exceeded that goal due to stronger-than-anticipated consumer demand, ending fiscal '21 in a healthy and normalized inventory position. 
In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, Greater China delivered its seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth, demonstrating our consistent brand strength and commitment to serving the consumer. NIKE Direct grew 2% in Q4, with strong growth in NIKE owned stores, partially offset by declines in NIKE Digital. 
As John mentioned earlier, Q4 business results were impacted by marketplace dynamics. After a strong March, our business in Greater China was impacted in April, and we adjusted our operations by suspending marketing activities and product launches. We then began to see a recovery trend, improving to a single-digit decline in May and sequentially improving into June, with month-to-date retail sales trends approaching prior year levels. And for the 6/18 consumer moment, our flagship store on Tmall ranked #1, driving the highest demand across the sports industry. 
Building on our 40-year history in Greater China, we continue to invest in serving consumers with the best products Nike has to offer in locally relevant ways. We also continue to invest in the creation of a premium, seamless consumer digital experience and supply chain capabilities. And we plan to open a new digital technology center in Shenzhen to better serve Chinese consumers. 
We have an experienced local team in Greater China who helped create our operational playbook at the beginning of the pandemic. They have proactively managed marketplace supply and demand in order to navigate through these dynamics, and we expect inventory to be normalized by the end of Q2. 
Now moving to APLA. Q4 revenue grew 76% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all territories led by Japan, SOCO and Mexico. And Korea grew double digits this quarter on top of the 8% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter of last year. NIKE Digital grew more than 50%, enabled and amplified by our membership offense. This was highlighted by member days, which drove all-time highs for member demand. This momentum also extended to our marketplace partners in APLA as they return to growth versus pre-pandemic levels and achieved their highest level of full price realization since the beginning of the pandemic. 
During Golden Week in Japan, the Express Lane assortment was heavily influenced by member insights and delivered a sell-through rate that was 2x the rate of the rest of NIKE Digital in Japan, showcasing the power of blending art and science that John referenced earlier. APLA was the last geography to launch our Express Lane offense, and we see significant opportunity to leverage these capabilities to drive deeper, authentic consumer connections across the region. 
Now as we look ahead to fiscal '22 and beyond, I want to provide a new financial outlook through fiscal '25. As we emerge from the pandemic, accelerate our consumer direct strategy and transform the operating model of the company. 
First of all, NIKE is a growth company, and we expect to sustain strong revenue growth going forward. This is based on the significant market opportunity that we see for our brands across the portfolio as well as our accelerated shift to a more direct member-centric business model. As a result, we expect revenue growth to inflect upwards to a range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth on average with outsized marketplace opportunities in women's, apparel, Jordan, digital and international. 
Growth will be led by NIKE Direct and our strategic marketplace partners. Earlier, I mentioned NIKE Direct is approaching 40% of our brand business today, and we expect it to represent approximately 60% of the business in fiscal '25, led by growth in digital. And as John said earlier, we expect owned and partnered digital to achieve 50% business mix in fiscal '25 with NIKE owned digital to represent 40% of the business. 
We will continue reshaping our wholesale business portfolio, which includes divesting from undifferentiated retail while investing in our strategic wholesale partners for healthy growth. Overall, we expect wholesale revenue to remain roughly flat versus fiscal '21. We will support partners who continue to authenticate our brand as well as those who have the scale to create a consistent, premium, digitally connected experience for consumers across the marketplace. 
Our longer-term revenue outlook reflects higher growth expectations across several operating segments. We will continue to leverage the power of our diverse global portfolio. And we expect, on average, North America to grow mid-single to high single digits, EMEA to grow high single digits and APLA to grow low double digits. And with respect to Greater China, while marketplace dynamics still exist, we are optimistic that we can continue to grow low to mid-teens over the long term. We remain committed to investing in the local consumer experience and inspiring the next generation of athletes in China. We will continue to serve consumers with NIKE's performance innovation and sports style product franchises, while also increasing local customization of style and fit for consumers. 
For several quarters now, I've highlighted that the strategic and financial benefit of shifting to a higher mix of business through NIKE Direct led by digital and leveraging enhanced data and analytics capabilities to optimize inventory, drive higher full price realization and lower digital fulfillment costs. 
We now see gross margin rate reaching the high 40s by fiscal '25. We will continue to reallocate resources and invest to enable our digital transformation and fuel the long-term growth and profitability opportunities that we see. Having said that, we expect to invest in SG&A at a rate that drives leverage versus pre-pandemic levels, which averaged roughly 32% to 33% of revenue. As a result of all of these, we see our EBIT margin reaching high teens by fiscal '25 with earnings per share growth of mid- to high teens on average over this period. 
As we drive towards a more direct business model, we remain committed to create long-term value for our shareholders through serving consumers and sustaining our disciplined financial management. We expect to deliver strong growth in free cash flow, maintain annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of revenue, drive returns on invested capital above prior guidance of the low 30% range and deliver consistent returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Now that I've discussed our updated financial outlook through fiscal '25, I will provide guidance for fiscal '22. As I've already said, we entered the fiscal year strong, confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue despite being in a dynamic operating environment. Our confidence is rooted in the fact that consumers in key cities rate NIKE as their favorite brand, that retail sales continue to grow strongly on lean marketplace inventory and our organization is aligned against our new consumer construct, which will help us accelerate even faster against our largest growth opportunities. 
In fiscal '22, we expect revenue to grow low double digits and surpass $50 billion, reflecting strong consumer demand across our operating segments as we lead with digital, scale NIKE owned physical retail concepts and grow with our strategic partners. It's important to note, as we normalize our post-pandemic business and continue to reshape the marketplace, we do not expect quarter-by-quarter growth to be linear. Therefore, we expect first half growth to be slightly higher than second half growth. 
We expect gross margin to expand 125 to 150 basis points, reflecting our continued shift to a more profitable NIKE Direct business and sustained strong full price realization, partially offset by higher product costs, supply chain investments and the annualization of certain onetime benefits in fiscal '21. 
Foreign exchange is estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 70 basis points. We expect SG&A growth to slightly outpace revenue growth as we normalize spend with return to sport and more consistent store operating schedules as well as investments focused against our largest growth opportunities, which I have shared previously. However, we do expect leverage relative to pre-pandemic rates of investment. And last, we expect the fiscal '22 effective tax rate to be mid-teens. 
As we begin our next fiscal year, NIKE continues to navigate through a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. At the same time, we are on the offense and accelerating our strategy to serve more consumers personally and at scale. Our unmatched innovation continues to enable world-class athletes to reach new levels of performance as sport returns to the main stage. Our product pipeline is strong, and we are even more deeply connected to consumers than before the pandemic. 
We are building upon the strong foundation we set in fiscal '21 and accelerating our pace for the next leg of the race. We have a clear vision for our brand's long-term future and we are focused on what it will take to get there. 
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Well, as we've talked about throughout this year, we have continued to see the way that we have gotten closer to the consumer, creating deeper connections. And as we look at how our brand is positioned around the world, we continue to be very optimistic with what we see. That's translated into very strong retail sales growth throughout the year. And in many circumstances, we've seen demand outstripping supply. 
As we think about the future, especially as we exit '21 and we move forward to '22, there are definitely specific things that give us optimism and confidence. John just mentioned one of them, which is the return to sport, and we're already starting to see an acceleration in our sport performance business. We are excited about the connections that we're driving from a digital perspective, especially as physical retail reopens. We believe that is a sticky shift that will continue, and that's embedded in our guidance for '22 and also the longer-term outlook that I provided for you. And that shift of -- a 20-point mix shift in direct is definitely an inflection from a revenue -- it creates an inflection from a revenue perspective. 
And then lastly, I would say that we continue to talk about the significant opportunities that we see more broadly in the marketplace. And while we've had momentum, and we continue to see those dimensions of business outstrip the growth of the rest of the business, the opportunity is still significant relative to our share in those specific areas. And so what I'm referring to there is our women's business and the opportunity we see in front of us, the apparel business and the opportunities that we see there and then the momentum that we have with the Jordan Brand, in particular, and the opportunities that we see for that brand both in North America but in international markets as well."

So we've got a -- there's a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital. And that's been happening, but the pandemic has simply accelerated that. And that provides the opportunity for us to have a direct connection with consumers, which is increasingly important in a digital world where consumers, while they're going more digital, are focusing on fewer and fewer apps. And we are going to be one of the very few apps that have a direct connection with consumers. 
And that's unlocking great growth. That's unlocking growth in our ability to serve them with more personalized shopping experiences, with recommendations across our vast product portfolio, with services and other ways to engage them like NIKE Run Club, NIKE Training Club. So we think we're one of the very few in our industry that will be able to establish that direct connection with consumers both around commerce but also engage them on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. 
And then that produces great consumer insight. And that consumer insight has a bit of a virtuous cycle. The more you have it, the more you can use it. You can use that consumer insight, as I said earlier on, personalizing a recommendation or anticipating a need on replenishing a product when you know they're going to need it. It also drives efficiency in our operations, right? We talk about building a digital supply chain. What that's all about is having the intelligence to know, having the right product in the right place at the right time, so that we can deliver that product in a low-cost, convenient and speedy and in a climate-friendly way. 
And last, but not least, that insight -- consumer insight helps fuel product creation. I mean the more we know about our consumers, the more we can build the kind of compelling product that they want and need. And so we feel like -- as Matt said, there's a virtuous cycle by embracing our digital transformation as aggressive as we are. We think we can create competitive separation. And so -- and we still -- we think it's going to be a journey that has continuous improvement and continuous ROI and benefits along the way."

And I would just add that the NIKE App or our app ecosystem continues to have a significant impact, and we are continuing to invest in the consumer experience in order to take advantage of the consumers' interest and appetite in engaging with our bra",374,"Yes. And I would just add that the NIKE App or our app ecosystem continues to have a significant impact, and we are continuing to invest in the consumer experience in order to take advantage of the consumers' interest and appetite in engaging with our brand in that way. The app actually represents about 40% of our digital business at this point in time, and we're planning to launch the NIKE App in 10 more countries in fiscal year '22. 
As I think about the financial model, Matt, as you asked, I sort of answered in my question to Kimberly, which is this shift to digital and that direct sale to the consumer is definitely causing us confidence to inflect our revenue outlook upwards as a first point. 
The second point I would say is that as we've continued to see over the past several quarters and really, if you sort of look through the pandemic, it's really over the last 3 years as we've been seeing more and more business being done through direct and digital, we've been talking about how that shift in mix has enabled us to drive and increase our gross margin expansion versus historical levels of gross margin expansion. And so that's what's embedded in that high 40s guidance outlook. It's continuing to shift to more direct business. And then within that direct business, we continue to see opportunities like I referenced, leveraging data and analytical capabilities, so digital transformation-type capabilities to know where to place our inventory, how to fulfill demand closer to the consumer, whether it's through our stores or through our regional service centers, how to think about pricing based on the way inventory is flowing and then continued demand and supply management. 
And then I guess the last thing I would say is that the way that we framed our SG&A guidance is that we feel confident that as we look at the transformation that's taking place in our business over the next 4 years that at that level of SG&A investment, which is better than where we were in the pandemic, we can fund the investments that we need to fuel this growth and sustain the opportunity that we have in front of us."

And today, we're the largest sport brand there, and we're a brand of China and for China. 
And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity. Consumers feel a strong, deep connection to the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands in China. And it's real. I saw that in my first week here. Can't wait to get back there. And it's strong. And that's brought to life on streets all over China through the over 7,000 mono-brand stores we have in China. So we have a strong consumer franchise in China, and they feel very connected to our brand. 
And so we're going to continue to invest. We'll continue our long-term investment in China whether it's through the Express Lane, which allows us to have local product insights, so design and deliver with speed and agility or we're localizing our tech stack. Matt mentioned we're opening a new digital technology center in Shenzhen. And we're going to invest for the long term, and we're encouraged by the momentum and we have confidence in the future.

And those investments are end-to-end, from specific innovation and the way we invest in innovation to the way we're investing in product creation, to the way that we're now investing in the marketplace through our NIKE Live concepts.

We just had an operating review a couple of weeks ago and was really striking to see how they're extending that brand into both performance product into new ways to leverage that Converse brand and the product line as well as getting into apparel and going global.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport. And as we saw again in Q1, our strategy is working with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation, commitment to purpose and proven operational playbook, we stay at the front of the pack. 
Q1 was another strong quarter for NIKE, with revenue growth of 16%. And even as we saw physical retail traffic return across much of the portfolio, Digital continued its momentum with 25% currency-neutral growth, led by North America at over 40. Our digital success is evident of the product innovation, brand strength and scale that drives our meaningful relationships with consumers as we continue to show momentum against our biggest growth priorities. 
As has been the case since the start of pandemic, I'm proud of the way our entire NIKE Inc. team has delivered through macro volatility. Over the past 18 months, we've demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulence to emerge even stronger and better positioned. And that's what we'll continue to do as we navigate through these current supply chain issues. We'll focus on what we can control while leveraging the many levers at our disposal. You'll hear Matt walk through our mitigation efforts in a few minutes. 
Today, we're in a stronger position relative to our competition than we were prior to the pandemic. Why? Because the changes happening in the market work in our favor. Consumers' shift to digital that might have taken 5 years will now only take 2. That plays to NIKE's advantage. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is capitalizing on this marketplace transformation. We know that when we get to the other side of this, we'll be in even stronger shape. We'll be more agile, more direct and more digital. 
So we remain focused and confident in our long-term business outlook. Our competitive advantages, including our innovative product, brand strength fueled by compelling storytelling, our roster of the world's best athletes and increasingly, our industry-leading digital experiences at retail will continue to create separation. As we drive strong, sustained consumer demand, our confidence remains undiminished. 
We've just wrapped up an incredible summer of sport, highlighted, of course, by the Olympics and Paralympics. And moments like these are exciting for our company because sport energizes our roughly 75,000 employees around the world. You can just feel it. And it's through that passion for sport that we continue to innovate and connect to the consumer. 
And this summer in Tokyo, our leadership as the world's most innovative sports brand was demonstrated once again. If NIKE were a country, we would have eclipsed the competition, capturing 226 medals, including 85 golds. 
Here are a few examples of what excited us most this summer. We saw the emergence of Gen Z as a powerful next generation of athletes led by a pair of 13-year-old skateboarders who showed us the joy in the expansion of the definition of sport. We shined in key team sports, including football, where NIKE teams took home gold in both men's and women's and basketball, where NIKE and Jordan teams combined to take 5 of the 6 medals, including both golds. And we continued our great legacy in track and field with NIKE athletes winning more individual medals in track and field events than all other brands combined. 
And at the same time, the European Championships brought incredible energy to football in Q1 with England making it to the final. Our brand anthem, The Land of New Footfall, brought a fresh approach to the sport, representing NIKE's vision that in this game, everyone is welcome. The film saw more than 800 million impressions across all channels, as more than half of EMEA's Gen Z population viewed it at least once. 
And the summer sport also saw Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA title after an electrifying finals against Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Days later, we released Giannis' latest signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 3, which is built to support the dominant physicality that defines his style of play. We continue to see strong response to the Zoom Freak, and we're excited by what we're seeing with our growing Giannis business. 
And speaking of Devin Booker, Q1 was a great reminder of how we're investing in the next generation of superstars as we continue to build our roster of athletes. Jordan Brand signed the NFL Dak Prescott in the quarter, joining emerging global icons in NIKE Inc.'s family, including U.S. Open Winner, Emma Raducanu and Manchester United's Jadon Sancho. 
At the end of the quarter, the summer sport gave way to back-to-school season. So far this fall, we've seen sell-through in our kids business up almost 30%, led by digital with growth of almost 70. As we focus on the kids opportunity, our new consumer construct through that, we are connecting with families more authentically than ever before. We're creating kid-specific designs and leveraging new channels for us to connect with these consumers. Take for example, Playlist, which is a just-for-kids series on nike.com and YouTube. It's filled with games, challenges and exclusive athlete content, all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement in play. Its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring LeBron James and some of his costars from their movie Space Jam: A New Legacy Playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations. 
And our kids business remains an important connection point for us, an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long term. We're the largest kids athletic footwear brand in the world, but we know that there is still so much potential ahead. 
And as I've said before, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. Our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage. And this week, I toured our new LeBron James Innovation Center here at our world headquarters with LeBron. At over 750,000 square feet, this new home for our innovation teams is 5x the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of NIKE's leadership in sports science. We expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further. 
And looking at our innovation agenda, the 2 areas that I'd like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition: Apparel and sustainability. 
First, let's take a look at apparel. We're seeing strong over-indexing growth of 16% in this key growth driver. And the investments we're making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher apparel growth for women's led by our yoga business. Our yoga collection today features multiple industry-leading innovations, including Dri-FIT and Infinalon. These innovations are resonating with consumers and have helped us nearly quadruple our yoga business over the past 2 years. 
Another key apparel story for us in Q1 was our bras business. This quarter, we maintained our #1 market share in sports bras in North America and introduced the NIKE Dri-FIT ADB Swoosh bra. Dri-FIT ADB combines the ultimate and cooling fabrics with highly engineered methods to make. It's an innovation that's connected with consumers as we scale this technology across our line. 
And now to take a look at sustainability. Look at what we've done with Space Hippie. Space Hippie, as you may recall, is quite literally made from trash, and it was originally introduced at our 2020 Future Forum and debuted 4 separate sustainable material innovations for us, including creator foam and space waste yarn. Now since then, we have strategically grown this franchise to global scale. And what's more, we've also scaled these individual material innovations across our entire portfolio. So today, 1 year after that initial launch, there are more than 43 styles using Space Hippie innovations across 4 sports, 3 brands and our full consumer construct. For instance, you can see it come to life in iconic franchises such as the Air Force 1 greater; new performance innovation platforms like COSMIC Unity; and even in our hands-free accessibility line with styles like Glide Fly. By driving new dimensions across platforms, our work to scale Space Hippie innovations catalyze growth. Consumers are clearly responding to sustainability as we're seeing very strong full price sell-through for this family of product with vast opportunity to drive continued consumer and business value still ahead. 
And this is just 1 example of how we lead with platforms and not just products. Our deliberate franchise and innovation management create scalable and sustainable impacts on our business, and I'm excited by the upcoming new innovation platforms, we'll be introducing soon. 
Next, let's discuss NIKE's increasing digital advantage. We continue to lead the industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that deepens relationships between consumers and our brands. Our advantage comes to life at retail in both digital as well as at the intersection of digital and physical. I'll discuss both here. 
Even as physical retail revenue approach pre-pandemic levels, our Digital business this quarter grew double digits. This is the result of an unwavering focus on our strategy and the investments we've made against our end-to-end digital transformation. And so we continue to expect Digital to be our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22. 
Now one of the best gauges for success in our Digital business is how strongly we're connecting with members. Our Digital growth is led by outsized member buying, which has seen a penetration increase of 14 points since last year. Our membership strategy is working as we increasingly use data and analytics to personalize member product offering and experiences. And we're seeing this come to life as repeat buying members grew more than 70% in the quarter. 
Now part of our success stems from our constant focus on expanding what it means to be a NIKE member. We brought this to life in Q1 by introducing a new launch experience exclusive to the SNKRS app that revolutionizes how we serve consumers. The new experience debuted in one of the year's most highly anticipated launches, the Off-White Dunk. For the launch last month, we rolled out our new elevated SNKRS exclusive access. This approach sends personalized purchase offers to members based on their engagement with SNKRS, past purchase attempts and other criteria using data science to drive digital member targeting. For example, 90% of the invitees for the Off-White Dunk went to members who had lost out on a prior Off-White collaboration over the past 2 years. The result, the Off-White Dunk end up in the hands of hundreds of thousands of our most deserving members, creating what we call exclusivity at scale. And this improved consumer experience has a positive impact on the entire business. We've seen that those who benefit from exclusive access on SNKRS spend more across NIKE, fueled by the energy of their win. So our increasingly personalized approach to launch, along with benefits like member days and exclusive NIKE By You access, highlights how we continue to increase the value proposition of NIKE membership. 
We're also leveraging our digital advantage by investing in our brick-and-mortar fleet to create a compelling retail footprint that supercharges how we serve consumers across physical and digital. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Los Angeles and toured some of our great retail there. I got to see a wide variety of stores, including our NIKE Live door in Long Beach, a community door in East L.A. and more. And across each and every store, what jumped out to me was our team. They're love for their community and their passion for our product and bringing it to life for consumers was inspiring and just awesome to see. I also enjoyed visiting a few strategic partner doors, including DICK's and Foot Locker. What's clear across the marketplace, both owned and partnered, is how online to offline is becoming second nature. We know that higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are driving better consumer experience and loyalty. 
O2O services, such as buy online, pick up in store and ship from store as well as the in-store shopping features of the NIKE app, drive our premium and seamless consumer experience. And we're starting to extend these innovative experiences globally. In Q1, we brought our NIKE Rise, an immersive concept to Sole. NIKE Sole introduces new features to Live -- or Rise, rather, including Inside Track, an interactive RFID-enabled digital footwear table where shoppers can compare details for any 2 shoes simply by placing them on the table. Our digitally connected retail experiences are clearly resonating with consumers. This quarter, our in-line fleet grew over 70% in revenue, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We're seeing over-index growth from members, not just at digital but also at physical retail, with member-buying penetration up double digits since last year. And so we'll continue expanding these compelling experiences across our fleet in fiscal '22, driving that interplay between physical and digital retail. 
In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do, staying on the offense. The strength of our consumer demand around the world continues to give us confidence in our playbook and execution. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I am proud of our resilient and creative team across NIKE, Jordan and Converse, and the work we continue to deliver for consumers. Our confidence as we look long term has not changed one bit. We've already gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we're going to emerge from it even stronger yet. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

NIKE's acceleration to a more direct member-centric business model continues to fuel deep connections between consumers and our portfolio of brands. Drawing upon our culture of innovation, unmatched global scale and our industry-leading digital platform, we continue to serve the modern consumer as only NIKE can. 
Our first quarter results proved again that our strategy is working. And NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling the transformation of our long-term financial model. Our relentless focus on serving the consumer translated into revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% versus the prior year. 
The NIKE Brand remains distinctive and deeply connected in our key cities around the world. From New York to Paris, Shanghai to Tokyo, NIKE continues to be consumers' #1 cool and favorite brand with a position that has gained strength as we've navigated through the pandemic. 
Consumer demand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly high, and our first quarter financial results would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain congestion, resulting in lack of available supply. Despite these headwinds, retail sales still grew double digits versus the prior year, including a record-setting back-to-school season in North America. SNKRS has increasingly become an indicator and barometer of brand heat now being operational at scale in 50 countries around the world. 
NIKE Digital is now 21% of total NIKE brand revenue, which is an increase of 2 points versus last year with strong double-digit growth versus the prior year, even with broad reopening of physical retail. Digital is increasingly becoming a part of everyone's shopping journey, and we are well positioned to reach our vision of a 40% owned digital business by fiscal '25. 
And coming back to Marketplace Health for a moment, we delivered strong growth in average selling price this quarter with continued improvement in full price realization. This performance reflects our intentional efforts to manage the health of our product franchises as demand surges, to move available inventory to serve demand in the right channels and to drive a more premium experience for consumers. This quarter, we exceeded our 65% full price sales realization goal, which reflects the expectations that we put forward at our last Investor Day. 
As we accelerate our consumer-led digital transformation, we are developing and refining new capabilities that are transforming our operating model, quickly becoming a competitive advantage for NIKE. Central to these capabilities is scaling our digital-first supply chain to enable NIKE's digital growth while optimizing service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We are evolving our distribution network and forward deploying inventory closer to the consumer, leveraging data and advanced analytics. These actions will improve service levels, reduce carbon impact and ultimately reduce cost to fulfill an order. Our regional service center outside of Los Angeles opened 1 year ago, and we're excited with the opening of 2 more centers in Q1, 1 in the East Coast and 1 in Spain. 
Our investments in O2O services are putting our products in the path of more consumers and more efficiently optimizing our inventory. Today, we have at least 2 O2O services in each of our NIKE-owned stores in the U.S., and we are aggressively scaling these services across the globe. 
Our Express Lane offense is also creating more and more agility across our portfolio. From creating locally relevant product on shorter lead times, to leveraging a shared inventory pool across the marketplace, we are better conserving consumers with more operational flexibility, yielding higher profitability. This quarter, Express Lane grew roughly 20% versus the prior year and increased its share of overall business. 
And last, the NIKE app continues to enable a convergence between physical and digital shopping journeys, eliminating friction for consumers. From member-driven personalization and localization to building an endless aisle through digital integration with our most important wholesale partners, Consumer Direct Acceleration is transforming NIKE's operating model to move at the speed of the consumer. 
Now let me turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 16% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all marketplace channels. NIKE Digital grew 25% and NIKE-owned stores grew 24%. Wholesale grew 5% in the quarter, negatively impacted by lower available inventory supply due to worsening transit times. Gross margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins and partially offset by increased ocean freight surcharges. 
SG&A grew 20% versus the prior year. This was due to higher wage-related expenses, higher levels of brand activity connected to return to sport and strategic technology investments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11% compared to 11.5% for the same period last year. This was due to increased benefits from stock-based compensation and discrete items, offset by a shift in our earnings mix. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up 22% versus the prior year. 
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 15% and EBIT grew 10%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong for the fifth consecutive season, energized this quarter by back-to-school and the return to sport. Retail sales for our Performance business grew strong double digits during the fall season, led by running, fitness and basketball, powered by excitement from the Olympics, the new WNBA season and the NBA finals. NIKE Direct grew more than 45%, with NIKE Digital now representing 26% share of business. Digital continued its momentum and grew more than 40%, increasing market share by outperforming industry trends with strong growth in traffic and repeat buying member activity. The return to physical retail accelerated NIKE-owned store growth of over 50% as we serve members with elevated experiences. NIKE-owned inventory increased 12% versus the prior year. This was driven by highly elevated in-transit inventory levels as transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels. This impacted product availability across the marketplace and our ability to serve strong levels of consumer demand, particularly in the wholesale channels. Closeout inventory was down double digits versus the prior year. 
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 26% on a reported basis. This region was energized by the Euros this summer, where NIKE players scored more goals than all other brands combined, and more than half of those goals were with our material boots. We saw a strong consumer response to both the material booth and replica jerseys during the tournament. NIKE Direct grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by our NIKE-owned stores. Following a full reopening, we saw traffic increase by double digits versus the prior year with better-than-expected conversion rates. In EMEA, while NIKE Digital grew 2% in the quarter, demand for full-price products grew nearly 30% as we compare to higher liquidation levels in the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 14% on a reported basis with closeout inventory down double digits. Transit times to EMEA have also deteriorated over the past 90 days, causing higher levels of in-transit inventory and negatively impacting product availability to serve strong consumer demand. 
In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis as the team delivered in line with our own recovery expectations. Retail sales were impacted in late July and August due to regional closures and lower levels of foot traffic due to COVID containment. Prior to late July, physical traffic had been approaching prior year levels. 
In July, we engaged with consumers through the launch of our Joy of Sports local marketing campaign. This campaign generated over 1 billion local views, demonstrating strong brand connection with Chinese consumers. NIKE Direct declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis, partially impacted by retail closures. NIKE Digital declined 6% as we compare to higher liquidation in the prior year, partially offset by double-digit improvement in full price sales mix. We experienced a strong 6/18 consumer moment where we grew nearly 10% versus the prior year and remained the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Demand in our SNKRS app grew more than 130% for the quarter. Our experienced local team continues to navigate through marketplace dynamics. We finished the quarter with healthy marketplace weeks of supply, and inventory normalization is on plan. 
Now moving to APLA. First quarter revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 72% on a reported basis. Revenue growth was led by [ Soco ], Japan, Mexico and Korea, with more muted growth in Pacific and Southeast Asia and India due to COVID restrictions and government-mandated store closures. NIKE Digital grew more than 60% on a currency-neutral basis, highlighted by the expansion of our NIKE App. In June, the app went live in Mexico and 6 additional countries across Southeast Asia, generating 3 million local downloads during the quarter. 
Earlier on the call, John spoke about the new NIKE Rise retail experience in Seoul. To mark the opening of the store, our Express Lane, SNKRS and NIKE Rise teams created the NIKE Seoul Dunk. This collaboration drove more than half of day 1 sales and highlight how digital and physical experiences are converging in our own stores, leveraging local insights and a more agile supply model. 
Now I will turn to our financial outlook. Consumer demand for NIKE remains at an all-time high, and we are confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue. However, we are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the manufacture and movement of product around the world. Previously, I had shared that we were planning for transit times to remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated even further in the first quarter, with North America and EMEA seeing increases in transit times due primarily to port and rail congestion and labor shortages. Additionally, several of our factory partners in Vietnam and Indonesia were required to abruptly cease operations in the first quarter. As of today, Indonesia is now fully operational. But in Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate. 
Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time. Therefore, we're revising our short-term financial outlook to incorporate the following factors: 10 weeks of production already lost in Vietnam since mid-July; factory reopening to occur in phases beginning in October with a ramp to full production over several months; and elevated transit times consistent with where we are now operating today. 
We now expect fiscal '22 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth, due solely to the supply chain impacts that I just described. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits versus the prior year as factory closures have impacted production and delivery times for the holiday and spring seasons. Lost weeks of production, combined with longer transit times, will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters. 
We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors. However, those geographies in Asia with less in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter will experience a disproportionate impact beginning in Q2. For the balance of fiscal '22, we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply. We are optimistic inventory supply availability will improve heading into fiscal '23, against the backdrop of a very strong brand and healthy pull market across all geographies. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L. We still expect gross margin to expand 125 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger-than-expected full price realization, the ongoing shift to our more profitable NIKE Direct business and price increases in the second half. This more than offsets roughly 100 basis points of additional transportation, logistics and air freight costs to move inventory in this dynamic environment. We also expect a lower foreign exchange benefit, now estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 60 basis points. And for the second quarter, we expect gross margin to expand at a rate lower than the full year due to higher planned airfreight investment for the holiday season. 
We expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens. We intend to maintain our position as the #1 cool and favorite brand and to celebrate the return to sport as we inspire and engage consumers around the world. We will also maintain pace on our multiyear investment plans in order to transform our business for the future. As I've outlined in prior quarters, NIKE's financial strength is a competitive advantage, and it is in moments like these where our competitive strengths and strong balance sheet affords us the ability to remain focused on what's required to win and serve consumers for the long term. 
In closing, our vision for NIKE's long-term future remains unchanged. NIKE is a growth company with unlimited potential. Despite new short-term operational dynamics, our Consumer Direct Acceleration offense is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model toward the long-term fiscal '25 financial outlook I shared last quarter. This quarter's impressive results are additional proof that our strategy is right, not only for the moment we find ourselves in, but also for the opportunity to serve the future of athletes and sport like only NIKE can. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone, and there is no better team to navigate through volatility and lead long-term transformational change. 
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. As I said",685,"Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. 
As I said earlier, consumer demand has never been higher, and we expect strong demand to continue for quarters to come. Over the last 90 days, 2 things have happened in the industry that we didn't anticipate. First, already long transit times worsened; and second, local governments mandated shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Keep in mind that there are global complexities and differences in transit times and sourcing mix across our geographies, so I'm going to use North America as an example to just go a little deeper on what I'm talking about. 
Prior to the pandemic, it would have taken approximately 40 days to move product from Asia to North America. Transit times have been increasing due to container shortages, port congestion, rail congestion and labor shortages, impacting the entire industry. And during Q1, these lead times worsened further to now sit at 80 days, roughly 2x normal. 
So here's where the geo-specific piece comes in. So as we finished Q1 with higher levels of in-transit inventory, that means that we had full price inventory that was unavailable to use to serve current consumer demand in this quarter. We would have had an even stronger top line result if we had more product available to serve that consumer demand. And so these elevated transit times that we're seeing, we've been talking about them now for several quarters, and they worsened this quarter, continue to have an impact on our business. 
And then in addition to that, there's Vietnam. And it's important to think about these 2 impacts together. As of today, 80% of our footwear factories located in the south and nearly half of our apparel factories in Vietnam are currently closed. So through this week, that means we've already lost 10 weeks of production, and that gap will continue until factories are able to reopen and produce product at normal capacity. So this has created a gap to the flow of inventory originally ordered for delivery beginning in mid-October. And our experience shows us, based on navigating through this pandemic over the last 18 months, and it's going to take several months to ramp back to full production. 
Now on a positive note, a few factories have just had their reopening plans approved, like this week. And so we're optimistic about a phase reopening and ramp of production beginning in October. And as I said in the call, earlier in the call, Indonesia is already operational, and they're ramping back up to capacity. 
So North America is coming into Q2 with elevated and transit inventory, which means North America will have higher quantities of fall season product that it can sell in the second quarter. But holiday and spring production has been delayed. And if you combine that with longer lead times, the impact of the lost production is going to have a greater impact in North America in Q3. 
Conversely, Greater China, which has lower levels of in-transit inventory and shorter transit times because it's closer to the factories, is going to experience the impact of the lost production earlier in Q2. Our teams are leveraging their experience in our operational playbook and taking actions to try to mitigate these impacts. And they're doing things like maximizing our footwear production capacity in other countries, shifting apparel production out of Vietnam to other countries like Indonesia and China and others where viable, strategically leveraging airfreight. And then we're continuing to employ a seasonless approach to product to serve incredibly strong consumer demand, given our success that we've had selling at full price, even if the product reaches the market later than we expected. 
So while the environment is dynamic, these supply chain issues, we believe, are temporary. And from what we can see today, we're optimistic that available inventory supply will be improved as we head into fiscal year '23."

I mean it's -- so I would say traditional sports is what I'll call it, is strong and back. And that's also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. 
Second thing we're seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport, whether that's in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate, right? And as that young generation, Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. 
But also coming out of pandemic, the definition of sport, I think, is getting to every athlete -- asterisk in different ways, just the concept of movements and health. And the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so part of the tailwind we're seeing is sport is becoming part of everyone's everyday life. And that's a powerful tailwind for us. 
And then athleisure, that's blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life, is also what we view as a tailwind. So we're doubling down on traditional sport, on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future."

And we're going to continue to focus on prioritizing our product availability for those locations where the consumer is shopping, and that will continue to be within NIKE Zone channels and our most strategic wholesale partners. And that's what we're going to continue to do to serve that demand. The marketplace, as I said, is going to be lean. We're going to have lean inventory across the marketplace. But NIKE and our partners will continue to try to create the best consumer experience that we can throughout the remainder of that -- of this fiscal year."

The year-over-year comparisons, as we've talked about for a while here, are not really intuitive. And a couple of quarters ago, I talked about, as we were starting to see the strength in consumer connections and the acceleration of our business, that we were going to begin accelerating investment to drive our digital transformation. And in particular, where we were investing was against technology, our digital -- creating a digital-first supply chain and the marketplace. And we created a multiyear investment plan against our outlook to drive that growth. And when we finished the first quarter, we finished our first quarter spending at about 29% of revenue. And as we think about the transitory nature of these impacts, we believe this is a moment where NIKE's financial strength is a real competitive advantage. And so we believe these short-term dynamics will pass, but we're more convinced and committed to what we believe the capabilities we need to operate a consumer direct business at scale as we execute the strategy. And so that's where our focus and attention is going to be. We're going to keep our teams focused on creating those capabilities and which we're seeing translate into strong growth and profitability. And that also includes the investments that we're making from a brand perspective. Strong brands get stronger in this environment. And having that deep consumer connection, especially when it's rooted to sport and the return of sport, is absolutely what we need to be doing in order to continue to stay in a position of strength."

So on the pricing question, we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've taken some pricing actions in the second half. And what I would say, Simeon, is that we evaluate price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And we consider a number of different factors that we incorporate to make a decision about what to do. But what I will tell you is that we take a long -- we have a long-standing relationship with our consumer. And so we take a long-term view to these types of decisions. 
And so the price increases that we've implemented in the second half are in the low single-digit range. And we feel it's appropriate given the marketplace we're operating in and those other factors that I referenced, considering we've got rising input costs and other factors that are impacting our business. But I think it's really important not to drive past the fact that we continue to see strong growth in ASPs across the whole marketplace, driven by higher full price realization as we've been talking about for several quarters and lower markdowns, and leveraging the capabilities of identifying our inventory, knowing where we want to put it, putting it in the path of the consumer, optimizing it between ourselves and our physical locations, our digital locations and increasingly providing that endless access to some of our wholesale, to some of our most strategic wholesale partners. All of these things are contributing to a higher level of full price realization across the marketplace. And so we do believe that this is a base from where we want to operate as opposed to a moment in time, and that's driving profitability for NIKE at a moment that -- where there's lots of disruption. 
I think in terms of your second question in terms of undifferentiated or differentiated. What I would tell you is that we continue to see strong growth in our differentiated partners. And our differentiated partners, because of the fact that they are creating a better consumer experience and driving more demand, their weeks of inventory on hand is about half where they would like for it to be right now because of the strong demand that they're driving. 
And to take it a step further, over the last 3 years, we've actually exited about 50% of our undifferentiated accounts while we've been able to deliver strong double-digit growth. And so we believe that we will continue down this strategy. And as John alluded to in his prepared remarks, we believe that the supply-related reductions will likely trigger an even greater acceleration in the transformation of the marketplace towards NIKE and our most important wholesale partners."

We've lost 10 weeks of production since mid-July. And so what we're really focused on is are our factory partners getting back to full capacity so that we can serve demand that we see in the marketplace. When we combine the lost production and the reramping plus the extended lead times, we feel optimistic that we're going to see inventory supply improving as we exit this fiscal year and move into fiscal year '23.

We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think we're stronger today than we were 18 months ago and we'll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport. And as we saw again in Q1, our strategy is working with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation, commitment to purpose and proven operational playbook, we stay at the front of the pack.
Q1 was another strong quarter for NIKE, with revenue growth of 16%. And even as we saw physical retail traffic return across much of the portfolio, digital continued its momentum with 25% currency-neutral growth, led by North America at over 40. Our digital success is evidence of the product innovation, brand strength and scale that drives our meaningful relationships with consumers as we continue to show momentum against our biggest growth priorities.
As has been the case since the start of pandemic, I'm proud of the way our entire NIKE, Inc. team has delivered through macro volatility. Over the past 18 months, we've demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulence to emerge even stronger and better positioned. And that's what we'll continue to do as we navigate through these current supply chain issues. We'll focus on what we can control while leveraging the many levers at our disposal. You'll hear Matt walk through our mitigation efforts in a few minutes.
Today, we're in a stronger position relative to our competition than we were prior to the pandemic. Why? Because the changes happening in the market work in our favor. Consumers' shift to digital that might have taken 5 years will now only take 2. That plays to NIKE's advantage. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is capitalizing on this marketplace transformation. We know that when we get to the other side of this, we'll be in even stronger shape. We'll be more agile, more direct and more digital.
So we remain focused and confident in our long-term business outlook. Our competitive advantages, including our innovative product, brand strength fueled by compelling storytelling, our roster of the world's best athletes and increasingly, our industry-leading digital experiences at retail will continue to create separation. As we drive strong, sustained consumer demand, our confidence remains undiminished.
We've just wrapped up an incredible summer of sport, highlighted, of course, by the Olympics and Paralympics. And moments like these are exciting for our company because sport energizes our roughly 75,000 employees around the world. You can just feel it. And it's through that passion for sport that we continue to innovate and connect to the consumer.
And this summer in Tokyo, our leadership as the world's most innovative sports brand was demonstrated once again. If NIKE were a country, we would have eclipsed the competition, capturing 226 medals, including 85 golds.
Here are a few examples of what excited us most this summer. We saw the emergence of Gen Z as a powerful next generation of athletes led by a pair of 13-year-old skateboarders who showed us the joy in the expansion of the definition of sport. We shined in key team sports, including football, where Nike teams took home gold in both men's and women's; and basketball, where Nike and Jordan teams combined to take 5 of the 6 medals, including both golds. And we continued our great legacy in track and field with NIKE athletes winning more individual medals in track and field events than all other brands combined.
And at the same time, the European Championships brought incredible energy to football in Q1 with England making it to the final. Our brand anthem, The Land of New Footfall, brought a fresh approach to the sport, representing NIKE's vision that in this game, everyone is welcome. The film saw more than 800 million impressions across all channels as more than half of EMEA's Gen Z population viewed it at least once.
And the summer sport also saw Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA title after an electrifying finals against Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Days later, we released Giannis' latest signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 3, which is built to support the dominant physicality that defines his style of play. We continue to see strong response to the Zoom Freak, and we're excited by what we're seeing with our growing Giannis business.
And speaking of Devin Booker, Q1 was a great reminder of how we're investing in the next generation of superstars as we continue to build our roster of athletes. Jordan Brand signed the NFL's Dak Prescott in the quarter, joining emerging global icons in NIKE, Inc.'s family, including U.S. Open Winner, Emma Raducanu, and Manchester United's Jadon Sancho.
At the end of the quarter, the summer sport gave way to back-to-school season. So far this fall, we've seen sell-through in our kids business up almost 30%, led by digital with growth of almost 70. As we focus on the kids opportunity, our new consumer construct, through that, we are connecting with families more authentically than ever before. We're creating kid-specific designs and leveraging new channels for us to connect with these consumers. 
Take for example Playlist, which is a just-for-kids series on nike.com and YouTube. It's filled with games, challenges and exclusive athlete content, all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement and play. Its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring LeBron James and some of his costars from their movie Space Jam: A New Legacy. Playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations.
And our kids business remains an important connection point for us, an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long term. We're the largest kids athletic footwear brand in the world, but we know that there is still so much potential ahead.
And as I've said before, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. Our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage. And this week, I toured our new LeBron James innovation center here at our world headquarters with LeBron. At over 750,000 square feet, this new home for our innovation teams is 5x the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of NIKE's leadership in sports science. We expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further.
And looking at our innovation agenda, the 2 areas that I'd like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition: apparel and sustainability. First, let's take a look at apparel. We're seeing strong over-indexing growth of 16% in this key growth driver. And the investments we're making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher apparel growth for women's led by our yoga business. Our yoga collection today features multiple industry-leading innovations, including Dri-FIT and Infinalon. These innovations are resonating with consumers and have helped us nearly quadruple our yoga business over the past 2 years.
Another key apparel story for us in Q1 was our bras business. This quarter, we maintained our #1 market share in sports bras in North America and introduced the Nike Dri-FIT ADV Swoosh bra. Dri-FIT ADV combines the ultimate and cooling fabrics with highly engineered methods to make. It's an innovation that's connected with consumers as we scale this technology across our line.
And now to take a look at sustainability, look at what we've done with Space Hippie. Space Hippie, as you may recall, is quite literally made from trash. And it was originally introduced at our 2020 Future Forum and debuted 4 separate sustainable material innovations for us, including crater foam and space waste yarn. Now since then, we have strategically grown this franchise to global scale. And what's more, we've also scaled these individual material innovations across our entire portfolio. 
So today, 1 year after that initial launch, there are more than 43 styles using Space Hippie innovations across 4 sports, 3 brands and our full consumer construct. For instance, you can see it come to life in iconic franchises such as the Air Force 1 crater, new performance innovation platforms like Cosmic Unity and even in our hands-free accessibility line with styles like Glide FlyEase. By driving new dimensions across platforms, our work to scale Space Hippie's innovations catalyze growth. Consumers are clearly responding to sustainability as we're seeing very strong full-price sell-through for this family of product with vast opportunity to drive continued consumer and business value still ahead.
And this is just one example of how we lead with platforms and not just products. Our deliberate franchise and innovation management create scalable and sustainable impacts on our business, and I'm excited by the upcoming new innovation platforms we'll be introducing soon.
Next, let's discuss NIKE's increasing digital advantage. We continue to lead the industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that deepens relationships between consumers and our brands. Our advantage comes to life at retail in both digital as well as at the intersection of digital and physical. I'll discuss both here.
Even as physical retail revenue approach pre-pandemic levels, our Digital business this quarter grew double digits. This is the result of an unwavering focus on our strategy and the investments we've made against our end-to-end digital transformation. And so we continue to expect Digital to be our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22.
Now one of the best gauges for success in our Digital business is how strongly we're connecting with members. Our Digital growth is led by outsized member buying, which has seen a penetration increase of 14 points since last year. Our membership strategy is working as we increasingly use data and analytics to personalize member product offering and experiences. And we're seeing this come to life as repeat buying members grew more than 70% in the quarter.
Now part of our success stems from our constant focus on expanding what it means to be a Nike member. We brought this to life in Q1 by introducing a new launch experience exclusive to the SNKRS App that revolutionizes how we serve consumers. The new experience debuted in one of the year's most highly anticipated launches, the Off-White Dunk. For the launch last month, we rolled out our new elevated SNKRS Exclusive Access. This approach sends personalized purchase offers to members based on their engagement with SNKRS, past purchase attempts and other criteria using data science to drive digital member targeting. 
For example, 90% of the invitees for the Off-White Dunk went to members who had lost out on a prior Off-White collaboration over the past 2 years. The result, the Off-White Dunk end up in the hands of hundreds of thousands of our most deserving members, creating what we call exclusivity at scale. And this improved consumer experience has a positive impact on the entire business. We've seen that those who benefit from Exclusive Access on SNKRS spend more across NIKE, fueled by the energy of their win. So our increasingly personalized approach to launch, along with benefits like Member Days and exclusive Nike By You access, highlights how we continue to increase the value proposition of NIKE membership.
We're also leveraging our digital advantage by investing in our brick-and-mortar fleet to create a compelling retail footprint that supercharges how we serve consumers across physical and digital. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Los Angeles and toured some of our great retail there. I got to see a wide variety of stores, including our NIKE Live door in Long Beach, a community door in East L.A. and more. And across each and every store, what jumped out to me was our team. Their love for their community and their passion for our product and bringing it to life for consumers was inspiring and just awesome to see. 
I also enjoyed visiting a few strategic partner doors, including DICK's and Foot Locker. What's clear across the marketplace, both owned and partnered, is how online to offline is becoming second nature. We know that higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are driving better consumer experience and loyalty.
O2O services such as buy online, pick up in store and ship from store as well as the in-store shopping features of the Nike App drive our premium and seamless consumer experience. And we're starting to extend these innovative experiences globally. In Q1, we brought our Nike Rise, an immersive concept, to Seoul. Nike Seoul introduces new features to Live -- or Rise, rather, including Inside Track, an interactive RFID-enabled digital footwear table where shoppers can compare details for any 2 shoes simply by placing them on the table. 
Our digitally connected retail experiences are clearly resonating with consumers. This quarter, our in-line fleet grew over 70% in revenue, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We're seeing over-index growth from members, not just at digital but also at physical retail, with member-buying penetration up double digits since last year. And so we'll continue expanding these compelling experiences across our fleet in fiscal '22, driving that interplay between physical and digital retail. 
In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do, staying on the offense. The strength of our consumer demand around the world continues to give us confidence in our playbook and execution. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I am proud of our resilient and creative team across Nike, Jordan and Converse and the work we continue to deliver for consumers. Our confidence as we look long term has not changed one bit. We've already gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we're going to emerge from it even stronger yet.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

NIKE's acceleration to a more direct member-centric business model continues to fuel deep connections between consumers and our portfolio of brands. Drawing upon our culture of innovation, unmatched global scale and our industry-leading digital platform, we continue to serve the modern consumer as only NIKE can.
Our first quarter results proved again that our strategy is working. And NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling the transformation of our long-term financial model. Our relentless focus on serving the consumer translated into revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% versus the prior year.
The NIKE Brand remains distinctive and deeply connected in our key cities around the world. From New York to Paris, Shanghai to Tokyo, Nike continues to be consumers' #1 cool and favorite brand with a position that has gained strength as we've navigated through the pandemic.
Consumer demand for Nike, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly high. And our first quarter financial results would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain congestion, resulting in lack of available supply. Despite these headwinds, retail sales still grew double digits versus the prior year, including a record-setting back-to-school season in North America. 
SNKRS has increasingly become an indicator and barometer of brand heat now being operational at scale in 50 countries around the world. NIKE Digital is now 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, which is an increase of 2 points versus last year, with strong double-digit growth versus the prior year, even with broad reopening of physical retail. Digital is increasingly becoming a part of everyone's shopping journey, and we are well positioned to reach our vision of a 40% owned Digital business by fiscal '25. 
And coming back to marketplace health for a moment, we delivered strong growth in average selling price this quarter with continued improvement in full-price realization. This performance reflects our intentional efforts to manage the health of our product franchises as demand surges, to move available inventory to serve demand in the right channels and to drive a more premium experience for consumers.
This quarter, we exceeded our 65% full-price sales realization goal, which reflects the expectations that we put forward at our last Investor Day. As we accelerate our consumer-led digital transformation, we are developing and refining new capabilities that are transforming our operating model, quickly becoming a competitive advantage for NIKE. 
Central to these capabilities is scaling our digital-first supply chain to enable NIKE's digital growth while optimizing service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We are evolving our distribution network and forward deploying inventory closer to the consumer, leveraging data and advanced analytics. These actions will improve service levels, reduce carbon impact and ultimately reduce cost to fulfill an order. Our regional service center outside of Los Angeles opened 1 year ago, and we're excited with the opening of 2 more centers in Q1, one in the East Coast and one in Spain. 
Our investments in O2O services are putting our products in the path of more consumers and more efficiently optimizing our inventory. Today, we have at least 2 O2O services in each of our NIKE-owned stores in the U.S., and we are aggressively scaling these services across the globe.
Our Express Lane offense is also creating more and more agility across our portfolio. From creating locally relevant product on shorter lead times to leveraging a shared inventory pool across the marketplace, we are better conserving consumers with more operational flexibility, yielding higher profitability. This quarter, Express Lane grew roughly 20% versus the prior year and increased its share of overall business.
And last, the Nike App continues to enable a convergence between physical and digital shopping journeys, eliminating friction for consumers. From member-driven personalization and localization to building an endless aisle through digital integration with our most important wholesale partners, Consumer Direct Acceleration is transforming NIKE's operating model to move at the speed of the consumer.
Now let me turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 16% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all marketplace channels. NIKE Digital grew 25% and NIKE-owned stores grew 24%. Wholesale grew 5% in the quarter, negatively impacted by lower available inventory supply due to worsening transit times. Gross margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins and partially offset by increased ocean freight surcharges.
SG&A grew 20% versus the prior year. This was due to higher wage-related expenses, higher levels of brand activity connected to return to sport and strategic technology investments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11% compared to 11.5% for the same period last year. This was due to increased benefits from stock-based compensation and discrete items, offset by a shift in our earnings mix. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up 22% versus the prior year.
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 15% and EBIT grew 10%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong for the fifth consecutive season, energized this quarter by back to school and the return to sport. Retail sales for our performance business grew strong double digits during the fall season, led by running, fitness and basketball, powered by excitement from the Olympics, the new WNBA season and the NBA Finals. 
NIKE Direct grew more than 45%, with NIKE Digital now representing 26% share of business. Digital continued its momentum and grew more than 40%, increasing market share by outperforming industry trends with strong growth in traffic and repeat buying member activity. The return to physical retail accelerated NIKE-owned store growth of over 50% as we serve members with elevated experiences. 
NIKE-owned inventory increased 12% versus the prior year. This was driven by highly elevated in-transit inventory levels as transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels. This impacted product availability across the marketplace and our ability to serve strong levels of consumer demand, particularly in the wholesale channels. Closeout inventory was down double digits versus the prior year.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 26% on a reported basis. This region was energized by the Euro this summer, where NIKE players scored more goals than all other brands combined, and more than half of those goals were with our material boots. We saw a strong consumer response to both the material boot and replica jerseys during the tournament. NIKE Direct grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by our NIKE-owned stores. Following a full reopening, we saw traffic increase by double digits versus the prior year with better-than-expected conversion rates. 
In EMEA, while NIKE Digital grew 2% in the quarter, demand for full-price products grew nearly 30% as we compare to higher liquidation levels in the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 14% on a reported basis with closeout inventory down double digits. Transit times to EMEA have also deteriorated over the past 90 days, causing higher levels of in-transit inventory and negatively impacting product availability to serve strong consumer demand.
In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis as the team delivered in line with our own recovery expectations. Retail sales were impacted in late July and August due to regional closures and lower levels of foot traffic due to COVID containment. Prior to late July, physical traffic had been approaching prior year levels. In July, we engaged with consumers through the launch of our Joy of Sports local marketing campaign. This campaign generated over 1 billion local views, demonstrating strong brand connection with Chinese consumers. 
NIKE Direct declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis, partially impacted by retail closures. NIKE Digital declined 6% as we compare to higher liquidation in the prior year, partially offset by double-digit improvement in full-price sales mix. We experienced a strong 6/18 consumer moment where we grew nearly 10% versus the prior year and remained the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Demand in our SNKRS App grew more than 130% for the quarter. Our experienced local team continues to navigate through marketplace dynamics. We finished the quarter with healthy marketplace weeks of supply, and inventory normalization is on plan.
Now moving to APLA. First quarter revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 72% on a reported basis. Revenue growth was led by SOCO, Japan, Mexico and Korea, with more muted growth in Pacific and Southeast Asia and India due to COVID restrictions and government-mandated store closures. NIKE Digital grew more than 60% on a currency-neutral basis, highlighted by the expansion of our Nike App. In June, the app went live in Mexico and 6 additional countries across Southeast Asia, generating 3 million local downloads during the quarter.
Earlier on the call, John spoke about the new Nike Rise retail experience in Seoul. To mark the opening of the store, our Express Lane, SNKRS and Nike Rise teams created the Nike Seoul Dunk. This collaboration drove more than half of day 1 sales and highlight how digital and physical experiences are converging in our own stores, leveraging local insights and a more agile supply model.
Now I will turn to our financial outlook. Consumer demand for NIKE remains at an all-time high, and we are confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue. However, we are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the manufacture and movement of product around the world. 
Previously, I had shared that we were planning for transit times to remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated even further in the first quarter, with North America and EMEA seeing increases in transit times due primarily to port and rail congestion and labor shortages. Additionally, several of our factory partners in Vietnam and Indonesia were required to abruptly cease operations in the first quarter. As of today, Indonesia is now fully operational. But in Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate.
Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time. Therefore, we're revising our short-term financial outlook to incorporate the following factors: 10 weeks of production already lost in Vietnam since mid-July; factory reopening to occur in phases beginning in October with a ramp to full production over several months; and elevated transit times consistent with where we are now operating today.
We now expect fiscal '22 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth due solely to the supply chain impacts that I just described. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits versus the prior year as factory closures have impacted production and delivery times for the holiday and spring seasons. Lost weeks of production, combined with longer transit times, will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters.
We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors. However, those geographies in Asia with less in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter will experience a disproportionate impact beginning in Q2. For the balance of fiscal '22, we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply. We are optimistic inventory supply availability will improve heading into fiscal '23 against the backdrop of a very strong brand and healthy pull market across all geographies.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. We still expect gross margin to expand 125 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger-than-expected full-price realization, the ongoing shift to our more profitable NIKE Direct business and price increases in the second half. This more than offsets roughly 100 basis points of additional transportation, logistics and airfreight costs to move inventory in this dynamic environment. We also expect a lower foreign exchange benefit, now estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 60 basis points. And for the second quarter, we expect gross margin to expand at a rate lower than the full year due to higher planned airfreight investment for the holiday season.
We expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens. We intend to maintain our position as the #1 cool and favorite brand and to celebrate the return to sport as we inspire and engage consumers around the world. We will also maintain pace on our multiyear investment plans in order to transform our business for the future, as I've outlined in prior quarters. NIKE's financial strength is a competitive advantage, and it is in moments like these where our competitive strengths and strong balance sheet affords us the ability to remain focused on what's required to win and serve consumers for the long term.
In closing, our vision for NIKE's long-term future remains unchanged. NIKE is a growth company with unlimited potential. Despite new short-term operational dynamics, our Consumer Direct Acceleration offense is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model toward the long-term fiscal '25 financial outlook I shared last quarter. This quarter's impressive results are additional proof that our strategy is right not only for the moment we find ourselves in but also for the opportunity to serve the future of athletes and sport like only NIKE can. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone, and there is no better team to navigate through volatility and lead long-term transformational change.
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. As I said",685,"Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. 
As I said earlier, consumer demand has never been higher, and we expect strong demand to continue for quarters to come. Over the last 90 days, 2 things have happened in the industry that we didn't anticipate. First, already long transit times worsened; and second, local governments mandated shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Keep in mind that there are global complexities and differences in transit times and sourcing mix across our geographies, so I'm going to use North America as an example to just go a little deeper on what I'm talking about. Prior to the pandemic, it would have taken approximately 40 days to move product from Asia to North America. Transit times have been increasing due to container shortages, port congestion, rail congestion and labor shortages, impacting the entire industry. And during Q1, these lead times worsened further to now sit at 80 days, roughly 2x normal. 
So here's where the geo-specific piece comes in. So as we finished Q1 with higher levels of in-transit inventory, that means that we had full price inventory that was unavailable to use to serve current consumer demand in this quarter. We would have had an even stronger top line result if we had more product available to serve that consumer demand. And so these elevated transit times that we're seeing, we've been talking about them now for several quarters, and they worsened this quarter, continue to have an impact on our business. 
And then in addition to that, there's Vietnam. And it's important to think about these 2 impacts together. As of today, 80% of our footwear factories located in the South and nearly half of our apparel factories in Vietnam are currently closed. So through this week, that means we've already lost 10 weeks of production, and that gap will continue until factories are able to reopen and produce product at normal capacity. So this has created a gap to the flow of inventory originally ordered for delivery beginning in mid-October. And our experience shows us, based on navigating through this pandemic over the last 18 months, that it's going to take several months to ramp back to full production. 
Now on a positive note, a few factories have just had their reopening plans approved, like this week. And so we're optimistic about a phased reopening and ramp of production beginning in October. And as I said in the call -- earlier in the call, Indonesia is already operational, and they're ramping back up to capacity. 
So North America is coming into Q2 with elevated in-transit inventory, which means North America will have higher quantities of fall season product that it can sell in the second quarter. But holiday and spring production has been delayed. And if you combine that with longer lead times, the impact of the lost production is going to have a greater impact in North America in Q3. Conversely, Greater China, which has lower levels of in-transit inventory and shorter transit times because it's closer to the factories, is going to experience the impact of the lost production earlier in Q2. 
Our teams are leveraging their experience and our operational playbook and taking actions to try to mitigate these impacts. And they're doing things like maximizing our footwear production capacity in other countries, shifting apparel production out of Vietnam to other countries like Indonesia and China and others where viable, strategically leveraging airfreight. And then we're continuing to employ a seasonless approach to product to serve incredibly strong consumer demand, given our success that we've had selling at full price, even if the product reaches the market later than we expected. 
So while the environment is dynamic, these supply chain issues, we believe, are temporary. And from what we can see today, we're optimistic that available inventory supply will be improved as we head into fiscal year '23."

I mean it's -- so I would say traditional sports is what I'll call it, is strong and back. And that's also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. 
Second thing we're seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport, whether that's in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate, right? And it's that young generation, Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. 
But also coming out of pandemic, the definition of sport, I think, is getting to every athlete [ asterisk ] in different ways, just the concept of movements and health and the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so part of the tailwind we're seeing is sport is becoming part of everyone's everyday life. And that's a powerful tailwind for us. 
And then athleisure, that's blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life, is also what we view as a tailwind. So we're doubling down on traditional sport, on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future."

And we created a multiyear investment plan against our outlook to drive that growth. 
And when we finished the first quarter, we finished our first quarter spending at about 29% of revenue. And as we think about the transitory nature of these impacts, we believe this is a moment where NIKE's financial strength is a real competitive advantage. And so we believe these short-term dynamics will pass, but we're more convinced and committed to what we believe the capabilities we need to operate a consumer direct business at scale as we execute the strategy. 
And so that's where our focus and attention is going to be. We're going to keep our teams focused on creating those capabilities and -- which we're seeing translate into strong growth and profitability. And that also includes the investments that we're making from a brand perspective. Strong brands get stronger in this environment. And having that deep consumer connection, especially when it's rooted to sport and the return of sport, is absolutely what we need to be doing in order to continue to stay in a position of strength."

So on the pricing question, we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've taken some pricing actions in the second half. And what I would say, Simeon, is that we evaluate price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And we consider a number of different factors that we incorporate to make a decision about what to do. But what I will tell you is that we take a long -- we have a long-standing relationship with our consumer. And so we take a long-term view to these types of decisions. 
And so the price increases that we've implemented in the second half are in the low single-digit range. And we feel it's appropriate given the marketplace we're operating in and those other factors that I referenced, considering we've got rising input costs and other factors that are impacting our business. 
But I think it's really important not to drive past the fact that we continue to see strong growth in ASPs across the whole marketplace driven by higher full-price realization as we've been talking about for several quarters and lower markdowns and leveraging the capabilities of identifying our inventory, knowing where we want to put it, putting it in the path of the consumer, optimizing it between ourselves and our physical locations, our digital locations and increasingly providing that endless access to some of our wholesale -- to some of our most strategic wholesale partners. 
All of these things are contributing to a higher level of full-price realization across the marketplace. And so we do believe that this is a base from where we want to operate as opposed to a moment in time, and that's driving profitability for NIKE at a moment that -- where there's lots of disruption. 
I think in terms of your second question in terms of undifferentiated or differentiated, what I would tell you is that we continue to see strong growth in our differentiated partners. And our differentiated partners, because of the fact that they are creating a better consumer experience and driving more demand, their weeks of inventory on hand is about half where they would like for it to be right now because of the strong demand that they're driving. 
And to take it a step further, over the last 3 years, we've actually exited about 50% of our undifferentiated accounts while we've been able to deliver strong double-digit growth. And so we believe that we will continue down this strategy. And as John alluded to in his prepared remarks, we believe that the supply-related reductions will likely trigger an even greater acceleration in the transformation of the marketplace towards NIKE and our most important wholesale partners."

We've lost 10 weeks of production since mid-July. And so what we're really focused on is are our factory partners getting back to full capacity so that we can serve demand that we see in the marketplace. When we combine the lost production and the reramping plus the extended lead times, we feel optimistic that we're going to see inventory supply improving as we exit this fiscal year and move into fiscal year '23. And our experience would tell us that while this situation is going to be dynamic and it's not going to be linear, that's what we're planning towards at this point in time."

We're doing what great sports teams do, which is making -- confronting the reality, making adjustments, showing agility and executing in a way where we emerge stronger. 
And so we had demand shocks last year with the closing of retail in Phase 1 of pandemic. And now we've got some supply shocks with Phase 2 of the pandemic this year. We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think we're stronger today than we were 18 months ago, and we'll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport. And as we saw again in Q1, our strategy is working with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation, commitment to purpose and proven operational playbook, we stay at the front of the pack.
Q1 was another strong quarter for NIKE, with revenue growth of 16%. And even as we saw physical retail traffic return across much of the portfolio, digital continued its momentum with 25% currency-neutral growth, led by North America at over 40. Our digital success is evidence of the product innovation, brand strength and scale that drives our meaningful relationships with consumers as we continue to show momentum against our biggest growth priorities.
As has been the case since the start of pandemic, I'm proud of the way our entire NIKE, Inc. team has delivered through macro volatility. Over the past 18 months, we've demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulence to emerge even stronger and better positioned. And that's what we'll continue to do as we navigate through these current supply chain issues. We'll focus on what we can control while leveraging the many levers at our disposal. You'll hear Matt walk through our mitigation efforts in a few minutes.
Today, we're in a stronger position relative to our competition than we were prior to the pandemic. Why? Because the changes happening in the market work in our favor. Consumers' shift to digital that might have taken 5 years will now only take 2. That plays to NIKE's advantage. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is capitalizing on this marketplace transformation. We know that when we get to the other side of this, we'll be in even stronger shape. We'll be more agile, more direct and more digital.
So we remain focused and confident in our long-term business outlook. Our competitive advantages, including our innovative product, brand strength fueled by compelling storytelling, our roster of the world's best athletes and increasingly, our industry-leading digital experiences at retail will continue to create separation. As we drive strong, sustained consumer demand, our confidence remains undiminished.
We've just wrapped up an incredible summer of sport, highlighted, of course, by the Olympics and Paralympics. And moments like these are exciting for our company because sport energizes our roughly 75,000 employees around the world. You can just feel it. And it's through that passion for sport that we continue to innovate and connect to the consumer.
And this summer in Tokyo, our leadership as the world's most innovative sports brand was demonstrated once again. If NIKE were a country, we would have eclipsed the competition, capturing 226 medals, including 85 golds.
Here are a few examples of what excited us most this summer. We saw the emergence of Gen Z as a powerful next generation of athletes led by a pair of 13-year-old skateboarders who showed us the joy in the expansion of the definition of sport. We shined in key team sports, including football, where Nike teams took home gold in both men's and women's; and basketball, where Nike and Jordan teams combined to take 5 of the 6 medals, including both golds. And we continued our great legacy in track and field with NIKE athletes winning more individual medals in track and field events than all other brands combined.
And at the same time, the European Championships brought incredible energy to football in Q1 with England making it to the final. Our brand anthem, The Land of New Footfall, brought a fresh approach to the sport, representing NIKE's vision that in this game, everyone is welcome. The film saw more than 800 million impressions across all channels as more than half of EMEA's Gen Z population viewed it at least once.
And the summer sport also saw Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA title after an electrifying finals against Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Days later, we released Giannis' latest signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 3, which is built to support the dominant physicality that defines his style of play. We continue to see strong response to the Zoom Freak, and we're excited by what we're seeing with our growing Giannis business.
And speaking of Devin Booker, Q1 was a great reminder of how we're investing in the next generation of superstars as we continue to build our roster of athletes. Jordan Brand signed the NFL's Dak Prescott in the quarter, joining emerging global icons in NIKE, Inc.'s family, including U.S. Open Winner, Emma Raducanu, and Manchester United's Jadon Sancho.
At the end of the quarter, the summer sport gave way to back-to-school season. So far this fall, we've seen sell-through in our kids business up almost 30%, led by digital with growth of almost 70. As we focus on the kids opportunity, our new consumer construct, through that, we are connecting with families more authentically than ever before. We're creating kid-specific designs and leveraging new channels for us to connect with these consumers. 
Take for example Playlist, which is a just-for-kids series on nike.com and YouTube. It's filled with games, challenges and exclusive athlete content, all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement and play. Its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring LeBron James and some of his costars from their movie Space Jam: A New Legacy. Playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations.
And our kids business remains an important connection point for us, an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long term. We're the largest kids athletic footwear brand in the world, but we know that there is still so much potential ahead.
And as I've said before, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. Our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage. And this week, I toured our new LeBron James innovation center here at our world headquarters with LeBron. At over 750,000 square feet, this new home for our innovation teams is 5x the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of NIKE's leadership in sports science. We expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further.
And looking at our innovation agenda, the 2 areas that I'd like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition: apparel and sustainability. First, let's take a look at apparel. We're seeing strong over-indexing growth of 16% in this key growth driver. And the investments we're making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher apparel growth for women's led by our yoga business. Our yoga collection today features multiple industry-leading innovations, including Dri-FIT and Infinalon. These innovations are resonating with consumers and have helped us nearly quadruple our yoga business over the past 2 years.
Another key apparel story for us in Q1 was our bras business. This quarter, we maintained our #1 market share in sports bras in North America and introduced the Nike Dri-FIT ADV Swoosh bra. Dri-FIT ADV combines the ultimate and cooling fabrics with highly engineered methods to make. It's an innovation that's connected with consumers as we scale this technology across our line.
And now to take a look at sustainability, look at what we've done with Space Hippie. Space Hippie, as you may recall, is quite literally made from trash. And it was originally introduced at our 2020 Future Forum and debuted 4 separate sustainable material innovations for us, including crater foam and space waste yarn. Now since then, we have strategically grown this franchise to global scale. And what's more, we've also scaled these individual material innovations across our entire portfolio. 
So today, 1 year after that initial launch, there are more than 43 styles using Space Hippie innovations across 4 sports, 3 brands and our full consumer construct. For instance, you can see it come to life in iconic franchises such as the Air Force 1 crater, new performance innovation platforms like Cosmic Unity and even in our hands-free accessibility line with styles like Glide FlyEase. By driving new dimensions across platforms, our work to scale Space Hippie's innovations catalyze growth. Consumers are clearly responding to sustainability as we're seeing very strong full-price sell-through for this family of product with vast opportunity to drive continued consumer and business value still ahead.
And this is just one example of how we lead with platforms and not just products. Our deliberate franchise and innovation management create scalable and sustainable impacts on our business, and I'm excited by the upcoming new innovation platforms we'll be introducing soon.
Next, let's discuss NIKE's increasing digital advantage. We continue to lead the industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that deepens relationships between consumers and our brands. Our advantage comes to life at retail in both digital as well as at the intersection of digital and physical. I'll discuss both here.
Even as physical retail revenue approach pre-pandemic levels, our Digital business this quarter grew double digits. This is the result of an unwavering focus on our strategy and the investments we've made against our end-to-end digital transformation. And so we continue to expect Digital to be our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22.
Now one of the best gauges for success in our Digital business is how strongly we're connecting with members. Our Digital growth is led by outsized member buying, which has seen a penetration increase of 14 points since last year. Our membership strategy is working as we increasingly use data and analytics to personalize member product offering and experiences. And we're seeing this come to life as repeat buying members grew more than 70% in the quarter.
Now part of our success stems from our constant focus on expanding what it means to be a Nike member. We brought this to life in Q1 by introducing a new launch experience exclusive to the SNKRS App that revolutionizes how we serve consumers. The new experience debuted in one of the year's most highly anticipated launches, the Off-White Dunk. For the launch last month, we rolled out our new elevated SNKRS Exclusive Access. This approach sends personalized purchase offers to members based on their engagement with SNKRS, past purchase attempts and other criteria using data science to drive digital member targeting. 
For example, 90% of the invitees for the Off-White Dunk went to members who had lost out on a prior Off-White collaboration over the past 2 years. The result, the Off-White Dunk end up in the hands of hundreds of thousands of our most deserving members, creating what we call exclusivity at scale. And this improved consumer experience has a positive impact on the entire business. We've seen that those who benefit from Exclusive Access on SNKRS spend more across NIKE, fueled by the energy of their win. So our increasingly personalized approach to launch, along with benefits like Member Days and exclusive Nike By You access, highlights how we continue to increase the value proposition of NIKE membership.
We're also leveraging our digital advantage by investing in our brick-and-mortar fleet to create a compelling retail footprint that supercharges how we serve consumers across physical and digital. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Los Angeles and toured some of our great retail there. I got to see a wide variety of stores, including our NIKE Live door in Long Beach, a community door in East L.A. and more. And across each and every store, what jumped out to me was our team. Their love for their community and their passion for our product and bringing it to life for consumers was inspiring and just awesome to see. 
I also enjoyed visiting a few strategic partner doors, including DICK's and Foot Locker. What's clear across the marketplace, both owned and partnered, is how online to offline is becoming second nature. We know that higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are driving better consumer experience and loyalty.
O2O services such as buy online, pick up in store and ship from store as well as the in-store shopping features of the Nike App drive our premium and seamless consumer experience. And we're starting to extend these innovative experiences globally. In Q1, we brought our Nike Rise, an immersive concept, to Seoul. Nike Seoul introduces new features to Live -- or Rise, rather, including Inside Track, an interactive RFID-enabled digital footwear table where shoppers can compare details for any 2 shoes simply by placing them on the table. 
Our digitally connected retail experiences are clearly resonating with consumers. This quarter, our in-line fleet grew over 70% in revenue, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We're seeing over-index growth from members, not just at digital but also at physical retail, with member-buying penetration up double digits since last year. And so we'll continue expanding these compelling experiences across our fleet in fiscal '22, driving that interplay between physical and digital retail. 
In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do, staying on the offense. The strength of our consumer demand around the world continues to give us confidence in our playbook and execution. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I am proud of our resilient and creative team across Nike, Jordan and Converse and the work we continue to deliver for consumers. Our confidence as we look long term has not changed one bit. We've already gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we're going to emerge from it even stronger yet.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

NIKE's acceleration to a more direct member-centric business model continues to fuel deep connections between consumers and our portfolio of brands. Drawing upon our culture of innovation, unmatched global scale and our industry-leading digital platform, we continue to serve the modern consumer as only NIKE can.
Our first quarter results proved again that our strategy is working. And NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling the transformation of our long-term financial model. Our relentless focus on serving the consumer translated into revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% versus the prior year.
The NIKE Brand remains distinctive and deeply connected in our key cities around the world. From New York to Paris, Shanghai to Tokyo, Nike continues to be consumers' #1 cool and favorite brand with a position that has gained strength as we've navigated through the pandemic.
Consumer demand for Nike, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly high. And our first quarter financial results would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain congestion, resulting in lack of available supply. Despite these headwinds, retail sales still grew double digits versus the prior year, including a record-setting back-to-school season in North America. 
SNKRS has increasingly become an indicator and barometer of brand heat now being operational at scale in 50 countries around the world. NIKE Digital is now 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, which is an increase of 2 points versus last year, with strong double-digit growth versus the prior year, even with broad reopening of physical retail. Digital is increasingly becoming a part of everyone's shopping journey, and we are well positioned to reach our vision of a 40% owned Digital business by fiscal '25. 
And coming back to marketplace health for a moment, we delivered strong growth in average selling price this quarter with continued improvement in full-price realization. This performance reflects our intentional efforts to manage the health of our product franchises as demand surges, to move available inventory to serve demand in the right channels and to drive a more premium experience for consumers.
This quarter, we exceeded our 65% full-price sales realization goal, which reflects the expectations that we put forward at our last Investor Day. As we accelerate our consumer-led digital transformation, we are developing and refining new capabilities that are transforming our operating model, quickly becoming a competitive advantage for NIKE. 
Central to these capabilities is scaling our digital-first supply chain to enable NIKE's digital growth while optimizing service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We are evolving our distribution network and forward deploying inventory closer to the consumer, leveraging data and advanced analytics. These actions will improve service levels, reduce carbon impact and ultimately reduce cost to fulfill an order. Our regional service center outside of Los Angeles opened 1 year ago, and we're excited with the opening of 2 more centers in Q1, one in the East Coast and one in Spain. 
Our investments in O2O services are putting our products in the path of more consumers and more efficiently optimizing our inventory. Today, we have at least 2 O2O services in each of our NIKE-owned stores in the U.S., and we are aggressively scaling these services across the globe.
Our Express Lane offense is also creating more and more agility across our portfolio. From creating locally relevant product on shorter lead times to leveraging a shared inventory pool across the marketplace, we are better conserving consumers with more operational flexibility, yielding higher profitability. This quarter, Express Lane grew roughly 20% versus the prior year and increased its share of overall business.
And last, the Nike App continues to enable a convergence between physical and digital shopping journeys, eliminating friction for consumers. From member-driven personalization and localization to building an endless aisle through digital integration with our most important wholesale partners, Consumer Direct Acceleration is transforming NIKE's operating model to move at the speed of the consumer.
Now let me turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 16% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all marketplace channels. NIKE Digital grew 25% and NIKE-owned stores grew 24%. Wholesale grew 5% in the quarter, negatively impacted by lower available inventory supply due to worsening transit times. Gross margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins and partially offset by increased ocean freight surcharges.
SG&A grew 20% versus the prior year. This was due to higher wage-related expenses, higher levels of brand activity connected to return to sport and strategic technology investments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11% compared to 11.5% for the same period last year. This was due to increased benefits from stock-based compensation and discrete items, offset by a shift in our earnings mix. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up 22% versus the prior year.
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 15% and EBIT grew 10%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong for the fifth consecutive season, energized this quarter by back to school and the return to sport. Retail sales for our performance business grew strong double digits during the fall season, led by running, fitness and basketball, powered by excitement from the Olympics, the new WNBA season and the NBA Finals. 
NIKE Direct grew more than 45%, with NIKE Digital now representing 26% share of business. Digital continued its momentum and grew more than 40%, increasing market share by outperforming industry trends with strong growth in traffic and repeat buying member activity. The return to physical retail accelerated NIKE-owned store growth of over 50% as we serve members with elevated experiences. 
NIKE-owned inventory increased 12% versus the prior year. This was driven by highly elevated in-transit inventory levels as transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels. This impacted product availability across the marketplace and our ability to serve strong levels of consumer demand, particularly in the wholesale channels. Closeout inventory was down double digits versus the prior year.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 26% on a reported basis. This region was energized by the Euro this summer, where NIKE players scored more goals than all other brands combined, and more than half of those goals were with our material boots. We saw a strong consumer response to both the material boot and replica jerseys during the tournament. NIKE Direct grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by our NIKE-owned stores. Following a full reopening, we saw traffic increase by double digits versus the prior year with better-than-expected conversion rates. 
In EMEA, while NIKE Digital grew 2% in the quarter, demand for full-price products grew nearly 30% as we compare to higher liquidation levels in the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 14% on a reported basis with closeout inventory down double digits. Transit times to EMEA have also deteriorated over the past 90 days, causing higher levels of in-transit inventory and negatively impacting product availability to serve strong consumer demand.
In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis as the team delivered in line with our own recovery expectations. Retail sales were impacted in late July and August due to regional closures and lower levels of foot traffic due to COVID containment. Prior to late July, physical traffic had been approaching prior year levels. In July, we engaged with consumers through the launch of our Joy of Sports local marketing campaign. This campaign generated over 1 billion local views, demonstrating strong brand connection with Chinese consumers. 
NIKE Direct declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis, partially impacted by retail closures. NIKE Digital declined 6% as we compare to higher liquidation in the prior year, partially offset by double-digit improvement in full-price sales mix. We experienced a strong 6/18 consumer moment where we grew nearly 10% versus the prior year and remained the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Demand in our SNKRS App grew more than 130% for the quarter. Our experienced local team continues to navigate through marketplace dynamics. We finished the quarter with healthy marketplace weeks of supply, and inventory normalization is on plan.
Now moving to APLA. First quarter revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 72% on a reported basis. Revenue growth was led by SOCO, Japan, Mexico and Korea, with more muted growth in Pacific and Southeast Asia and India due to COVID restrictions and government-mandated store closures. NIKE Digital grew more than 60% on a currency-neutral basis, highlighted by the expansion of our Nike App. In June, the app went live in Mexico and 6 additional countries across Southeast Asia, generating 3 million local downloads during the quarter.
Earlier on the call, John spoke about the new Nike Rise retail experience in Seoul. To mark the opening of the store, our Express Lane, SNKRS and Nike Rise teams created the Nike Seoul Dunk. This collaboration drove more than half of day 1 sales and highlight how digital and physical experiences are converging in our own stores, leveraging local insights and a more agile supply model.
Now I will turn to our financial outlook. Consumer demand for NIKE remains at an all-time high, and we are confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue. However, we are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the manufacture and movement of product around the world. 
Previously, I had shared that we were planning for transit times to remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated even further in the first quarter, with North America and EMEA seeing increases in transit times due primarily to port and rail congestion and labor shortages. Additionally, several of our factory partners in Vietnam and Indonesia were required to abruptly cease operations in the first quarter. As of today, Indonesia is now fully operational. But in Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate.
Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time. Therefore, we're revising our short-term financial outlook to incorporate the following factors: 10 weeks of production already lost in Vietnam since mid-July; factory reopening to occur in phases beginning in October with a ramp to full production over several months; and elevated transit times consistent with where we are now operating today.
We now expect fiscal '22 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth due solely to the supply chain impacts that I just described. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits versus the prior year as factory closures have impacted production and delivery times for the holiday and spring seasons. Lost weeks of production, combined with longer transit times, will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters.
We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors. However, those geographies in Asia with less in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter will experience a disproportionate impact beginning in Q2. For the balance of fiscal '22, we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply. We are optimistic inventory supply availability will improve heading into fiscal '23 against the backdrop of a very strong brand and healthy pull market across all geographies.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. We still expect gross margin to expand 125 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger-than-expected full-price realization, the ongoing shift to our more profitable NIKE Direct business and price increases in the second half. This more than offsets roughly 100 basis points of additional transportation, logistics and airfreight costs to move inventory in this dynamic environment. We also expect a lower foreign exchange benefit, now estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 60 basis points. And for the second quarter, we expect gross margin to expand at a rate lower than the full year due to higher planned airfreight investment for the holiday season.
We expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens. We intend to maintain our position as the #1 cool and favorite brand and to celebrate the return to sport as we inspire and engage consumers around the world. We will also maintain pace on our multiyear investment plans in order to transform our business for the future, as I've outlined in prior quarters. NIKE's financial strength is a competitive advantage, and it is in moments like these where our competitive strengths and strong balance sheet affords us the ability to remain focused on what's required to win and serve consumers for the long term.
In closing, our vision for NIKE's long-term future remains unchanged. NIKE is a growth company with unlimited potential. Despite new short-term operational dynamics, our Consumer Direct Acceleration offense is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model toward the long-term fiscal '25 financial outlook I shared last quarter. This quarter's impressive results are additional proof that our strategy is right not only for the moment we find ourselves in but also for the opportunity to serve the future of athletes and sport like only NIKE can. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone, and there is no better team to navigate through volatility and lead long-term transformational change.
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

291981,1678088904,2403455,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 23, 2021",2021-09-23,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. As I said",685,"Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. 
As I said earlier, consumer demand has never been higher, and we expect strong demand to continue for quarters to come. Over the last 90 days, 2 things have happened in the industry that we didn't anticipate. First, already long transit times worsened; and second, local governments mandated shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Keep in mind that there are global complexities and differences in transit times and sourcing mix across our geographies, so I'm going to use North America as an example to just go a little deeper on what I'm talking about. Prior to the pandemic, it would have taken approximately 40 days to move product from Asia to North America. Transit times have been increasing due to container shortages, port congestion, rail congestion and labor shortages, impacting the entire industry. And during Q1, these lead times worsened further to now sit at 80 days, roughly 2x normal. 
So here's where the geo-specific piece comes in. So as we finished Q1 with higher levels of in-transit inventory, that means that we had full price inventory that was unavailable to use to serve current consumer demand in this quarter. We would have had an even stronger top line result if we had more product available to serve that consumer demand. And so these elevated transit times that we're seeing, we've been talking about them now for several quarters, and they worsened this quarter, continue to have an impact on our business. 
And then in addition to that, there's Vietnam. And it's important to think about these 2 impacts together. As of today, 80% of our footwear factories located in the South and nearly half of our apparel factories in Vietnam are currently closed. So through this week, that means we've already lost 10 weeks of production, and that gap will continue until factories are able to reopen and produce product at normal capacity. So this has created a gap to the flow of inventory originally ordered for delivery beginning in mid-October. And our experience shows us, based on navigating through this pandemic over the last 18 months, that it's going to take several months to ramp back to full production. 
Now on a positive note, a few factories have just had their reopening plans approved, like this week. And so we're optimistic about a phased reopening and ramp of production beginning in October. And as I said in the call -- earlier in the call, Indonesia is already operational, and they're ramping back up to capacity. 
So North America is coming into Q2 with elevated in-transit inventory, which means North America will have higher quantities of fall season product that it can sell in the second quarter. But holiday and spring production has been delayed. And if you combine that with longer lead times, the impact of the lost production is going to have a greater impact in North America in Q3. Conversely, Greater China, which has lower levels of in-transit inventory and shorter transit times because it's closer to the factories, is going to experience the impact of the lost production earlier in Q2. 
Our teams are leveraging their experience and our operational playbook and taking actions to try to mitigate these impacts. And they're doing things like maximizing our footwear production capacity in other countries, shifting apparel production out of Vietnam to other countries like Indonesia and China and others where viable, strategically leveraging airfreight. And then we're continuing to employ a seasonless approach to product to serve incredibly strong consumer demand, given our success that we've had selling at full price, even if the product reaches the market later than we expected. 
So while the environment is dynamic, these supply chain issues, we believe, are temporary. And from what we can see today, we're optimistic that available inventory supply will be improved as we head into fiscal year '23."

I mean it's -- so I would say traditional sports is what I'll call it, is strong and back. And that's also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. 
Second thing we're seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport, whether that's in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate, right? And it's that young generation, Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. 
But also coming out of pandemic, the definition of sport, I think, is getting to every athlete [ asterisk ] in different ways, just the concept of movements and health and the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so part of the tailwind we're seeing is sport is becoming part of everyone's everyday life. And that's a powerful tailwind for us. 
And then athleisure, that's blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life, is also what we view as a tailwind. So we're doubling down on traditional sport, on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future."

As our -- as we said earlier, in all seriousness, millions and millions of SNKRS users. What a great experience. And obviously, that line is just another example of how NIKE is unparalleled in our ability to create real innovative, stylish heat and connection with the consumer."

So on the pricing question, we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've taken some pricing actions in the second half. And what I would say, Simeon, is that we evaluate price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And we consider",450,"Yes. So on the pricing question, we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've taken some pricing actions in the second half. And what I would say, Simeon, is that we evaluate price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And we consider a number of different factors that we incorporate to make a decision about what to do. But what I will tell you is that we take a long -- we have a long-standing relationship with our consumer. And so we take a long-term view to these types of decisions. 
And so the price increases that we've implemented in the second half are in the low single-digit range. And we feel it's appropriate given the marketplace we're operating in and those other factors that I referenced, considering we've got rising input costs and other factors that are impacting our business. 
But I think it's really important not to drive past the fact that we continue to see strong growth in ASPs across the whole marketplace driven by higher full-price realization as we've been talking about for several quarters and lower markdowns and leveraging the capabilities of identifying our inventory, knowing where we want to put it, putting it in the path of the consumer, optimizing it between ourselves and our physical locations, our digital locations and increasingly providing that endless access to some of our wholesale -- to some of our most strategic wholesale partners. 
All of these things are contributing to a higher level of full-price realization across the marketplace. And so we do believe that this is a base from where we want to operate as opposed to a moment in time, and that's driving profitability for NIKE at a moment that -- where there's lots of disruption. 
I think in terms of your second question in terms of undifferentiated or differentiated, what I would tell you is that we continue to see strong growth in our differentiated partners. And our differentiated partners, because of the fact that they are creating a better consumer experience and driving more demand, their weeks of inventory on hand is about half where they would like for it to be right now because of the strong demand that they're driving. 
And to take it a step further, over the last 3 years, we've actually exited about 50% of our undifferentiated accounts while we've been able to deliver strong double-digit growth. And so we believe that we will continue down this strategy. And as John alluded to in his prepared remarks, we believe that the supply-related reductions will likely trigger an even greater acceleration in the transformation of the marketplace towards NIKE and our most important wholesale partners."

We've lost 10 weeks of production since mid-July. And so what we're really focused on is are our factory partners getting back to full capacity so that we can serve demand that we see in the marketplace. When we combine the lost production and the reramping plus the extended lead times, we feel optimistic that we're going to see inventory supply improving as we exit this fiscal year and move into fiscal year '23. And our experience would tell us that while this situation is going to be dynamic and it's not going to be linear, that's what we're planning towards at this point in time."

We're doing what great sports teams do, which is making -- confronting the reality, making adjustments, showing agility and executing in a way where we emerge stronger. 
And so we had demand shocks last year with the closing of retail in Phase 1 of pandemic. And now we've got some supply shocks with Phase 2 of the pandemic this year. We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think we're stronger today than we were 18 months ago, and we'll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today. And in the process, we're building that capability where we're leveraging our strengths and we're leveraging the leadership position.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport.

NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport. And as we saw again in Q1, our strategy is working with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation, commitment to purpose and proven operational playbook, we stay at the front of the pack.
Q1 was another strong quarter for NIKE, with revenue growth of 16%. And even as we saw physical retail traffic return across much of the portfolio, digital continued its momentum with 25% currency-neutral growth, led by North America at over 40. Our digital success is evidence of the product innovation, brand strength and scale that drives our meaningful relationships with consumers as we continue to show momentum against our biggest growth priorities.
As has been the case since the start of pandemic, I'm proud of the way our entire NIKE, Inc. team has delivered through macro volatility. Over the past 18 months, we've demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulence to emerge even stronger and better positioned. And that's what we'll continue to do as we navigate through these current supply chain issues. We'll focus on what we can control while leveraging the many levers at our disposal. You'll hear Matt walk through our mitigation efforts in a few minutes.
Today, we're in a stronger position relative to our competition than we were prior to the pandemic. Why? Because the changes happening in the market work in our favor. Consumers' shift to digital that might have taken 5 years will now only take 2. That plays to NIKE's advantage. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is capitalizing on this marketplace transformation. We know that when we get to the other side of this, we'll be in even stronger shape. We'll be more agile, more direct and more digital.
So we remain focused and confident in our long-term business outlook. Our competitive advantages, including our innovative product, brand strength fueled by compelling storytelling, our roster of the world's best athletes and increasingly, our industry-leading digital experiences at retail will continue to create separation. As we drive strong, sustained consumer demand, our confidence remains undiminished.
We've just wrapped up an incredible summer of sport, highlighted, of course, by the Olympics and Paralympics. And moments like these are exciting for our company because sport energizes our roughly 75,000 employees around the world. You can just feel it. And it's through that passion for sport that we continue to innovate and connect to the consumer.
And this summer in Tokyo, our leadership as the world's most innovative sports brand was demonstrated once again. If NIKE were a country, we would have eclipsed the competition, capturing 226 medals, including 85 golds.
Here are a few examples of what excited us most this summer. We saw the emergence of Gen Z as a powerful next generation of athletes led by a pair of 13-year-old skateboarders who showed us the joy in the expansion of the definition of sport. We shined in key team sports, including football, where Nike teams took home gold in both men's and women's; and basketball, where Nike and Jordan teams combined to take 5 of the 6 medals, including both golds. And we continued our great legacy in track and field with NIKE athletes winning more individual medals in track and field events than all other brands combined.
And at the same time, the European Championships brought incredible energy to football in Q1 with England making it to the final. Our brand anthem, The Land of New Footfall, brought a fresh approach to the sport, representing NIKE's vision that in this game, everyone is welcome. The film saw more than 800 million impressions across all channels as more than half of EMEA's Gen Z population viewed it at least once.
And the summer sport also saw Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA title after an electrifying finals against Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Days later, we released Giannis' latest signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 3, which is built to support the dominant physicality that defines his style of play. We continue to see strong response to the Zoom Freak, and we're excited by what we're seeing with our growing Giannis business.
And speaking of Devin Booker, Q1 was a great reminder of how we're investing in the next generation of superstars as we continue to build our roster of athletes. Jordan Brand signed the NFL's Dak Prescott in the quarter, joining emerging global icons in NIKE, Inc.'s family, including U.S. Open Winner, Emma Raducanu, and Manchester United's Jadon Sancho.
At the end of the quarter, the summer sport gave way to back-to-school season. So far this fall, we've seen sell-through in our kids business up almost 30%, led by digital with growth of almost 70. As we focus on the kids opportunity, our new consumer construct, through that, we are connecting with families more authentically than ever before. We're creating kid-specific designs and leveraging new channels for us to connect with these consumers. 
Take for example Playlist, which is a just-for-kids series on nike.com and YouTube. It's filled with games, challenges and exclusive athlete content, all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement and play. Its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring LeBron James and some of his costars from their movie Space Jam: A New Legacy. Playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations.
And our kids business remains an important connection point for us, an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long term. We're the largest kids athletic footwear brand in the world, but we know that there is still so much potential ahead.
And as I've said before, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. Our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage. And this week, I toured our new LeBron James innovation center here at our world headquarters with LeBron. At over 750,000 square feet, this new home for our innovation teams is 5x the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of NIKE's leadership in sports science. We expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further.
And looking at our innovation agenda, the 2 areas that I'd like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition: apparel and sustainability. First, let's take a look at apparel. We're seeing strong over-indexing growth of 16% in this key growth driver. And the investments we're making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher apparel growth for women's led by our yoga business. Our yoga collection today features multiple industry-leading innovations, including Dri-FIT and Infinalon. These innovations are resonating with consumers and have helped us nearly quadruple our yoga business over the past 2 years.
Another key apparel story for us in Q1 was our bras business. This quarter, we maintained our #1 market share in sports bras in North America and introduced the Nike Dri-FIT ADV Swoosh bra. Dri-FIT ADV combines the ultimate and cooling fabrics with highly engineered methods to make. It's an innovation that's connected with consumers as we scale this technology across our line.
And now to take a look at sustainability, look at what we've done with Space Hippie. Space Hippie, as you may recall, is quite literally made from trash. And it was originally introduced at our 2020 Future Forum and debuted 4 separate sustainable material innovations for us, including crater foam and space waste yarn. Now since then, we have strategically grown this franchise to global scale. And what's more, we've also scaled these individual material innovations across our entire portfolio. 
So today, 1 year after that initial launch, there are more than 43 styles using Space Hippie innovations across 4 sports, 3 brands and our full consumer construct. For instance, you can see it come to life in iconic franchises such as the Air Force 1 crater, new performance innovation platforms like Cosmic Unity and even in our hands-free accessibility line with styles like Glide FlyEase. By driving new dimensions across platforms, our work to scale Space Hippie's innovations catalyze growth. Consumers are clearly responding to sustainability as we're seeing very strong full-price sell-through for this family of product with vast opportunity to drive continued consumer and business value still ahead.
And this is just one example of how we lead with platforms and not just products. Our deliberate franchise and innovation management create scalable and sustainable impacts on our business, and I'm excited by the upcoming new innovation platforms we'll be introducing soon.
Next, let's discuss NIKE's increasing digital advantage. We continue to lead the industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that deepens relationships between consumers and our brands. Our advantage comes to life at retail in both digital as well as at the intersection of digital and physical. I'll discuss both here.
Even as physical retail revenue approach pre-pandemic levels, our Digital business this quarter grew double digits. This is the result of an unwavering focus on our strategy and the investments we've made against our end-to-end digital transformation. And so we continue to expect Digital to be our leading channel for growth in fiscal '22.
Now one of the best gauges for success in our Digital business is how strongly we're connecting with members. Our Digital growth is led by outsized member buying, which has seen a penetration increase of 14 points since last year. Our membership strategy is working as we increasingly use data and analytics to personalize member product offering and experiences. And we're seeing this come to life as repeat buying members grew more than 70% in the quarter.
Now part of our success stems from our constant focus on expanding what it means to be a Nike member. We brought this to life in Q1 by introducing a new launch experience exclusive to the SNKRS App that revolutionizes how we serve consumers. The new experience debuted in one of the year's most highly anticipated launches, the Off-White Dunk. For the launch last month, we rolled out our new elevated SNKRS Exclusive Access. This approach sends personalized purchase offers to members based on their engagement with SNKRS, past purchase attempts and other criteria using data science to drive digital member targeting. 
For example, 90% of the invitees for the Off-White Dunk went to members who had lost out on a prior Off-White collaboration over the past 2 years. The result, the Off-White Dunk end up in the hands of hundreds of thousands of our most deserving members, creating what we call exclusivity at scale. And this improved consumer experience has a positive impact on the entire business. We've seen that those who benefit from Exclusive Access on SNKRS spend more across NIKE, fueled by the energy of their win. So our increasingly personalized approach to launch, along with benefits like Member Days and exclusive Nike By You access, highlights how we continue to increase the value proposition of NIKE membership.
We're also leveraging our digital advantage by investing in our brick-and-mortar fleet to create a compelling retail footprint that supercharges how we serve consumers across physical and digital. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Los Angeles and toured some of our great retail there. I got to see a wide variety of stores, including our NIKE Live door in Long Beach, a community door in East L.A. and more. And across each and every store, what jumped out to me was our team. Their love for their community and their passion for our product and bringing it to life for consumers was inspiring and just awesome to see. 
I also enjoyed visiting a few strategic partner doors, including DICK's and Foot Locker. What's clear across the marketplace, both owned and partnered, is how online to offline is becoming second nature. We know that higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are driving better consumer experience and loyalty.
O2O services such as buy online, pick up in store and ship from store as well as the in-store shopping features of the Nike App drive our premium and seamless consumer experience. And we're starting to extend these innovative experiences globally. In Q1, we brought our Nike Rise, an immersive concept, to Seoul. Nike Seoul introduces new features to Live -- or Rise, rather, including Inside Track, an interactive RFID-enabled digital footwear table where shoppers can compare details for any 2 shoes simply by placing them on the table. 
Our digitally connected retail experiences are clearly resonating with consumers. This quarter, our in-line fleet grew over 70% in revenue, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We're seeing over-index growth from members, not just at digital but also at physical retail, with member-buying penetration up double digits since last year. And so we'll continue expanding these compelling experiences across our fleet in fiscal '22, driving that interplay between physical and digital retail. 
In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do, staying on the offense. The strength of our consumer demand around the world continues to give us confidence in our playbook and execution. I said it earlier and I'll say it again, I am proud of our resilient and creative team across Nike, Jordan and Converse and the work we continue to deliver for consumers. Our confidence as we look long term has not changed one bit. We've already gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we're going to emerge from it even stronger yet.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

NIKE's acceleration to a more direct member-centric business model continues to fuel deep connections between consumers and our portfolio of brands. Drawing upon our culture of innovation, unmatched global scale and our industry-leading digital platform, we continue to serve the modern consumer as only NIKE can.
Our first quarter results proved again that our strategy is working. And NIKE's Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling the transformation of our long-term financial model. Our relentless focus on serving the consumer translated into revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% versus the prior year.
The NIKE Brand remains distinctive and deeply connected in our key cities around the world. From New York to Paris, Shanghai to Tokyo, Nike continues to be consumers' #1 cool and favorite brand with a position that has gained strength as we've navigated through the pandemic.
Consumer demand for Nike, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly high. And our first quarter financial results would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain congestion, resulting in lack of available supply. Despite these headwinds, retail sales still grew double digits versus the prior year, including a record-setting back-to-school season in North America. 
SNKRS has increasingly become an indicator and barometer of brand heat now being operational at scale in 50 countries around the world. NIKE Digital is now 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, which is an increase of 2 points versus last year, with strong double-digit growth versus the prior year, even with broad reopening of physical retail. Digital is increasingly becoming a part of everyone's shopping journey, and we are well positioned to reach our vision of a 40% owned Digital business by fiscal '25. 
And coming back to marketplace health for a moment, we delivered strong growth in average selling price this quarter with continued improvement in full-price realization. This performance reflects our intentional efforts to manage the health of our product franchises as demand surges, to move available inventory to serve demand in the right channels and to drive a more premium experience for consumers.
This quarter, we exceeded our 65% full-price sales realization goal, which reflects the expectations that we put forward at our last Investor Day. As we accelerate our consumer-led digital transformation, we are developing and refining new capabilities that are transforming our operating model, quickly becoming a competitive advantage for NIKE. 
Central to these capabilities is scaling our digital-first supply chain to enable NIKE's digital growth while optimizing service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We are evolving our distribution network and forward deploying inventory closer to the consumer, leveraging data and advanced analytics. These actions will improve service levels, reduce carbon impact and ultimately reduce cost to fulfill an order. Our regional service center outside of Los Angeles opened 1 year ago, and we're excited with the opening of 2 more centers in Q1, one in the East Coast and one in Spain. 
Our investments in O2O services are putting our products in the path of more consumers and more efficiently optimizing our inventory. Today, we have at least 2 O2O services in each of our NIKE-owned stores in the U.S., and we are aggressively scaling these services across the globe.
Our Express Lane offense is also creating more and more agility across our portfolio. From creating locally relevant product on shorter lead times to leveraging a shared inventory pool across the marketplace, we are better conserving consumers with more operational flexibility, yielding higher profitability. This quarter, Express Lane grew roughly 20% versus the prior year and increased its share of overall business.
And last, the Nike App continues to enable a convergence between physical and digital shopping journeys, eliminating friction for consumers. From member-driven personalization and localization to building an endless aisle through digital integration with our most important wholesale partners, Consumer Direct Acceleration is transforming NIKE's operating model to move at the speed of the consumer.
Now let me turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 16% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all marketplace channels. NIKE Digital grew 25% and NIKE-owned stores grew 24%. Wholesale grew 5% in the quarter, negatively impacted by lower available inventory supply due to worsening transit times. Gross margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins and partially offset by increased ocean freight surcharges.
SG&A grew 20% versus the prior year. This was due to higher wage-related expenses, higher levels of brand activity connected to return to sport and strategic technology investments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11% compared to 11.5% for the same period last year. This was due to increased benefits from stock-based compensation and discrete items, offset by a shift in our earnings mix. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up 22% versus the prior year.
Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 15% and EBIT grew 10%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong for the fifth consecutive season, energized this quarter by back to school and the return to sport. Retail sales for our performance business grew strong double digits during the fall season, led by running, fitness and basketball, powered by excitement from the Olympics, the new WNBA season and the NBA Finals. 
NIKE Direct grew more than 45%, with NIKE Digital now representing 26% share of business. Digital continued its momentum and grew more than 40%, increasing market share by outperforming industry trends with strong growth in traffic and repeat buying member activity. The return to physical retail accelerated NIKE-owned store growth of over 50% as we serve members with elevated experiences. 
NIKE-owned inventory increased 12% versus the prior year. This was driven by highly elevated in-transit inventory levels as transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels. This impacted product availability across the marketplace and our ability to serve strong levels of consumer demand, particularly in the wholesale channels. Closeout inventory was down double digits versus the prior year.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 26% on a reported basis. This region was energized by the Euro this summer, where NIKE players scored more goals than all other brands combined, and more than half of those goals were with our material boots. We saw a strong consumer response to both the material boot and replica jerseys during the tournament. NIKE Direct grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by our NIKE-owned stores. Following a full reopening, we saw traffic increase by double digits versus the prior year with better-than-expected conversion rates. 
In EMEA, while NIKE Digital grew 2% in the quarter, demand for full-price products grew nearly 30% as we compare to higher liquidation levels in the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 14% on a reported basis with closeout inventory down double digits. Transit times to EMEA have also deteriorated over the past 90 days, causing higher levels of in-transit inventory and negatively impacting product availability to serve strong consumer demand.
In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis as the team delivered in line with our own recovery expectations. Retail sales were impacted in late July and August due to regional closures and lower levels of foot traffic due to COVID containment. Prior to late July, physical traffic had been approaching prior year levels. In July, we engaged with consumers through the launch of our Joy of Sports local marketing campaign. This campaign generated over 1 billion local views, demonstrating strong brand connection with Chinese consumers. 
NIKE Direct declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis, partially impacted by retail closures. NIKE Digital declined 6% as we compare to higher liquidation in the prior year, partially offset by double-digit improvement in full-price sales mix. We experienced a strong 6/18 consumer moment where we grew nearly 10% versus the prior year and remained the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Demand in our SNKRS App grew more than 130% for the quarter. Our experienced local team continues to navigate through marketplace dynamics. We finished the quarter with healthy marketplace weeks of supply, and inventory normalization is on plan.
Now moving to APLA. First quarter revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 72% on a reported basis. Revenue growth was led by SOCO, Japan, Mexico and Korea, with more muted growth in Pacific and Southeast Asia and India due to COVID restrictions and government-mandated store closures. NIKE Digital grew more than 60% on a currency-neutral basis, highlighted by the expansion of our Nike App. In June, the app went live in Mexico and 6 additional countries across Southeast Asia, generating 3 million local downloads during the quarter.
Earlier on the call, John spoke about the new Nike Rise retail experience in Seoul. To mark the opening of the store, our Express Lane, SNKRS and Nike Rise teams created the Nike Seoul Dunk. This collaboration drove more than half of day 1 sales and highlight how digital and physical experiences are converging in our own stores, leveraging local insights and a more agile supply model.
Now I will turn to our financial outlook. Consumer demand for NIKE remains at an all-time high, and we are confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue. However, we are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the manufacture and movement of product around the world. 
Previously, I had shared that we were planning for transit times to remain elevated for the balance of fiscal '22. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated even further in the first quarter, with North America and EMEA seeing increases in transit times due primarily to port and rail congestion and labor shortages. Additionally, several of our factory partners in Vietnam and Indonesia were required to abruptly cease operations in the first quarter. As of today, Indonesia is now fully operational. But in Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate.
Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time. Therefore, we're revising our short-term financial outlook to incorporate the following factors: 10 weeks of production already lost in Vietnam since mid-July; factory reopening to occur in phases beginning in October with a ramp to full production over several months; and elevated transit times consistent with where we are now operating today.
We now expect fiscal '22 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth due solely to the supply chain impacts that I just described. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits versus the prior year as factory closures have impacted production and delivery times for the holiday and spring seasons. Lost weeks of production, combined with longer transit times, will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters.
We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors. However, those geographies in Asia with less in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter will experience a disproportionate impact beginning in Q2. For the balance of fiscal '22, we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply. We are optimistic inventory supply availability will improve heading into fiscal '23 against the backdrop of a very strong brand and healthy pull market across all geographies.
Turning to the rest of the P&L. We still expect gross margin to expand 125 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger-than-expected full-price realization, the ongoing shift to our more profitable NIKE Direct business and price increases in the second half. This more than offsets roughly 100 basis points of additional transportation, logistics and airfreight costs to move inventory in this dynamic environment. We also expect a lower foreign exchange benefit, now estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 60 basis points. And for the second quarter, we expect gross margin to expand at a rate lower than the full year due to higher planned airfreight investment for the holiday season.
We expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens. We intend to maintain our position as the #1 cool and favorite brand and to celebrate the return to sport as we inspire and engage consumers around the world. We will also maintain pace on our multiyear investment plans in order to transform our business for the future, as I've outlined in prior quarters. NIKE's financial strength is a competitive advantage, and it is in moments like these where our competitive strengths and strong balance sheet affords us the ability to remain focused on what's required to win and serve consumers for the long term.
In closing, our vision for NIKE's long-term future remains unchanged. NIKE is a growth company with unlimited potential. Despite new short-term operational dynamics, our Consumer Direct Acceleration offense is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model toward the long-term fiscal '25 financial outlook I shared last quarter. This quarter's impressive results are additional proof that our strategy is right not only for the moment we find ourselves in but also for the opportunity to serve the future of athletes and sport like only NIKE can. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone, and there is no better team to navigate through volatility and lead long-term transformational change.
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. As I said",685,"Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. 
As I said earlier, consumer demand has never been higher, and we expect strong demand to continue for quarters to come. Over the last 90 days, 2 things have happened in the industry that we didn't anticipate. First, already long transit times worsened; and second, local governments mandated shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Keep in mind that there are global complexities and differences in transit times and sourcing mix across our geographies, so I'm going to use North America as an example to just go a little deeper on what I'm talking about. Prior to the pandemic, it would have taken approximately 40 days to move product from Asia to North America. Transit times have been increasing due to container shortages, port congestion, rail congestion and labor shortages, impacting the entire industry. And during Q1, these lead times worsened further to now sit at 80 days, roughly 2x normal. 
So here's where the geo-specific piece comes in. So as we finished Q1 with higher levels of in-transit inventory, that means that we had full price inventory that was unavailable to use to serve current consumer demand in this quarter. We would have had an even stronger top line result if we had more product available to serve that consumer demand. And so these elevated transit times that we're seeing, we've been talking about them now for several quarters, and they worsened this quarter, continue to have an impact on our business. 
And then in addition to that, there's Vietnam. And it's important to think about these 2 impacts together. As of today, 80% of our footwear factories located in the South and nearly half of our apparel factories in Vietnam are currently closed. So through this week, that means we've already lost 10 weeks of production, and that gap will continue until factories are able to reopen and produce product at normal capacity. So this has created a gap to the flow of inventory originally ordered for delivery beginning in mid-October. And our experience shows us, based on navigating through this pandemic over the last 18 months, that it's going to take several months to ramp back to full production. 
Now on a positive note, a few factories have just had their reopening plans approved, like this week. And so we're optimistic about a phased reopening and ramp of production beginning in October. And as I said in the call -- earlier in the call, Indonesia is already operational, and they're ramping back up to capacity. 
So North America is coming into Q2 with elevated in-transit inventory, which means North America will have higher quantities of fall season product that it can sell in the second quarter. But holiday and spring production has been delayed. And if you combine that with longer lead times, the impact of the lost production is going to have a greater impact in North America in Q3. Conversely, Greater China, which has lower levels of in-transit inventory and shorter transit times because it's closer to the factories, is going to experience the impact of the lost production earlier in Q2. 
Our teams are leveraging their experience and our operational playbook and taking actions to try to mitigate these impacts. And they're doing things like maximizing our footwear production capacity in other countries, shifting apparel production out of Vietnam to other countries like Indonesia and China and others where viable, strategically leveraging airfreight. And then we're continuing to employ a seasonless approach to product to serve incredibly strong consumer demand, given our success that we've had selling at full price, even if the product reaches the market later than we expected. 
So while the environment is dynamic, these supply chain issues, we believe, are temporary. And from what we can see today, we're optimistic that available inventory supply will be improved as we head into fiscal year '23."

I mean it's -- so I would say traditional sports is what I'll call it, is strong and back. And that's also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. 
Second thing we're seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport, whether that's in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate, right? And it's that young generation, Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. 
But also coming out of pandemic, the definition of sport, I think, is getting to every athlete [ asterisk ] in different ways, just the concept of movements and health and the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so part of the tailwind we're seeing is sport is becoming part of everyone's everyday life. And that's a powerful tailwind for us. 
And then athleisure, that's blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life, is also what we view as a tailwind. So we're doubling down on traditional sport, on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future."

But I think it's really important not to drive past the fact that we continue to see strong growth in ASPs across the whole marketplace driven by higher full-price realization as we've been talking about for several quarters and lower markdowns and leveraging the capabilities of identifying our inventory, knowing where we want to put it, putting it in the path of the consumer, optimizing it between ourselves and our physical locations, our digital locations and increasingly providing that endless access to some of our wholesale -- to some of our most strategic wholesale partners. 
All of these things are contributing to a higher level of full-price realization across the marketplace. And so we do believe that this is a base from where we want to operate as opposed to a moment in time, and that's driving profitability for NIKE at a moment that -- where there's lots of disruption. 
I think in terms of your second question in terms of undifferentiated or differentiated, what I would tell you is that we continue to see strong growth in our differentiated partners. And our differentiated partners, because of the fact that they are creating a better consumer experience and driving more demand, their weeks of inventory on hand is about half where they would like for it to be right now because of the strong demand that they're driving. 
And to take it a step further, over the last 3 years, we've actually exited about 50% of our undifferentiated accounts while we've been able to deliver strong double-digit growth. And so we believe that we will continue down this strategy. And as John alluded to in his prepared remarks, we believe that the supply-related reductions will likely trigger an even greater acceleration in the transformation of the marketplace towards NIKE and our most important wholesale partners."

Well, Kimberly, our optimism stems from the fact that our factories are starting to have reopening plans approved. And that has happened this week. And so we're optimistic that we're going to start to see production begin in October. Our experience from the COVID-related closures in China earlier in the pandemic and then in Indonesia earlier this quarter tells us that it will take time for those factories to ramp back up to full capacity. 
We've lost 10 weeks of production since mid-July. And so what we're really focused on is are our factory partners getting back to full capacity so that we can serve demand that we see in the marketplace. When we combine the lost production and the reramping plus the extended lead times, we feel optimistic that we're going to see inventory supply improving as we exit this fiscal year and move into fiscal year '23. And our experience would tell us that while this situation is going to be dynamic and it's not going to be linear, that's what we're planning towards at this point in time."

We're doing what great sports teams do, which is making -- confronting the reality, making adjustments, showing agility and executing in a way where we emerge stronger. 
And so we had demand shocks last year with the closing of retail in Phase 1 of pandemic. And now we've got some supply shocks with Phase 2 of the pandemic this year. We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think we're stronger today than we were 18 months ago, and we'll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today. And in the process, we're building that capability where we're leveraging our strengths and we're leveraging the leadership position. 
And I just want to maybe conclude this call, Paul, by once again just expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation for the 75,000 NIKE teammates around the world, who day in and day out are adjusting to the circumstances on the field, are demonstrating teamwork and resilience and creativity to serve consumers and continuing to innovate.

Before I get into our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Virgil Abloh. Since 2016, Virgil has been a beloved member of the NIKE Jordan and Converse family. He was a brilliant creative force who shared a passion for challenging the status quo and pushing forward a new vision while inspiring multiple generations along the way. But what stood out to me personally about Virgil was his humility and is humanity. 
We offer our condolences to the many who shared a connection with Virgil. He will be missed greatly. 
As we look at Q2, the creativity and resilience of our entire NIKE Inc. team helped deliver another strong quarter. The results we delivered offered continued proof that our strategy is working even as we execute through global macroeconomic constraints. Whenever there's turbulence, I always go back to the fundamentals. And for NIKE, that means putting the consumer at the center and leveraging our long-term competitive advantages, which include a culture deeply rooted in innovation, a brand that deeply connects with consumers fueled by compelling storytelling and an unmatched sports marketing portfolio. And we believe a fourth emerging competitive advantage for us is digital as we are one of the few brands that can directly connect with and serve consumers at scale. 
We also continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that have accelerated during the pandemic, tailwinds that include a larger movement of health and fitness that is taking place around the world, consumers' desire to wear athletic footwear and apparel in all moments of their lives and expanding definition of sport. And last, the fundamental shift in consumer behavior towards digital plays to our increasing digital advantage. 
As I said before, challenges create opportunities for the strong brands to get stronger, and that's what's happening here. And we are now in a much stronger competitive position today than we were 18 months ago, and that trend continues. 
We're seeing the strength come to life this holiday season. Our brand's deep connection with the consumer is driving strong holiday sales, most notably with North American digital leading the industry over Black Friday week with close to 40% growth. 
And our Singles Day performance showcased our brand strength in Greater China as we added 13 million new members, and NIKE was again the #1 sport brand on Tmall. 
More broadly, this holiday season has shown the power of our digital transformation across the globe. Digital is the engine driving our consumer direct acceleration strategy. 
And Q2 was also another incredible quarter for sport, led by our deep roster of athletes and teams. Let me just touch on a few of the highlights from the quarter. 
Following the exciting end of the WNBA and MOB seasons, the energy around sport continues with the NBA, NFL, European Soccer and upcoming college football bowl season where 16 of the top 20 teams and 3 out of the 4 playoff participants are NIKE teams. When these leagues are as exciting as they are today, our business benefits. 
And NIKE athletes continue to lead the way across the sports landscape, highlighted by Barcelona Captain Alexia Puteas, who won the Ballon d'Or  as the Best Female Footballer in 2021. 
We are also thrilled to see Marcus Rashford receive his MBE from Prince William last month, an honor very well deserved for his work to support vulnerable children during the pandemic. 
And congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo for reaching yet another remarkable milestone, by becoming the first player in recorded history to score 800 career goals in official matches. 
And I also have to give a special shout out to Selene Flanigan, who was wearing the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next% when she completed the 6 World Marathon Majors in 6 weeks running each of them in under 2 hours and 47 minutes. This achievement offers all of us a reminder of the joy and unrelenting spirit of sport. 
As we deliver against our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, we continue to drive separation as the most innovative sports brand by delivering a constant pipeline of new products that, that's the standard. And what's more, we're aligning against our key growth drivers of women's, Jordan, apparel as well as our commitments to sustainability. 
In women's, we launched a brand-new shoe designed specifically for dancers. The Nike Air Sesh was designed by Tinker Hatfield in collaboration with professional dancers and choreographers, and it prioritizes both style and performance with a mid-cut leather upper and cushioned foam under the foot. We launched the Air Sesh for NIKE members first with a wider release to take place soon. 
And this new product comes as we welcome some of the world's best athletes to our global roster, including dance choreographer Paris Gobal and fitness athlete [indiscernible]. 
As we continue to accelerate our strategy and fuel the expanded definition of sport, we're able to more deeply connect with women and create an even sharper focus. 
And this quarter also saw the debut collection from the Serena Williams Design Crew, our apprenticeship program that advances diversity and design. The crew connects innovation, design and purpose in a uniquely powerful way, fueled by our commitment to the full spectrum of sport for women across performance and lifestyle. Serena joined us on campus a few months back to help open the Serena Williams building at our world headquarters, along with our LeBron James Innovation Center. These 2 buildings represent the most remarkable investment in sport innovation in the world. 
We were also thrilled to see the Jordan brand launch the HA-36. The HA-36 is NIKE, Inc.'s first shoe using [indiscernible], a process that creates material that is uniquely strong, lightweight and adaptable to all foot shapes, making the HA-36 one of the lightest Air Jordans ever. Consumers can expect to see us iterate on this innovation in future seasons. 
And in apparel, we're driving energy in the market through design that resonates with consumers. The latest NBA City Edition and MOB City Connect uniforms are great examples as we grow the culture of sport by listening to local team communities and using thoughtful design to celebrate the game. We also launched Fifth 8DB, the next generation of performance apparel that combines weather-ready tech and innovative design to help athletes take on extreme conditions. This represents the pinnacle of NIKE apparel innovation and is currently in NIKE's performance apparel collections. And next year, it will be available in NIKE lifestyle products across all platforms. 
And finally, in sustainability, we launched Alphafly NEXT Nature, our most sustainable performance shoe and our first sustainable performance running shoe. This continues the progress made by our Cosmic Unity sustainable basketball shoe by reaching more than 50% total recycled content by weight. Learnings from the Alphafly NEXT Nature will be scaled across our running line, creating higher performing products with more sustainable materials. We know the future of sport depends on a healthy planet and we remain committed to doing our part to protect that future. 
As we connect consumers with the strongest innovation athlete roster and brand storytelling in the world, we're also elevating their experience through one NIKE marketplace. We're creating the marketplace of the future where we serve consumers with seamless, consistent and premium experiences. 
Through NIKE membership, we increasingly know and serve our consumer across a connected marketplace. I'd like to highlight 3 examples from the quarter of how NIKE is driving a more elevated and premium member experience across the marketplace. 
First, we recently launched new wellness content and workouts featuring Meg Thee Stallion in our Nike Training Clube. Megan's content drove record high engagement drawing 2x increase in daily active users in NTC, and her curated looks saw more than double the demand compared to any other product content viewed during that same time period. 
Second, ahead of Singles Day in Greater China, we activated a new member experience on Tmall and improved the onboarding journey. As a result, the Nike flagship store on Tmall was the #1 brand for new member recruitment across sport, driving a 20-point increase in member demand penetration this year. 
And third, just last month, we announced a partnership with one of our strategic retail partners, Dick's Sporting Goods, who shares our vision for the future of retail, specifically, shopping and experiences that are amplified by digital and personal to each consumer's journey. This new partnership allows shoppers to link their NIKE member account and their DSG account together to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences. 
Recently, I had an opportunity to visit one of DSG's newest concepts, the House of Sport Door in Rochester, New York. I must say I was blown away at the store's unique service model, interactive sport experience and enhanced showcasing of product, which creates a true destination for consumers and will alter future expectations at retail. 
Our partnership with DSG is a new model of how brands and retailers work together delivering product experience and connection service to delight consumers at scale. 
We're fulfilling our vision that through connected member experiences and inventory, powered by connected data and technology, we can provide consumers with greater access to the very best of NIKE with more speed, convenience and connection to our brand and to support than ever before. And as we look forward, there is even more opportunity to connect consumers with NIKE across digital platforms that integrate sport, innovation, culture and commerce. 
For example, we recently opened a new space in our New York digital studio to produce the weekly sneakers live streams that are driving industry-leading engagement metrics. Weekly content includes launch previews in our Sneakers Live heating up show and a new Jordan franchise presented through the lens of female Jordan fans called Jaywalking. 
Our stories go deep and engage a 2-way interaction with the community. And as a result, our consumer engagement is 3x the industry average for live streams. 
And speaking of sneakers in Jordan, the first set of invitations for the HA-11 Cool Gray was sent to the largest female focus group yet and sold out in the first hour. The group was selected utilizing our new dedication score designed to reward member groups with high product affinity. We continue to see exclusive access serve as a defining marketing mechanism to connect with consumers. 
And in Q2, we also launched the 3D immersive world of NIKELAND on Roblox. NIKE is meeting young athletes wherever they are encouraging to let their imaginations run wild and rewarding real-world movement through new virtual experiences. 
And just last week, we welcomed RTFKT to the NIKE, Inc. family. The NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands have always thrived at the intersection of sport, creativity, innovation and culture. The RTFKT acquisition allows us to extend this reach to serve and delight consumers and creators in both the physical and virtual worlds. We'll invest in a very talented RTFKT team creator community and cutting-edge innovation to deliver next-generation experiences that involve the RTFKT and NIKE Inc. brands. 
Today, we're stronger than we were before the pandemic, and I couldn't be more excited by the opportunity ahead of us. Our results this quarter are evidence that our strategy is working. And as we close out 2021, I want to take a moment to personally thank our 75,000 global NIKE Inc. teammates for everything they've done this year. Through all we've navigated, this team has worked together with creativity and resilience to serve our consumers and serve our communities. This team is the greatest collection of talent in the world, and I want to sincerely thank them. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

As you've heard us say before, NIKE is a growth company with boundless potential. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming our operating model by driving deeper and more direct connections with consumers through digital. Our teams continue to navigate through unprecedented levels of volatility and with flexibility, agility and grace, leveraging the operational playbook we created at the onset of the pandemic to stay focused on what matters most. 
We have embraced new ways of working, elevated experienced players into new leadership roles, reorganized the company to create even deeper focus on the consumer and developed new capabilities to serve consumers directly with speed and at scale. 
NIKE's second quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we established 90 days ago, fueled by continued brand momentum, the strength of our product franchises with extraordinary levels of full-price realization and strong season-to-date holiday sales, offset by lower levels of available inventory supply relative to marketplace demand. 
As John mentioned, we had an incredible Black Friday week, with NIKE Direct in North America and EMEA, increasing over 20% versus the prior year on top of last year's meaningful gains. To accomplish this, I'm particularly proud of the work by our supply chain teams. In late October, I was able to visit our North America distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi, to review our expanding digital fulfillment capabilities and holiday readiness plans. Our teams are executing those plans with precision, optimizing available inventory to meet demand with improved service levels and lowering carbon impact, all enabled through technology and automation. 
Staying on the topic of supply chain a little longer, factory reopening in Vietnam is on plan. Nearly all impacted factories began reopening in October. As of today, all factories are operational, and employee attendance rates have improved with weekly footwear and apparel production now at roughly 80% of pre-closure volumes. In total, Vietnam factory closures caused us to cancel production of roughly 130 million units due to 3 months of lost production volume and several months to ramp back to full production. 
Compared to 90 days ago, we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal '23. 
Turning to our digital business. NIKE's digital growth is outperforming comparisons and being fueled by our member-centric focus. NIKE Digital grew 11% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, setting the pace for the industry. NIKE Digital is now 25% of total NIKE brand revenue, up 3 points versus the prior year and more than double the digital mix in fiscal '19. 
Enhanced onboarding experiences are attracting millions of new members into the top of the funnel, and we are focused heavily on member engagement and buying. Member engagement grew 27%, and repeat buyers grew 50% versus last year, driving overall higher AUR, AOV and member buying frequency. 40% of total digital demand this year is coming from our mobile apps, highlighting the strength of our digital platform. 
We now have over 79 million engaged members across our NIKE ecosystem. And as NIKE's digital ecosystem continues to grow, we are beginning to see the compounding benefits of scale from brand awareness and consumer connection to data-informed personalization and inventory utilization to loyalty. 
This quarter, we held our first globally coordinated member days event, setting records in member engagement. From member-exclusive product offerings to our first live stream member events from our Nike Town London and PasegDeGrascia store in Barcelona, we created a distinct member experience and set a record for weekly active users on the Nike app in North America. 
Now moving to one final topic. Connecting with today's consumers means serving them with the product they want, when and where they want it. Consumers want a premium, seamless and personalized experience with minimal friction across their journey to explore, engage, connect and purchase products from the brands they love. 
As we've discussed before, NIKE is focused on creating one NIKE marketplace that elevates the brand by creating direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for the NIKE member. 
Over the past 4 years, North America has reduced the number of wholesale accounts by roughly 50%, while delivering strong growth and recapturing consumer demand through NIKE Direct and our strategic wholesale partners, leading the way for NIKE. 
In the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% versus the prior year. pushing NIKE Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing NIKE Direct to 48% of total. In order to enable this growth and drive the shift in marketplace composition, we have accelerated investment to evolve our distribution network and scale a digital-first supply chain, leveraging advanced analytics, automation and technology. We have opened 2 new regional service centers on both coasts, which are able to deliver more units to consumers with shorter delivery times. We also enabled ship-from-store capabilities across our store fleet, all leveraging advanced analytics from our select acquisition. 
On automation, we've added more than 1,000 robots in our distribution centers to handle the digital growth. In our digital distribution center in Memphis, robots handled more than 10 million units that would have otherwise required manual labor. 
We continue to scale O2O consumer services across our store fleet, including buy online, pick up in store and digital order returns in store. Volumes are relatively small today, but we have significant opportunity to scale. We've also established new fulfillment models with key strategic partners to create inventory visibility across the marketplace, and optimize full-price digital demand. When we do this right, the consumer wins. 
The progress being made to create One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America's revenue growth and gross margin expansion for yet another quarter, illustrating how consumer-direct acceleration will fuel NIKE's growth and profitability towards the fiscal '25 outlook we shared in June. 
Now let me turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, led by 8% growth in NIKE Direct offset by a 6% decline in wholesale due to optimization of available inventory supply. 
NIKE Digital grew 11% and NIKE-owned stores grew 4% with significant improvements in traffic and higher conversion rates. 
Gross margin increased 280 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins due to lower markdowns, higher full price mix and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs. 
SG&A grew 15% versus the prior year, primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns, digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand, strategic technology investments and wage-related expenses. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.9% compared to 14.1% for the same period last year. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix and the effects of stock-based compensation. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.83, up 6% versus the prior year. 
Before we move into operating segment results, I want to recall a few points I made last quarter regarding the impact of Vietnam factory closures on the short-term performance of each of our geographies beginning in the second quarter. North America and EMEA finished the first quarter with high levels of in-transit inventory, resulting in prior season supply that was arriving late due to longer transit times, which could be sold in the second quarter. We saw that in our Q2 results. However, Greater China and APLA, located closer to our sourcing base with shorter standard transit times experienced a decline in units sold in the second quarter due to lost production and lower available inventory supply. We also saw that reflected in our Q2 results. With that in mind, let's review the operating segments. 
In North America, Q2 revenue grew 12% and EBIT grew 21%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong. with season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market growing double digits, energized by the continued momentum from the return to sport and the beginning of an outstanding holiday season. Performance Sports Dimensions delivered strong double-digit retail sales growth led by running, fitness and basketball on lower levels of sell-in due to available inventory supply. 
Women's retail sales grew high double digits, more than twice the rate of men's with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. NIKE Direct had an outstanding quarter. growing 30% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, digital maintained its momentum growing 40% and setting holiday records on Black Friday week. NIKE-owned stores also delivered strong double-digit growth, with traffic trending towards pre-pandemic levels and strong increases in AUR due to lower closeout inventory levels and significant year-over-year improvements in markdown rates and promotions. 
Despite strong retail sales momentum in the wholesale channel, revenue declined 1% as marketplace inventory levels remain lean and Vietnam factory closures and longer transit times disrupt the flow of inventory supply to meet marketplace demand. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 22% on a reported basis. Season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew double digits, with strong growth across all consumer segments. The region was energized by the start of the global football season and the Champions League tournament across the continent. NIKE players continue to dominate on the pitch with the Mercurial boot being the lead score in a number of European professional leagues. We saw a strong consumer response for the Mercurial boot and launch of the Champions League third kit. 
Wholesale revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we comped prior year market closures. NIKE Direct also grew 6%, led by double-digit growth in NIKE-owned stores, as we comp prior year store closures with traffic improvement due to tourism picking up and back-to-school holidays. 
NIKE Digital was down 1% as we compare to extraordinary levels of off-price sales in the prior year as the geography leverage digital in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory. This quarter, our full-price digital business grew over 20% resulting in a 30-point improvement in full price sales mix, double-digit growth in AUR and improvement in markdown rates and promotions. This contributed to strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and return on sales profitability. 
In Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 24% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 36% on a reported basis. However, season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market have trended more favorably. 
Results for this quarter were as expected, as we navigated lower full-price product supply, due to the Vietnam factory closures. We saw disproportionate impacts to our wholesale revenue, which declined 27% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct declined 21% with declines in both digital and physical retail channels. 
COVID-related lockdowns continue to drive volatility in retail traffic. However, we did see traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter. Digital declined 27%, partially impacted by delay in product launch timing on sneakers. 
Over the 11/11 consumer moment, we drove stronger digital performance with significant member acquisition and higher AOV through better engagement with consumers. 
While challenging, we continue to leverage our operational playbook and remain optimistic about the longer term in Greater China. This quarter, we extended our Joy of Sport brand campaign, utilizing local influencers, Olympians and other athletes that are part of NIKE's leading sports marketing portfolio in Greater China. The Jordan brand added to the energy by announcing their first female athlete signing in Asia with basketball player Young Shuo. To support this activity and normalize our marketing investment levels, we increased our investment in demand creation in the second quarter by more than 40% versus the prior year. 
Our local team remains focused on creating distinctive and authentic connections with Chinese consumers. We celebrated the 40th anniversary of NIKE's operations in China by using the Express Lane to reintroduce the original NIKE collection with robust storytelling on the history and heritage of these iconic products. During our first launch, all products sold through in the first hour. We will continue to expand the Express Lane to bring unique localized offerings to the consumer, leveraging our most popular global product franchises to drive uniquely NIKE energy in the marketplace. 
We see encouraging signs in Greater China. And while inventory supply has been a major disruption in the marketplace, we continue to expect fiscal '22 to be a year of recovery. Having said that, we expect to see sequential improvement from here beginning in the third quarter. 
Now moving to APLA. Q2 revenue declined 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 8% on a reported basis. Double-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis in SOCO, was offset by declines in Asia Pacific territories, which faced a greater impact from Vietnam factory closures as well as the business model shift in Brazil. season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew versus the prior year despite supply disruptions and door closures in SC&I and Pacific. NIKE Direct grew 6% led by NIKE Digital growth of 25%. 
Our teams maximized market moments with all territories delivering successful member days and locally relevant activations, including Singles Day in Southeast Asia, in Mexico and Cyber Week in Japan. 
Mexico's digital business more than doubled as we enabled the localized assortment and fulfillment capabilities through the Nike App. 
Finally, APLA continues to leverage the Express Lane, their digital ecosystem and global partnerships to create locally relevant product and meaningful engagement with consumers around the world. Consumers in APLA are highly connected, and our team continues to innovate on digital experiences that are locally relevant. 
The Dia de los Muertos footwear pack saw a 100% sell-through, and this story was extended to the world through our new partnership with Roblox. 
Now let's turn to our financial outlook. As we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic, it is becoming even more challenging to compare quarters and fiscal years due to multiple waves of COVID-related disruption at different times across the consumer marketplace and now supply chain. 
We expect the operating environment to remain volatile as COVID variants continue to cause disruption to business operations. Our fiscal '22 financial outlook reflects inventory supply significantly lagging consumer demand across NIKE's portfolio of brands. 
However, NIKE's long-term market opportunity is larger than ever. And so we remain focused on what we can control in the short term and on where we are heading through our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and on what is required to deliver on our fiscal '25 financial outlook. 
Specifically for fiscal '22, we continue to expect revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year, in line with guidance from 90 days ago. For Q3, we expect revenue to grow low single digits versus the prior year due to the ongoing impacts from lost production from COVID-related disruptions in Vietnam. 
We are raising our gross margin guidance to expand 150 basis points versus the prior year. We expect to continue benefiting from exceptional demand against the backdrop of lean marketplace inventory. Full price realization will remain above our long-term target with lower channel markdowns. However, we expect product costs to rise in the second half due to higher macro input costs. We're also planning for supply chain costs for the full year to increase relative to our estimates 90 days ago with a greater impact in the second half. 
Last, we now expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis point tailwind versus the prior year. 
We continue to expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens for the full year as demand creation spend normalizes, and we continue to invest in the capabilities to support our consumer-led digital transformation. We now expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the full year. 
Consumer Direct Acceleration is driving our business forward, and it is transforming our financial model. We continue to prove that we can manage through the uncertainty and volatility in the current operating environment. But we are doing more than just managing through. 
We are building NIKE for the future with deeper consumer connections, a pipeline of product innovation to serve the needs of the modern athlete and new operational capabilities required to serve consumers directly and digitally at scale. We have a clear vision of our brand's long-term future and so we remain focused on what is required to win over the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

As I mentioned, our factories are back operational at this point in time, and I referenced an 80% number across footwear and apparel. It actually skews a little lower in footwear and a little higher in apparel. But as we watch employee attendance rates each week, we continue to grow increasingly confident in the guidance that we provided last quarter. 
So last quarter, we said our factories would resume production on October 1, and we said it would take us several months to get back to weekly production capacity consistent with where we were prior to the factory closures. We're on that plan. 
So as we look at our guidance for the balance of the year, it reflects those continued assumptions. And relative to where we were 90 days ago, we're increasingly confident that inventory supply will normalize and that we'll be in a position to meet the incredible demand that we're seeing across the marketplace."

I'm just going to repeat what I said last quarter and the quarter before, which is Nike always has, and we always will, take a long-term view in China, right? We've been there for 40 years. Phil was in there very early. We have built up a very strong brand connection with the consumer in China. And we're going to continue to invest to lead in China. And so we're investing behind the various things that brought us to where we are today. 
First and foremost, we have a great local team. Andro Dong and her team are helping us navigate and shepherd through the current environment. Product innovations, at the top of our list, the most innovative product in the world that we consistently produce increasingly tailored to the Chinese consumer through our Express Lane. And Matt talked a little bit about that, and that more and more of what we do in China is tailored to that China consumer. 
Same thing on storytelling. Storytelling that's centered on local athletes and the local consumer. We mentioned the signing of the most recent Jordan sports marketing elite athlete and the live streaming. We're connecting with that local Chinese consumer on their terms. 
And then we continue to be responsible citizens. We've always invested to grow sport in China. We are continuing to do that. We care and are investing behind sustainability. And so the same fundamentals that have always been there, we believe, are the right fundamentals going forward. 
This quarter, as Matt said, the results were in line with what we expected, with all the supply shortages and other dimensions. And what I look at is when we are present and active with the consumer in China, how they're responding. We saw some very encouraging things. 
We were very active around Singles Day.  right? We mentioned 90 live streams in the month prior with over 70 million viewers. That led to 13 million new members. And NIKE, once again being #1 on the Tmall during that period in China. 
And so we're focusing on the long term. We're getting a little bit better each quarter, and we're going to continue on that path, working closely with our team there."

Omar, I just got to say I am so proud of how our team has navigated through the last 6 to 24 months. It's been an ongoing series, as you know, of start/stop, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of change. And our team has responded with resilience, with creativity, and with a lot of innovation. 
And I got to be honest, in hindsight, many of the changes that have been made accelerated progress that otherwise would have happened. And so we're actually in a stronger position today. I think we've actually benefited because of our team's efforts and demonstrated ability to respond even in a work-from-home environment. 
Now that said, we do believe over time that with innovation and a strong brand, we want to go to a hybrid model. As you know, in the United States, we have mandated vaccines and have a very high response rate to that. So we're ready to come back in a hybrid work environment when that's safe, and we prioritize that, safety of our employees.

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the biggest drivers of gross margin expansion this quarter, and frankly, the biggest driver relative to what we had guided 90 days ago was the level of full price realization and lower markdown rates versus what we had anticipated for a holiday season. And so we were surprised by it. And it just is reflective of the strength of the brand and the connections that we've got with consumers. 
As we look to the balance of the year, we are expecting full-price realization to stay high and above, especially in North America and EMEA, that goal that we provided at Investor Day a couple of years ago, and we expect discount rates to remain low. 
The impact, as you look at sequential quarters is that we started to see improvements in markdown rates in the second half of last year in those 2 geographies in particular. And so the year-over-year impact from tighter supply, higher full price realization and lower markdowns has a lesser of an impact in the second quarter. 
What I'd say longer term is we continue to evaluate full-price realization and the goals that we've set. And while we haven't changed them, we are above in a couple of markets. As inventory supply normalizes, we would expect that to come back down to where our goals are at, but we're also operating a far more agile operating model at this point in time and so -- led by NIKE Direct. And so we'll continue to evaluate it especially as it pertains to the long-term margin outlook we provided. We still are confident in that high 40s gross margin outlook through fiscal '25. But I think the effects that we're seeing in this first year with tightened supply may just change the trajectory of how we get there."

Number one, our brand's tracking tells us that our brand is still the #1 cool and favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, and it's strengthening -- and strengthening",430,"Sure, Matt. Let me just tell you the foundation with which I say it. Number one, our brand's tracking tells us that our brand is still the #1 cool and favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, and it's strengthening -- and strengthening against our historical competitors. In fact, the only people that are coming close are technology companies. And so that continues to be one evidence. 
But I think even more fundamentally in longer term is the foundation of having a direct connection with the consumer. We are in an era where that is the liquid gold for any brand is to have a direct connection with the consumer so that you can understand that consumer, you can engage that consumer and then you can serve them in a personalized way. And if you have a leadership position, you have more information with which to do all that, more data, more information. 
And so our digital penetration is at an all-time high. Matt mentioned [ it's ] 25%. Our Direct Digital and mono brand penetrations at an all-time high that gives us that direct connection. And frankly, the partnerships like DICK'S allows us to have that direct connection, whether it's direct or with a wholesale partner, and that allows us to serve that consumer in a more personalized, engaging and sustainable way. And we believe that is going to be one of the key indicators of future success. And not every brand in our industry or other industries is to be able to have that direct connection with consumers. And so that's the best leading indicator. And that's why we're putting so much focus on our full consumer funnel, bringing new members into the top of the funnel, engaging the mid-funnel and then obviously, translating that into strong and deep relationships. 
And so when you compare geographies, we're in this weird period where you got sort of numerator/denominator issues, right? Obviously, North America results were really strong this quarter. We had the supply and our team did a great job executing. 
In EMEA that for instance, the digital results reflected last year when we were sort of liquidating a lot of inventory when COVID just occurred. But I look at our full-price digital penetration, it was quite strong. So the quarter-to-quarter growth rates get a little bit hard to interpret because of supply issues because of the previous years, we're lapping store closures or -- but I would say we feel very good and very confident about being stronger in each of our regions."

And we've been -- we've talked about that both earlier today and last quarter. 
We also had to navigate through local measures that were put in place to reduce the spread of COVID. And what I mean by that is that 25% of our partner retail stores were impacted in the quarter in some way as a result of local mandates to affect operations, and 50% of our factory stores in Greater China were equal -- were similarly impacted. And so that was -- those were clearly the 2 biggest drivers that impacted our performance this quarter. 
I mentioned sneakers and the comparison challenges due to the delay of launch. But we've actually seen digital sequentially improving throughout the quarter. And so we're increasingly optimistic given our 11/11 performance in the way that we're sequentially improving. And as supply normalizes, as I referenced, we expect to see sequential improvement from these 2Q results. And as we restart our marketing activity and drive those connections with consumers, some of these signals that we're seeing these encouraging signs that we see give us a lot of confidence that our trajectory is going to improve from this quarter."

Before I get into our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Virgil Abloh. Since 2016, Virgil has been a beloved member of the NIKE Jordan and Converse family. He was a brilliant creative force who shared a passion for challenging the status quo and pushing forward a new vision while inspiring multiple generations along the way. But what stood out to me personally about Virgil was his humility and his humanity. 
We offer our condolences to the many who shared a connection with Virgil. He will be missed greatly. 
As we look at Q2, the creativity and resilience of our entire NIKE Inc. team helped deliver another strong quarter. The results we delivered offered continued proof that our strategy is working even as we execute through global macroeconomic constraints. Whenever there's turbulence, I always go back to the fundamentals. And for NIKE, that means putting the consumer at the center and leveraging our long-term competitive advantages, which include a culture deeply rooted in innovation, a brand that deeply connects with consumers fueled by compelling storytelling and an unmatched sports marketing portfolio. And we believe a fourth emerging competitive advantage for us is digital, as we are one of the few brands that can directly connect with and serve consumers at scale. 
We also continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that have accelerated during the pandemic, tailwinds that include a larger movement of health and fitness that is taking place around the world, consumers' desire to wear athletic footwear and apparel in all moments of their lives and expanding definition of sport. And last, the fundamental shift in consumer behavior towards digital plays to our increasing digital advantage. 
As I said before, challenges create opportunities for the strong brands to get stronger, and that's what's happening here. And we are now in a much stronger competitive position today than we were 18 months ago, and that trend continues. 
We're seeing the strength come to life this holiday season. Our brand's deep connection with the consumer is driving strong holiday sales, most notably with North American digital leading the industry over Black Friday week with close to 40% growth. 
And our Singles Day performance showcased our brand strength in Greater China as we added 13 million new members, and NIKE was again the #1 sport brand on Tmall. 
More broadly, this holiday season has shown the power of our digital transformation across the globe. Digital is the engine driving our consumer direct acceleration strategy. 
And Q2 was also another incredible quarter for sport, led by our deep roster of athletes and teams. Let me just touch on a few of the highlights from the quarter. 
Following the exciting end of the WNBA and MOB seasons, the energy around sport continues with the NBA, NFL, European Soccer and upcoming college football bowl season where 16 of the top 20 teams and 3 out of the 4 playoff participants are NIKE teams. When these leagues are as exciting as they are today, our business benefits. 
And NIKE athletes continue to lead the way across the sports landscape, highlighted by Barcelona Captain Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d'Or as the Best Female Footballer in 2021. 
We are also thrilled to see Marcus Rashford receive his MBE from Prince William last month, an honor very well deserved for his work to support vulnerable children during the pandemic. 
And congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo for reaching yet another remarkable milestone by becoming the first player in recorded history to score 800 career goals in official matches. 
And I also have to give a special shout-out to Shalane Flanagan, who was wearing the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next% when she completed the 6 World Marathon Majors in 6 weeks, running each of them in under 2 hours and 47 minutes. This achievement offers all of us a reminder of the joy and unrelenting spirit of sport. 
As we deliver against our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy, we continue to drive separation as the most innovative sports brand by delivering a constant pipeline of new products that sets the standard. And what's more, we're aligning against our key growth drivers of women's, Jordan, apparel as well as our commitments to sustainability. 
In women's, we launched a brand-new shoe designed specifically for dancers. The Nike Air Sesh was designed by Tinker Hatfield, in collaboration with professional dancers and choreographers, and it prioritizes both style and performance with a mid-cut leather upper and cushion foam under the foot. We launched the Air Sesh for NIKE members first, with a wider release to take place soon. 
And this new product comes as we welcome some of the world's best athletes to our global roster, including dance choreographer Parris Goebel and fitness athlete Tunde Oyeneyin. 
As we continue to accelerate our strategy and fuel the expanded definition of sport, we're able to more deeply connect with women and create an even sharper focus. 
And this quarter also saw the debut collection from the Serena Williams Design Crew, our apprenticeship program that advances diversity and design. The crew connects innovation, design and purpose in a uniquely powerful way, fueled by our commitment to the full spectrum of sport for women across performance and lifestyle. Serena joined us on campus a few months back to help open the Serena Williams Building at our World Headquarters. Along with our LeBron James Innovation Center, these 2 buildings represent the most remarkable investment in sport innovation in the world. 
We were also thrilled to see the Jordan brand launch the AJ36. The AJ36 is NIKE, Inc.'s first shoe using leno-weave, a process that creates material that is uniquely strong, lightweight and adaptable to all foot shapes, making the AJ36 one of the lightest Air Jordans ever. Consumers can expect to see us iterate on this innovation in future seasons. 
And in apparel, we're driving energy in the market through design that resonates with consumers. The latest NBA City Edition and MLB City Connect uniforms are great examples as we grow the culture of sport by listening to local team communities and using thoughtful design to celebrate the game. We also launched FIT ADV, the next generation of performance apparel that combines weather-ready tech and innovative design to help athletes take on extreme conditions. This represents the pinnacle of NIKE apparel innovation and is currently in NIKE's performance apparel collections. And next year, it will be available in NIKE lifestyle products across all platforms. 
And finally, in sustainability, we launched Alphafly NEXT Nature, our most sustainable performance shoe and our first sustainable performance running shoe. This continues the progress made by our Cosmic Unity sustainable basketball shoe by reaching more than 50% total recycled content by weight. Learnings from the Alphafly Next Nature will be scaled across our running line, creating higher performing products with more sustainable materials. We know the future of sport depends on a healthy planet and we remain committed to doing our part to protect that future. 
As we connect consumers with the strongest innovation, athlete roster and brand storytelling in the world, we're also elevating their experience through One Nike Marketplace. We're creating the marketplace of the future where we serve consumers with seamless, consistent and premium experiences. 
Through NIKE membership, we increasingly know and serve our consumer across a connected marketplace. I'd like to highlight 3 examples from the quarter of how NIKE is driving a more elevated and premium member experience across the marketplace. 
First, we recently launched new wellness content and workouts featuring Megan Thee Stallion in our Nike Training Club app. Megan's content drove record high engagement, drawing 2x increase in daily active users in NTC, and her curated looks saw more than double the demand compared to any other product content viewed during that same time period. 
Second, ahead of Singles Day in Greater China, we activated a new member experience on Tmall and improved the onboarding journey. As a result, the NIKE flagship store on Tmall was the #1 brand for new member recruitment across sport, driving a 20-point increase in member demand penetration this year. 
And third, just last month, we announced a partnership with one of our strategic retail partners, DICK'S Sporting Goods, who shares our vision for the future of retail, specifically, shopping and experiences that are amplified by digital and personal to each consumer's journey. This new partnership allows shoppers to link their NIKE member account and their DSG account together to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences. 
Recently, I had an opportunity to visit one of DSG's newest concepts, the House of Sport Door in Rochester, New York. I must say I was blown away at the store's unique service model, interactive sport experience and enhanced showcasing of product, which creates a true destination for consumers and will alter future expectations at retail. 
Our partnership with DSG is a new model of how brands and retailers work together, delivering product experience and connection service to delight consumers at scale. 
We're fulfilling our vision that through connected member experiences and inventory, powered by connected data and technology, we can provide consumers with greater access to the very best of NIKE with more speed, convenience and connection to our brand and to sport than ever before. And as we look forward, there is even more opportunity to connect consumers with NIKE across digital platforms that integrate sport, innovation, culture and commerce. 
For example, we recently opened a new space in our New York digital studio to produce the weekly SNKRS LIVE streams that are driving industry-leading engagement metrics. Weekly content includes launch previews in our SNKRS LIVE heating up show and a new Jordan franchise presented through the lens of female Jordan fans called J-Walking. 
Our stories go deep and engage a 2-way interaction with the community. And as a result, our consumer engagement is 3x the industry average for live streams. 
And speaking of SNKRS and Jordan, the first set of invitations for the AJ11 Cool Grey was sent to the largest female-focused group yet and sold out in the first hour. The group was selected utilizing our new Dedication Score, designed to reward member groups with high product affinity. We continue to see Exclusive Access serve as a defining marketing mechanism to connect with consumers. 
And in Q2, we also launched the 3D immersive world of NIKELAND on Roblox. NIKE is meeting young athletes wherever they are, encouraging them to let their imaginations run wild, and rewarding real-world movement through new virtual experiences. 
And just last week, we welcomed RTFKT to the NIKE, Inc. family. The NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands have always thrived at the intersection of sport, creativity, innovation and culture. The RTFKT acquisition allows us to extend this reach to serve and delight consumers and creators in both the physical and virtual worlds. We'll invest in a very talented RTFKT team, creator community and cutting-edge innovation to deliver next-generation experiences that involve the RTFKT and NIKE Inc. brands. 
Today, we're stronger than we were before the pandemic, and I couldn't be more excited by the opportunity ahead of us. Our results this quarter are evidence that our strategy is working. 
And as we close out 2021, I want to take a moment to personally thank our 75,000 global NIKE Inc. teammates for everything they've done this year. Through all we've navigated, this team has worked together with creativity and resilience to serve our consumers and serve our communities. This team is the greatest collection of talent in the world, and I want to sincerely thank them. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt."

As you've heard us say before, NIKE is a growth company with boundless potential. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy is transforming our operating model by driving deeper and more direct connections with consumers through digital. Our teams continue to navigate through unprecedented levels of volatility with flexibility, agility and grace, leveraging the operational playbook we created at the onset of the pandemic to stay focused on what matters most. 
We have embraced new ways of working, elevated experienced players into new leadership roles, reorganized the company to create even deeper focus on the consumer and developed new capabilities to serve consumers directly with speed and at scale. 
NIKE's second quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we established 90 days ago, fueled by continued brand momentum, the strength of our product franchises with extraordinary levels of full price realization and strong season-to-date holiday sales, offset by lower levels of available inventory supply relative to marketplace demand. 
As John mentioned, we had an incredible Black Friday week, with NIKE Direct in North America and EMEA, increasing over 20% versus the prior year, on top of last year's meaningful gains. 
To accomplish this, I'm particularly proud of the work by our supply chain teams. In late October, I was able to visit our North America distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi, to review our expanding digital fulfillment capabilities and holiday readiness plans. Our teams are executing those plans with precision, optimizing available inventory to meet demand with improved service levels and lowering carbon impact, all enabled through technology and automation. 
Staying on the topic of supply chain a little longer, factory reopening in Vietnam is on plan. Nearly all impacted factories began reopening in October. As of today, all factories are operational, and employee attendance rates have improved, with weekly footwear and apparel production now at roughly 80% of pre-closure volumes. In total, Vietnam factory closures caused us to cancel production of roughly 130 million units due to 3 months of lost production volume and several months to ramp back to full production. 
Compared to 90 days ago, we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal '23. 
Turning to our digital business. NIKE's digital growth is outperforming comparisons and being fueled by our member-centric focus. NIKE Digital grew 11% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, setting the pace for the industry. NIKE Digital is now 25% of total NIKE brand revenue, up 3 points versus the prior year and more than double the digital mix in fiscal '19. 
Enhanced onboarding experiences are attracting millions of new members into the top of the funnel, and we are focused heavily on member engagement and buying. Member engagement grew 27%, and repeat buyers grew 50% versus last year, driving overall higher AUR, AOV and member buying frequency. 40% of total digital demand this year is coming from our mobile apps, highlighting the strength of our digital platform. 
We now have over 79 million engaged members across our NIKE ecosystem. And as NIKE's digital ecosystem continues to grow, we are beginning to see the compounding benefits of scale from brand awareness and consumer connection to data-informed personalization and inventory utilization to loyalty. 
This quarter, we held our first globally coordinated Member Days event, setting records in member engagement. From member-exclusive product offerings to our first live-streamed member events from our Nike Town London and Passeig de Gracia Store in Barcelona, we created a distinct member experience and set a record for weekly active users on the Nike app in North America. 
Now moving to one final topic. Connecting with today's consumers means serving them with the product they want, when and where they want it. Consumers want a premium, seamless and personalized experience with minimal friction across their journey to explore, engage, connect and purchase products from the brands they love. 
As we've discussed before, NIKE is focused on creating One Nike Marketplace that elevates the brand by creating direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for the NIKE member. 
Over the past 4 years, North America has reduced the number of wholesale accounts by roughly 50%, while delivering strong growth and recapturing consumer demand through NIKE Direct and our strategic wholesale partners, leading the way for NIKE. 
In the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% versus the prior year, pushing NIKE Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing NIKE Direct to 48% of total. In order to enable this growth and drive the shift in marketplace composition, we have accelerated investment to evolve our distribution network and scale a digital-first supply chain, leveraging advanced analytics, automation and technology. We have opened 2 new regional service centers on both coasts, which are able to deliver more units to consumers with shorter delivery times. We also enabled ship-from-store capabilities across our store fleet, all leveraging advanced analytics from our Celect acquisition. 
On automation, we've added more than 1,000 robots in our distribution centers to handle the digital growth. In our digital distribution center in Memphis, robots handled more than 10 million units that would have otherwise required manual labor. 
We continue to scale O2O consumer services across our store fleet, including buy online, pick up in store and digital order returns in store. Volumes are relatively small today, but we have significant opportunity to scale. We've also established new fulfillment models with key strategic partners to create inventory visibility across the marketplace and optimize full-price digital demand. When we do this right, the consumer wins. 
The progress being made to create One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America's revenue growth and gross margin expansion for yet another quarter, illustrating how consumer-direct acceleration will fuel NIKE's growth and profitability towards the fiscal '25 outlook we shared in June. 
Now let me turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, led by 8% growth in NIKE Direct offset by a 6% decline in wholesale due to optimization of available inventory supply. 
NIKE Digital grew 11% and NIKE-owned stores grew 4% with significant improvements in traffic and higher conversion rates. 
Gross margin increased 280 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins due to lower markdowns, higher full price mix and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs. 
SG&A grew 15% versus the prior year, primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns, digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand, strategic technology investments and wage-related expenses. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.9% compared to 14.1% for the same period last year. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix and the effects of stock-based compensation. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.83, up 6% versus the prior year. 
Before we move into operating segment results, I want to recall a few points I made last quarter regarding the impact of Vietnam factory closures on the short-term performance of each of our geographies, beginning in the second quarter. North America and EMEA finished the first quarter with high levels of in-transit inventory, resulting in prior season supply that was arriving late due to longer transit times, which could be sold in the second quarter. We saw that in our Q2 results. 
However, Greater China and APLA, located closer to our sourcing base with shorter standard transit times, experienced a decline in units sold in the second quarter due to lost production and lower available inventory supply. We also saw that reflected in our Q2 results. With that in mind, let's review the operating segments. 
In North America, Q2 revenue grew 12% and EBIT grew 21%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong, with season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market growing double digits, energized by the continued momentum from the return to sport and the beginning of an outstanding holiday season. 
Performance sport dimensions delivered strong double-digit retail sales growth, led by running, fitness and basketball, on lower levels of sell-in due to available inventory supply. Women's retail sales grew high double digits, more than twice the rate of men's, with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. 
NIKE Direct had an outstanding quarter, growing 30% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, Digital maintained its momentum, growing 40% and setting holiday records on Black Friday week. NIKE-owned stores also delivered strong double-digit growth, with traffic trending towards pre-pandemic levels, and strong increases in AUR due to lower closeout inventory levels and significant year-over-year improvements in markdown rates and promotions. 
Despite strong retail sales momentum in the wholesale channel, revenue declined 1% as marketplace inventory levels remain lean and Vietnam factory closures and longer transit times disrupt the flow of inventory supply to meet marketplace demand. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 22% on a reported basis. Season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew double digits, with strong growth across all consumer segments. The region was energized by the start of the global football season and the Champions League tournament across the continent. NIKE players continue to dominate on the pitch with the Mercurial boot being the lead score in a number of European professional leagues. We saw a strong consumer response for the Mercurial boot and launch of the Champions League third kit. 
Wholesale revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we comped prior year market closures. NIKE Direct also grew 6%, led by double-digit growth in NIKE-owned stores, as we comp prior year store closures with traffic improvement due to tourism picking up and back-to-school holidays. 
NIKE Digital was down 1% as we compare to extraordinary levels of off-price sales in the prior year as the geography-leveraged digital in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory. This quarter, our full price digital business grew over 20%, resulting in a 30-point improvement in full price sales mix, double-digit growth in AUR and improvement in markdown rates and promotions. This contributed to strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and return on sales profitability. 
In Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 24% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 36% on a reported basis. However, season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market have trended more favorably. 
Results for this quarter were as expected, as we navigated lower full-price product supply due to the Vietnam factory closures. We saw disproportionate impacts to our wholesale revenue, which declined 27% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct declined 21% with declines in both digital and physical retail channels. 
COVID-related lockdowns continue to drive volatility in retail traffic. However, we did see traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter. Digital declined 27%, partially impacted by delay in product launch timing on SNKRS. 
Over the 11.11 consumer moment, we drove stronger digital performance with significant member acquisition and higher AOV through better engagement with consumers. 
While challenging, we continue to leverage our operational playbook and remain optimistic about the longer term in Greater China. This quarter, we extended our Joy of Sport brand campaign, utilizing local influencers, Olympians and other athletes that are part of NIKE's leading sports marketing portfolio in Greater China. The Jordan brand added to the energy by announcing their first female athlete signing in Asia with basketball player Yang Shu Yu. To support this activity and normalize our marketing investment levels, we increased our investment in demand creation in the second quarter by more than 40% versus the prior year. 
Our local team remains focused on creating distinctive and authentic connections with Chinese consumers. We celebrated the 40th anniversary of NIKE's operations in China by using the Express Lane to reintroduce the original NAI-KE collection, with robust storytelling on the history and heritage of these iconic products. During our first launch, all products sold through in the first hour. We will continue to expand the Express Lane to bring unique localized offerings to the consumer, leveraging our most popular global product franchises to drive uniquely NIKE energy in the marketplace. 
We see encouraging signs in Greater China. And while inventory supply has been a major disruption in the marketplace, we continue to expect fiscal '22 to be a year of recovery. Having said that, we expect to see sequential improvement from here, beginning in the third quarter. 
Now moving to APLA. Q2 revenue declined 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 8% on a reported basis. Double-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis in SOCO was offset by declines in Asia Pacific territories, which faced a greater impact from Vietnam factory closures as well as the business model shift in Brazil. Season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew versus the prior year, despite supply disruptions and door closures in SEA&I and Pacific. NIKE Direct grew 6%, led by NIKE Digital growth of 25%. 
Our teams maximized market moments, with all territories delivering successful Member Days and locally relevant activations, including Singles Day in Southeast Asia, Buen Fin in Mexico and Cyber Week in Japan. 
Mexico's digital business more than doubled as we enabled the localized assortment and fulfillment capabilities through the Nike App. 
Finally, APLA continues to leverage the Express Lane, their digital ecosystem and global partnerships to create locally relevant product and meaningful engagement with consumers around the world. Consumers in APLA are highly connected, and our team continues to innovate on digital experiences that are locally relevant. 
The Dia de Los Muertos footwear pack saw a 100% sell-through, and this story was extended to the world through our new partnership with Roblox. 
Now let's turn to our financial outlook. As we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic, it is becoming even more challenging to compare quarters and fiscal years due to multiple waves of COVID-related disruption at different times across the consumer marketplace and now supply chain. 
We expect the operating environment to remain volatile as COVID variants continue to cause disruption to business operations. Our fiscal '22 financial outlook reflects inventory supply significantly lagging consumer demand across NIKE's portfolio of brands. 
However, NIKE's long-term market opportunity is larger than ever. And so we remain focused on what we can control in the short term and on where we are heading through our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy and on what is required to deliver on our fiscal '25 financial outlook. 
Specifically for fiscal '22, we continue to expect revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year, in line with guidance from 90 days ago. For Q3, we expect revenue to grow low single digits versus the prior year due to the ongoing impacts from lost production from COVID-related disruptions in Vietnam. 
We are raising our gross margin guidance to expand 150 basis points versus the prior year. We expect to continue benefiting from exceptional demand against the backdrop of lean marketplace inventory. Full price realization will remain above our long-term target with lower channel markdowns. However, we expect product costs to rise in the second half due to higher macro input costs. We're also planning for supply chain costs for the full year to increase relative to our estimates 90 days ago, with a greater impact in the second half. Last, we now expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis point tailwind versus the prior year. 
We continue to expect SG&A to grow mid- to high teens for the full year as demand creation spend normalizes, and we continue to invest in the capabilities to support our consumer-led digital transformation. We now expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the full year. 
Consumer Direct Acceleration is driving our business forward, and it is transforming our financial model. We continue to prove that we can manage through the uncertainty and volatility in the current operating environment. But we are doing more than just managing through. 
We are building NIKE for the future with deeper consumer connections, a pipeline of product innovation to serve the needs of the modern athlete and new operational capabilities required to serve consumers directly and digitally at scale. We have a clear vision of our brand's long-term future, and so we remain focused on what is required to win over the long term. 
With that, let's open up the call for questions."

As I mentioned, our factories are back operational at this point in time, and I referenced an 80% number across footwear and apparel. It actually skews a little lower in footwear and a little higher in apparel. But as we watch employee attendance rates each week, we continue to grow increasingly confident in the guidance that we provided last quarter. 
So last quarter, we said our factories would resume production on October 1, and we said it would take us several months to get back to weekly production capacity, consistent with where we were prior to the factory closures. We're on that plan. 
So as we look at our guidance for the balance of the year, it reflects those continued assumptions. And relative to where we were 90 days ago, we're increasingly confident that inventory supply will normalize and that we'll be in a position to meet the incredible demand that we're seeing across the marketplace."

I'm just going to repeat what I said last quarter and the quarter before, which is NIKE always has, and we always will, take a long-term view in China, right? We've been there for 40 years. Phil was in there very early. We have built up a very strong brand connection with the consumer in China. And we're going to continue to invest to lead in China. And so we're investing behind the various things that brought us to where we are today. 
First and foremost, we have a great local team. Angela Dong and her team are helping us navigate and shepherd through the current environment. Product innovations, at the top of our list, the most innovative product in the world that we consistently produce increasingly tailored to the Chinese consumer through our Express Lane. And Matt talked a little bit about that, and that more and more of what we do in China is tailored to that China consumer. 
Same thing on storytelling. Storytelling that's centered on local athletes and the local consumer. We mentioned the signing of the most recent Jordan sports marketing elite athlete and the live streaming. We're connecting with that local Chinese consumer on their terms. 
And then we continue to be responsible citizens. We've always invested to grow sport in China. We are continuing to do that. We care and are investing behind sustainability. And so the same fundamentals that have always been there, we believe, are the right fundamentals going forward. 
This quarter, as Matt said, the results were in line with what we expected, with all the supply shortages and other dimensions. And what I look at is when we are present and active with the consumer in China, how they're responding. We saw some very encouraging things. 
We were very active around Singles Day. Right? We mentioned 90 live streams in the month prior with over 70 million viewers. That led to 13 million new members. And NIKE, once again being #1 on the Tmall during that period in China. 
And so we're focusing on the long term. We're getting a little bit better each quarter, and we're going to continue on that path, working closely with our team there."

Omar, I just got to say I am so proud of how our team has navigated through the last 6 to 24 months. It's been an ongoing series, as you know, of start/stop, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of change. And our team has responded with resilience, with creativity, and with a lot of innovation. 
And I got to be honest, in hindsight, many of the changes that have been made accelerated progress that otherwise would have happened. And so we're actually in a stronger position today. I think we've actually benefited because of our team's efforts and demonstrated ability to respond even in a work-from-home environment. 
Now that said, we do believe over time that with innovation and a strong brand, we want to go to a hybrid model. As you know, in the United States, we have mandated vaccines and have a very high response rate to that. So we're ready to come back in a hybrid work environment when that's safe, and we prioritize that, safety of our employees.

As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the biggest drivers of gross margin expansion this quarter, and frankly, the biggest driver relative to what we had guided 90 days ago was the level of full price realization and lower markdown rates versus what we had anticipated for a holiday season. And so we were surprised by it. And it just is reflective of the strength of the brand and the connections that we've got with consumers. 
As we look to the balance of the year, we are expecting full-price realization to stay high and above, especially in North America and EMEA, that goal that we provided at Investor Day a couple of years ago, and we expect discount rates to remain low. 
The impact, as you look at sequential quarters, is that we started to see improvements in markdown rates in the second half of last year in those 2 geographies in particular. And so the year-over-year impact from tighter supply, higher full price realization and lower markdowns has a lesser of an impact in the second quarter. 
What I'd say longer term is we continue to evaluate full-price realization and the goals that we've set. And while we haven't changed them, we are above in a couple of markets. As inventory supply normalizes, we would expect that to come back down to where our goals are at, but we're also operating a far more agile operating model at this point in time and so -- led by NIKE Direct. 
And so we'll continue to evaluate it especially as it pertains to the long-term margin outlook we provided. We still are confident in that high 40s gross margin outlook through fiscal '25. But I think the effects that we're seeing in this first year with tightened supply may just change the trajectory of how we get there."

Let me just tell you the foundation with which I say it. Number one, our brand tracking tells us that our brand is still the #1 cool and favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, and it's strengthening and strengthening against our historical competitors. In fact, the only people that are coming close are technology companies. And so that continues to be one evidence. 
But I think even more fundamentally and longer term is the foundation of having a direct connection with the consumer. We are in an era where that is the liquid gold for any brand is to have a direct connection with the consumer so that you can understand that consumer, you can engage that consumer and then you can serve them in a personalized way. And if you have a leadership position, you have more information with which to do all that, more data, more information. 
And so our digital penetration is at an all-time high. Matt mentioned at 25%. Our Direct Digital and mono brand penetrations at an all-time high, that gives us that direct connection. And frankly, the partnerships like DICK'S allows us to have that direct connection, whether it's direct or with a wholesale partner, and that allows us to serve that consumer in a more personalized, engaging and sustainable way. And we believe that is going to be one of the key indicators of future success. And not every brand in our industry or other industries is to be able to have that direct connection with consumers. And so that's the best leading indicator. And that's why we're putting so much focus on our full consumer funnel, bringing new members into the top of the funnel, engaging the mid-funnel and then obviously, translating that into strong and deep relationships. 
And so when you compare geographies, we're in this weird period where you got sort of numerator/denominator issues, right? Obviously, North America results were really strong this quarter. We had the supply and our team did a great job executing. 
In EMEA, for instance, the digital results reflected last year when we were sort of liquidating a lot of inventory when COVID just occurred. But I look at our full-price digital penetration, it was quite strong. So the quarter-to-quarter growth rates get a little bit hard to interpret because of supply issues because of the previous years we're lapping store closures or -- but I would say we feel very good and very confident about being stronger in each of our regions."

Matt, let me start with the comment, your improved confidence on the supply chain versus 90 days ago, confidence in inventory getting back to more normal flows in fiscal '23. Is that what it takes for the China market to get back to the kind of the long-term algorithm with sustained double-digit growth that you spoke about on the fourth quarter call?"

And we've been -- we've talked about that both earlier today and last quarter. 
We also had to navigate through local measures that were put in place to reduce the spread of COVID. And what I mean by that is that 25% of our partner retail stores were impacted in the quarter in some way as a result of local mandates to affect operations, and 50% of our factory stores in Greater China were equal -- were similarly impacted. And so that was -- those were clearly the 2 biggest drivers that impacted our performance this quarter. 
I mentioned SNKRS and the comparison challenges due to the delay of launch. But we've actually seen digital sequentially improving throughout the quarter. And so we're increasingly optimistic given our 11.11 performance in the way that we're sequentially improving. And as supply normalizes, as I referenced, we expect to see sequential improvement from these 2Q results. And as we restart our marketing activity and drive those connections with consumers, some of these signals that we're seeing, these encouraging signs that we see give us a lot of confidence that our trajectory is going to improve from this quarter."
