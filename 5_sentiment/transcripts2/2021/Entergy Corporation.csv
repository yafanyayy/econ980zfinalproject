Before I turn to my remarks, I would like to give you an update on the winter storms we experienced last week. Severe weather conditions affected most of the country, including our service area. In order to ba",2319,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn to my remarks, I would like to give you an update on the winter storms we experienced last week. Severe weather conditions affected most of the country, including our service area. In order to balance the system, MISO directed us to conduct rolling power outages. Our system is back to normal operations. Our thoughts are with all of our customers and communities who were impacted by the weather. Our employees once again demonstrated their dedication by working around the clock in difficult conditions to quickly restore service where needed. As always, I am grateful and humbled by their commitment. 
We're still working through our numbers, but our preliminary assessment of the cost is approximately $125 million to $140 million associated with mobilizing crews and restoring power and approximately $400 million of incremental fuel costs. We have fuel recovery mechanisms in all of our jurisdictions, and we will work with our regulators to recover these costs in a manner that mitigates the impact on customer bills. 
I will now turn to our discussion on 2020. Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. Our adjusted earnings per share is $5.66. That's in the top half of our guidance range. We achieved these results by overcoming revenue challenges with our flexible spending program. We just set a goal to reduce 2020 cost by $100 million, and we exceeded that target by approximately 50%. 
Underlying our strong performance was the foundation that we have built over the last several years. We've become a resilient organization prepared to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders even in extraordinary times. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier utility. 
Challenges are a natural part of doing business. No company is immune, and Entergy is no exception. As 2020 proved, the test of sustainability is less about challenges and more about how we are able to achieve our goals regardless of the circumstances. Because of this solid foundation and our proven track record, we are confident in our continued success in 2021 and beyond. As such, we are initiating 2021 guidance and affirming our longer-term outlooks, all in line with what we shared at Analyst Day last September. 
In 2020, we brought online 4 large generation resources that are cleaner and more efficient than our older assets, providing customer savings and environmental benefits that will help us meet our sustainability commitments. These assets also give us dispatch flexibility that is important for system reliability. 
Renewable energy is also a key part of our strategy to achieve our sustainability goals. Our clean energy efforts have escalated over the past few years. We now have more than 500 megawatts of renewable resources in operation. These resources come in many forms, small and large, owned and contracted. And some are innovative solutions like the New Orleans residential rooftop project, where we own the solar systems that are installed at low-income customers' homes. Those customers get a fixed credit on their bill, providing economic benefits to those who need it and renewable energy for all customers. 
We have approximately 450 megawatts of solar projects currently being installed. We have another 880 megawatts of solar resources either in regulatory review or RFPs, and we plan to solicit another 800 megawatts of solar this year. This is only the beginning, and we will continue to grow the number of renewable energy facilities across our region. 
Almost half of our capital was for distribution and utility support investments that are closest to the customer experience. A portion of these costs is for our advanced meter project. We have now completed the installation of 70% of the 3 million advanced meters we are deploying across our service area. This is an exciting milestone as we enter the final phase of our 3-year journey. Advanced meters help our customers better manage their energy usage and bills, and it lays the foundation for new technological capabilities over time. 
With billions of real-time data points available, we'll be able to gain new insights that will drive fundamental change in the way we serve our customers while consuming the least amount of energy resources. We invested $800 million in our transmission infrastructure excluding storms. Our transmission investments benefit our system and our customers as they reduce congestion, strengthen service reliability, enhance system efficiency and resiliency and support economic development in our jurisdictions by enabling service to new customers. 
We completed several important projects, some of which proved critical during the active storm season. These new structures built to modern standards, which stood to record winds from Hurricane Laura and were critical to restoring power following that storm. These projects are all part of our plan to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and provide a higher level of service to our customers. 
In 2020, we continued to work collaboratively with our regulators for the benefit of customers. In the face of difficult times due to COVID-19, we collaborated to find solutions. Early on, we suspended disconnects and worked to set up payment plans for customers who couldn't pay their bills. In all our jurisdictions, we received accounting orders to deferred costs associated with COVID-19, including bad debt expense from accounts that we don't expect to collect as a result of the pandemic. We also work with our commissions on rate recovery mechanisms that give us the opportunity to recover costs that are benefiting our customers. 
Public Utility Commission of Texas finalized the new generation rider, which provides for full and timely recovery of capital costs associated with new generation. More timely recovery helps us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensures that the communities we serve remain economically competitive. The Texas commission approved the use of this rider earlier this year for recovery of the Montgomery County Power Station. The City Council of New Orleans approved the unanimous settlement that resolved Entergy New Orleans rate case and FRP filing. We will make the first of 3 annual FRP filings later this year. 
We also had annual FRP rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. We plan to submit filings in Louisiana and Texas in the first quarter of this year and in New Orleans in the second quarter to request recovery of 2020 storm costs. As we have done in the past, we will seek to securitize these costs. With current low interest rates, this will result in significantly lower cost to customers as compared to typical recovery. Louisiana's and Arkansas's FRPs expire with the 2020 filings, and we've requested renewal of both. Discussions are ongoing, and we will provide updates as we get them. 
In spite of the positive outcomes in 2020, the Arkansas commission's order for our 2021 FRP rate change fell short of our expectations. We believe the order incorrectly applies the law and results in an unreasonable outcome. We requested a rehearing on the commission's order, and we expect to receive their decision on our request and the FRP extension by March 15. You should note that our guidance and outlooks today reflect the commission's December order and extension of the FRP. 
Our leadership in sustainability and environmental stewardship has been a long-standing hallmark of who we are and has led to measurable, undeniable results. For the past 2 decades, our emissions rate has been well below the sector average. Our utility CO2 emissions rate has decreased nearly 40% since 2000. And today, we operate one of the cleanest large-scale power generation fleets in the nation. Our fleet is one of the cleanest as we have not only set meaningful reduction targets, but we continue to exceed them. 
The most recent example is our Environment 2020 goal, where we committed to maintain carbon dioxide emissions through 2020 at 20% below year 2000 levels. Our actual 2020 emissions were 27% below 2000 levels, beating our reduction goal by 33%. 
Looking ahead, our business plan supports our 2030 commitment to reduce our utility carbon emissions rate by 50% below year 2000 levels. Achieving this objective calls for continued transformation of our portfolio. To that end, by 2030, we anticipate that our generation portfolio will include at least 5 gigawatts of renewables, with potential for more. During that time frame, we also plan to deactivate approximately 4 gigawatts of legacy gas, along with the remainder of our coal assets. Going forward, we will not build any large-scale generation that isn't hydrogen-capable. 
As we transform our portfolio, we will work with our regulators to do so within a framework that balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship while enriching the economies of the communities we serve. To support our longer-term net zero goal, we're exploring emerging technologies through a partnership with Mitsubishi Power. We will develop innovative solutions that include large-scale battery storage, carbon capture and sequestration and hydrogen-based strategies. While we are not relying on hydrogen to meet our 2030 commitment, we believe it will be a part of creating a carbon-free future. 
Hydrogen is an important technology that will allow utilities to adopt much greater levels of renewables to meet growing sustainability needs. Hydrogen storage, transportation and utilization attributes will allow us to leverage today's pipeline and generation technologies in a manner that supports a highly reliable and fuel-diverse electric grid. 
In the Gulf South, we have a distinct locational advantage, and we are uniquely positioned given the existing hydrogen infrastructure in Texas and Louisiana. Existing infrastructure today in our service territory includes more than 3.5 billion cubic feet of hydrogen capacity; 2 of the 3 hydrogen salt caverns operating in the United States; and more than 1,100 miles of hydrogen pipelines, which is 60% of the United States infrastructure. In addition, 2 of the largest hydrogen producers in the world are our customers. 
We also have more than 860 miles of CO2 pipelines in our service area, which would facilitate carbon capture and sequestration. These are just a few of the advantages for our service area, which presents us with unique opportunities. 
To advance our work on hydrogen, we are working on a few projects that I'd like to share. Orange County Power Station was selected in Entergy Texas' request for proposals. That facility will have the capability upon commercial operation to utilize up to 30% hydrogen. Longer term, the turbines can be configured to operate on up to 100% hydrogen at modest incremental cost. The facility is conveniently located near existing hydrogen pipeline infrastructure that can be connected to the plant to utilize hydrogen when feasible and economic. We own a storage facility with 3 caverns. We are evaluating converting one of these caverns to hydrogen. We are taking advantage of the existing hydrogen pipeline infrastructure in the Texas industrial corridor near the Orange County Power Station, and we are developing a 4-phase plan to support access to hydrogen fuel across our fleet of hydrogen-capable plants. 
We are also in the very early stages of developing a green hydrogen demonstration plant, Montgomery County Hydrogen Innovation Center. This project will teach us important lessons about electrolysis operations and ultimately lay the groundwork for future full-scale projects. We're excited about these projects in our collaboration with Mitsubishi as we lead our industry to make hydrogen a reality that will create green jobs in the Gulf South region. We'll provide updates on these initiatives as we have new developments. 
Being the premier utility means doing our part to create a more sustainable future for our customers, our communities and the world, the goal we continuously strive for in everything we do. In 2020, we were once again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 19 years in a row, and we are very proud of this recognition as DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We earned perfect scores in the areas of climate strategy, water-related risks, materiality, environmental reporting, social reporting and policy influence. 
This past year, our employees demonstrated once again why Entergy is best in class in storm response. During a storm season, unlike any other in our history, our commitment to health, safety and preparedness is one of our proudest achievements. Our teams worked around the clock to safely restore service, to rebuild infrastructure and to help our communities recover while following virus prevention protocols. 
For our employees' extraordinary efforts, we received broad support from local, state and federal officials. We also received 5 emergency response awards from EEI. This marks the 23rd consecutive year EEI has recognized Entergy employees for their emergency response. 
2020 was another successful year for our company. Everything we accomplished gives me confidence in our ability to meet our goals and commitments going forward. We've proven that we are a resilient company prepared to respond to adversity and deliver on our mission to create sustainable value for our stakeholders. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier utility. 
Despite obstacles imposed by the pandemic, mild weather and storms, our employees found ways to connect, innovate, drive growth and build toward the future, all while meeting our financial commitments. The fundamentals of our company are strong, and the drivers that uniquely position us to be the premier utility remain firmly in place. We consistently meet or exceed our guidance expectations. We have line of sight on 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth. And by the end of the year, we expect the same for our dividend growth rate subject to Board approval. 
And as we mature in our continuous improvement efforts, we aspire to permanently reduce O&M costs and redeploy those resources for the benefit of our stakeholders. I am as excited as ever about our future. 
I will now turn the call over to Drew to review our financial performance."

Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for 2020. As Leo mentioned, we successfully managed lower revenues by lowering our O&M expense by approximately $150 million, which exceeded our $100 million cost-reduction target for the year. Our results today are a validation of the strong, resilient company we are. As a result, we are confident in our continued success going forward and are initiating our guidance and affirming our longer-term outlooks. 
I'll begin with a review of results for the full year and then provide an overview of guidance for 2021. Starting on Slide 6. Entergy adjusted EPS for 2020 was $5.66, $0.26 higher than 2019 and the top half of our guidance range. 
Moving to Slide 7. There were many drivers that are straightforward and laid out in the release, but the key area of focus for us in 2020 was O&M. We offset the negative impact of storms, COVID-19 and unfavorable weather with approximately $150 million of cost reductions. And to do this, we identified a number of cost-cutting measures early in the year and deliberately executed on our plan. 
Slide 8 lists some of the actions taken. We are proud of what we've accomplished, yet we are not surprised. Our employees have built the culture, processes and resources to successfully deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders, even during extraordinary times, and that's been important this year more than ever. Our results further strengthen our confidence in our success going forward as we affirm our earnings expectations from '21 through '23. 
The results for EWC summarized on Slide 9 are generally in line with our expectations, and we continue to make good progress on our exit of that business. 
Full year operating cash flow, shown on Slide 10, was approximately $2.7 billion. As you would expect, storm costs were a large driver as were lower collections due to COVID-19. Decreased collections for fuel and purchased power costs and unfavorable weather also affected the metric. Lower unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers partly offset the decrease. 
Our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 11. Our parent debt to total debt is 21.6%, and our FFO to debt is 10.3%. As we mentioned last quarter, our FFO to debt is temporarily lower in part due to the financial impact from the storms. We expect the metric to return to target levels as we receive storm securitization proceeds next year. As you know, we have strong precedence for storm cost recovery, and we have planned to submit initial filings over the next few weeks. We'll also pursue off-balance sheet treatment in Louisiana and Texas. 
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile and is supporting credit targets, including at or above 15% for FFO to debt next year and below 25% for parent debt to total debt. 
Moving to Slide 12. With the resiliency we've demonstrated in 2020, we are confident in our continued success in 2021 and beyond. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range is $5.80 to $6.10. And our current plan puts us firmly at the $5.95 midpoint. This and our 2022 and 2023 outlook ranges remain the same as the outlook we presented at Analyst Day. We continue to target a 5% to 7% annual growth rate for adjusting -- for adjusted earnings per share. We also expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth rate starting in the fourth quarter of this year subject to final Board approval. 
On Slide 11 -- excuse me, on Slide 13, I'm going backwards, we've outlined a few of the key drivers for 2021 earnings growth. We also include more detailed assumptions in the appendix of the webcast presentation. Beginning with the top line of full year of 2020 rate activity, following significant investments to benefit customers will contribute to 2021's growth. We will also make annual FRP filings during the year. 
We project utility O&M a little under $2.7 billion, in line with our disclosures from Analyst Day. Depreciation expense is expected to increase, and net interest is expected to decrease due to lower AFUDC as new plants came online in 2020. We also anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be higher. 
Our guidance and outlooks reflect the December APSC order in Arkansas and assume an FRP extension in both Arkansas and Louisiana. In Arkansas, we are reprioritizing our O&M and capital investments to closely align with the ordered recovery structure. To the extent the order is reversed, we will plan to readjust our O&M and capital to deliver the customer benefits that those investments would produce. 
While we continue to monitor risks, we have already identified flexible spending levers in the event needed. And we are also exploring permanent upside opportunities through solar investments and further continuous improvement. 
As Leo mentioned, 2020 was a strong year for our company. We exceeded our $100 million cost-reduction target and delivered on our commitments to each of our 4 key stakeholders in the midst of unprecedented times. Looking ahead, the fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong. Our guidance and outlooks remain the same as we presented at Analyst Day and provide clear line of sight to the 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth rate. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. And our solid strategic, operational and financial plans will upgrade the service level that we provide to our customers. 
Our proven and disciplined flexible spending program helps us adapt to financial headwinds or tailwinds so we can meet our financial commitments. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate. We have significant opportunities ahead, and we are well positioned to be the premier utility. 
Before turning the call over to Q&A, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank David Borde for his great work as Vice President of Investor Relations. He's built solid relationships with all of you, and the good news is he will not go far. He will work with Rod to help bring our vision of the future utility to life. And for the next few weeks, we will reach out to many of you to introduce Bill Abler, who is taking over leadership of the Investor Relations team. Bill has a strong commercial background in both commodities and utilities, and he will be an excellent representative for us with you. And as you know, both David and Bill are backed by a very strong team with disciplined processes, so you should not expect any change in the level of service you will see from us there. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

That's the primary thing that we are taking action to adjust with. 
In terms of potential upside, as I also said in my remarks, to the extent that we're able to get the order reversed, we would anticipate putting most, if not all, it depends on what the order would say, back into our capital plan so that our customers could benefit from the capital and O&M that we are planning to deploy in Arkansas.

Our other considerations are execution and distraction from the things that we are doing to further create value for our stakeholders already underway. 
And the second one is probably the one that makes it perhaps a little bit challenging for us in the sense of trying to do that for equity raises because we would likely require approval from regulatory commissions in order to do any sort of M&A activity at the Opcos. And so while we might be able to find good value, if we were counting on that for an equity raise and we had to go through the regulatory process, that would create a lot of uncertainty in that equity rate. So it's probably not the best path for us. But certainly, if there is value-creation opportunity out there, then we would be looking at it."

And what we've experienced, obviously, we're still in the process of getting the lessons learned about the events that we saw last week. 
So we always -- I wouldn't say that it's inconsistent with the plans we have for resiliency. But certainly, every time we go through any kind of event, we will learn something that we will apply to the next events. So there are things we learned in Katrina that have really served us well for every event that occurred after that, both in terms of what we do to our system and how our capital shapes up, but also as well as our processes and our operations and our interactions with the industry, et cetera. 
So there will be lessons learned, and they will direct our activities, potentially differently. I wouldn't say that it's going to create an incremental capital spend or anything like that, potentially redirection of it. Now it could provide some incremental capital spend. If in working with our regulators, they determine -- we jointly determine that there are things that we need to do more quickly than we otherwise would have done. But I wouldn't say right now that there's some anticipation of a change in the size of the capital plan going forward because of these events might be a change in direction for some things just to prioritize differently. 
But everything is a learning experience, and we'll continue to do that. And as I said, the events last week, we're still unpacking everything there."

But this year, we've identified new ones that we would be able to use to manage this year, if needed. 
And we had continued on last year, after we said that we got to $100 million, looking for more in the event that we needed it. And it turns out, as you know, that we need all of it. 
There -- having said that, there were some things that were identified as potential continuous improvement elements and sort of fit into those other buckets, although they were relatively small, I would think, in the 20% range. And those are now accounted for in our outlooks as part of our O&M expectations. 
And there are other things that we are looking at. We are driving our continuous improvement efforts forward. Things like real estate optimization are in the spotlight for us as we think about how we manage our workforce of the future. And that's an easy one to consider as we go forward.

But they are aware of our point of view around the capital plan. We're not talking about specific puts and takes. That said, our point of view that we shared with you earlier about why we thought the FRP provided us the best opportunity to create sustainable value for customers has played out during the pendency of the FRP and why we feel so adamant about the propriety of the extension.

So -- and that incremental $87 million was recorded as a regulatory asset because we have orders in each of our jurisdictions that would allow us to recover those costs. 
The arrears is -- typically runs about the higher than the bad debt expense. And so that number is pretty consistent. We've seen it begin to level off, but we need to see where it goes with this latest round of storms and a little bit of backtracking on disconnects because of the storms. And we never did get off of disconnects in Arkansas or New Orleans. So those 2 jurisdictions are -- have continued on for a little bit longer. But that's kind of where we stand right now."

Severe weather conditions affected most of the country, including our service area. In order to balance the system, MISO directed us to conduct rolling power outages.
Our system is back to normal operations. Our thoughts are with all of our customers and communities who were impacted by the weather. Our employees once again demonstrated their dedication by working around the clock in difficult conditions to quickly restore service where needed. As always, I am grateful and humbled by their commitment.
We're still working through our numbers, but our preliminary assessment of the cost is approximately $125 million to $140 million associated with mobilizing crews and restoring power and approximately $400 million of incremental fuel costs. We have fuel recovery mechanisms in all of our jurisdictions, and we will work with our regulators to recover these costs in a manner that mitigates the impacts on customer bills.
I will now turn to our discussion on 2020. Today, we are reporting strong results for another successful year. Our adjusted earnings per share is $5.66. That's in the top half of our guidance range. We achieved these results by overcoming revenue challenges with our flexible spending program. We just set a goal to reduce 2020 cost by $100 million, and we exceeded that target by approximately 50%.
Underlying our strong performance was the foundation that we have built over the last several years. We've become a resilient organization prepared to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders even in extraordinary times. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier utility.
Challenges are a natural part of doing business. No company is immune, and Entergy is no exception. As 2020 proved, the test of sustainability is less about challenges and more about how we are able to achieve our goals regardless of the circumstances. Because of this solid foundation and our proven track record, we are confident in our continued success in 2021 and beyond. As such, we are initiating 2021 guidance and affirming our longer-term outlooks, all in line with what we shared at Analyst Day last September.
In 2020, we brought online 4 large generation resources that are cleaner and more efficient than our older assets, providing customer savings and environmental benefits that will help us meet our sustainability commitments. These assets also give us dispatch flexibility that is important for system reliability.
Renewable energy is also a key part of our strategy to achieve our sustainability goals. Our clean energy efforts have escalated over the past few years. We now have more than 500 megawatts of renewable resources in operation. These resources come in many forms, small and large, owned and contracted.
And some are innovative solutions like the New Orleans Residential Rooftop Project, where we own the solar systems that are installed at low-income customers' homes. Those customers get a fixed credit on their bill, providing economic benefits to those who need it and renewable energy for all customers.
We have approximately 450 megawatts of solar projects currently being installed. We have another 880 megawatts of solar resources either in regulatory review or RFPs, and we plan to solicit another 800 megawatts of solar this year. This is only the beginning, and we will continue to grow the number of renewable energy facilities across our region.
Almost half of our capital was for distribution and utility support investments that are closest to the customer experience. A portion of these costs is for our advanced meter project. We have now completed the installation of 70% of the 3 million advanced meters we are deploying across our service area. This is an exciting milestone as we enter the final phase of our 3-year journey. Advanced meters help our customers better manage their energy usage and bills, and it lays the foundation for new technological capabilities over time.
With billions of real-time data points available, we'll be able to gain new insights that will drive fundamental change in the way we serve our customers while consuming the least amount of energy resources. We invested $800 million in our transmission infrastructure excluding storms. Our transmission investments benefit our system and our customers as they reduce congestion, strengthen service reliability, enhance system efficiency and resiliency and support economic development in our jurisdictions by enabling service to new customers.
We completed several important projects, some of which proved critical during the active storm season. These new structures, built to modern standards, withstood the record winds from Hurricane Laura and were critical to restoring power following that storm. These projects are all part of our plan to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and provide a higher level of service to our customers.
In 2020, we continued to work collaboratively with our regulators for the benefit of customers. In the face of difficult times due to COVID-19, we collaborated to find solutions. Early on, we suspended disconnects and worked to set up payment plans for customers who couldn't pay their bills. In all our jurisdictions, we received accounting orders that deferred costs associated with COVID-19, including bad debt expense from accounts that we don't expect to collect as a result of the pandemic. We also work with our commissions on rate recovery mechanisms that give us the opportunity to recover costs that are benefiting our customers.
The Public Utility Commission of Texas finalized the new generation rider, which provides for full and timely recovery of capital costs associated with new generation. A more timely recovery helps us create value for our stakeholders in Texas and ensures that the communities we serve remain economically competitive. The Texas commission approved the use of this rider earlier this year for recovery of the Montgomery County Power Station.
The City Council of New Orleans approved the unanimous settlement that resolved Entergy New Orleans rate case and FRP filing. We will make the first of 3 annual FRP filings later this year. We also had annual FRP rate actions in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. We plan to submit filings in Louisiana and Texas in the first quarter of this year and in New Orleans in the second quarter to request recovery of 2020 storm costs.
As we have done in the past, we will seek to securitize these costs. With current low interest rates, this will result in significantly lower cost to customers as compared to typical recovery. Louisiana's and Arkansas' FRPs expire with the 2020 filings, and we've requested renewal of both. Discussions are ongoing, and we will provide updates as we get them.
In spite of the positive outcomes in 2020, the Arkansas commission's order for our 2021 FRP rate change fell short of our expectations. We believe the order incorrectly applies the law and results in an unreasonable outcome. We requested a rehearing on the commission's order, and we expect to receive their decision on our request and the FRP extension by March 15. You should note that our guidance and outlooks today reflect the commission's December order and extension of the FRP.
Our leadership in sustainability and environmental stewardship has been a long-standing hallmark of who we are and has led to measurable, undeniable results. For the past 2 decades, our emissions rate has been well below the sector average. Our utility CO2 emissions rate has decreased nearly 40% since 2000. And today, we operate one of the cleanest large-scale power generation fleets in the nation. Our fleet is one of the cleanest as we have not only set meaningful reduction targets, but we continue to exceed them.
The most recent example is our Environment 2020 goal, where we committed to maintain carbon dioxide emissions through 2020 at 20% below year 2000 levels. Our actual 2020 emissions were 27% below 2000 levels, beating our reduction goal by 33%.
Looking ahead, our business plan supports our 2030 commitment to reduce our utility carbon emissions rate by 50% below year 2000 levels. Achieving this objective calls for continued transformation of our portfolio. To that end, by 2030, we anticipate that our generation portfolio will include at least 5 gigawatts of renewables with potential for more. During that time frame, we also plan to deactivate approximately 4 gigawatts of legacy gas, along with the remainder of our coal assets. Going forward, we will not build any large-scale generation that isn't hydrogen-capable.
As we transform our portfolio, we will work with our regulators to do so within a framework that balances reliability, affordability and environmental stewardship while enriching the economies of the communities we serve. To support our longer-term net zero goal, we're exploring emerging technologies through a partnership with Mitsubishi Power.
We will develop innovative solutions that include large-scale battery storage, carbon capture and sequestration and hydrogen-based strategies. While we are not relying on hydrogen to meet our 2030 commitment, we believe it will be a part of creating a carbon-free future.
Hydrogen is an important technology that will allow utilities to adopt much greater levels of renewables to meet growing sustainability needs. Hydrogen storage, transportation and utilization attributes will allow us to leverage today's pipeline and generation technologies in a manner that supports a highly reliable and fuel-diverse electric grid.
In the Gulf South, we have a distinct locational advantage, and we are uniquely positioned given the existing hydrogen infrastructure in Texas and Louisiana. Existing infrastructure today in our service territory includes more than 3.5 billion cubic feet of hydrogen capacity; 2 of the 3 hydrogen salt caverns operating in the United States; and more than 1,100 miles of hydrogen pipelines, which is 60% of the United States infrastructure. In addition, 2 of the largest hydrogen producers in the world are our customers.
We also have more than 860 miles of CO2 pipelines in our service area, which would facilitate carbon capture and sequestration. These are just a few of the advantages for our service area, which presents us with unique opportunities.
To advance our work on hydrogen, we are working on a few projects that I'd like to share. Orange County Power Station was selected in Entergy Texas' request for proposals. That facility will have the capability upon commercial operation to utilize up to 30% hydrogen. Longer term, the turbines can be configured to operate on up to 100% hydrogen at modest incremental cost.
The facility is conveniently located near existing hydrogen pipeline infrastructure that can be connected to the plant to utilize hydrogen when feasible and economic. We own a storage facility with 3 caverns. We are evaluating converting one of these caverns to hydrogen. We are taking advantage of the existing hydrogen pipeline infrastructure in the Texas industrial corridor near the Orange County Power Station, and we are developing a 4-phase plan to support access to hydrogen fuel across our fleet of hydrogen-capable plants.
We are also in the very early stages of developing a green hydrogen demonstration plant, Montgomery County Hydrogen Innovation Center. This project will teach us important lessons about electrolysis operations and ultimately lay the groundwork for future full-scale projects. We're excited about these projects in our collaboration with Mitsubishi as we lead our industry to make hydrogen a reality that will create green jobs in the Gulf South region. We'll provide updates on these initiatives as we have new developments.
Being the premier utility means doing our part to create a more sustainable future for our customers, our communities and the world, a goal we continuously strive for in everything we do. In 2020, we were once again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index. We are the only electric utility to receive this honor 19 years in a row, and we are very proud of this recognition as DJSI is one of the most respected independent sustainability measures in the world. We earned perfect scores in the areas of climate strategy, water-related risks, materiality, environmental reporting, social reporting and policy influence.
This past year, our employees demonstrated once again why Entergy is best in class in storm response. During a storm season, unlike any other in our history, our commitment to health, safety and preparedness is one of our proudest achievements. Our teams worked around the clock to safely restore service, to rebuild infrastructure and to help our communities recover while following virus prevention protocols.
For our employees' extraordinary efforts, we received broad support from local, state and federal officials. We also received 5 emergency response awards from EEI. This marks the 23rd consecutive year EEI has recognized Entergy employees for their emergency response.
2020 was another successful year for our company. Everything we accomplished gives me confidence in our ability to meet our goals and commitments going forward. We've proven that we are a resilient company prepared to respond to adversity and deliver on our mission to create sustainable value for our stakeholders. It's what our stakeholders expect from us, and that's what it takes to be the premier utility.
Despite obstacles imposed by the pandemic, mild weather and storms, our employees found ways to connect, innovate, drive growth and build toward the future, all while meeting our financial commitments. The fundamentals of our company are strong, and the drivers that uniquely position us to be the premier utility remain firmly in place. We consistently meet or exceed our guidance expectations. We have line of sight on 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth. And by the end of the year, we expect the same for our dividend growth rate subject to Board approval.
And as we mature in our continuous improvement efforts, we aspire to permanently reduce O&M costs and redeploy those resources for the benefit of our stakeholders. I am as excited as ever about our future. I will now turn the call over to Drew to review our financial performance."

Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting strong results for 2020. As Leo mentioned, we successfully managed lower revenues by lowering our O&M expense by approximately $150 million, which exceeded our $100 million cost-reduction target for the year. Our results today are a validation of the strong, resilient company we are. As a result, we are confident in our continued success going forward and are initiating our guidance and affirming our longer-term outlooks.
I'll begin with a review of results for the full year and then provide an overview of guidance for 2021. Starting on Slide 6. Entergy adjusted EPS for 2020 was $5.66, $0.26 higher than 2019 and the top half of our guidance range.
Moving to Slide 7. There were many drivers that are straightforward and laid out in the release, but the key area of focus for us in 2020 was O&M. We offset the negative impact of storms, COVID-19 and unfavorable weather with approximately $150 million of cost reductions. And to do this, we identified a number of cost-cutting measures early in the year and deliberately executed on our plan.
Slide 8 lists some of the actions taken. We are proud of what we've accomplished, yet we are not surprised. Our employees have built the culture, processes and resources to successfully deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders, even during extraordinary times, and that's been important this year more than ever. Our results further strengthen our confidence in our success going forward as we affirm our earnings expectations from '21 through '23.
The results for EWC summarized on Slide 9 are generally in line with our expectations, and we continue to make good progress on our exit of that business.
Full year operating cash flow, shown on Slide 10, was approximately $2.7 billion. As you would expect, storm costs were a large driver as were lower collections due to COVID-19. Decreased collections for fuel and purchased power costs and unfavorable weather also affected the metric. Lower unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers partly offset the decrease.
Our cash and credit metrics as of the end of the year are shown on Slide 11. Our parent debt to total debt is 21.6% and our FFO to debt is 10.3%. As we mentioned last quarter, our FFO to debt is temporarily lower in part due to the financial impacts from the storms. We expect the metric to return to target levels as we receive storm securitization proceeds next year.
As you know, we have strong precedence for storm cost recovery, and we have planned to submit initial filings over the next few weeks. We'll also pursue off-balance sheet treatment in Louisiana and Texas. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile and is supporting credit targets, including at or above 15% for FFO to debt next year and below 25% for parent debt to total debt.
Moving to Slide 12. With the resiliency we've demonstrated in 2020, we are confident in our continued success in 2021 and beyond. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range is $5.80 to $6.10. And our current plan puts us firmly at the $5.95 midpoint. This and our 2022 and 2023 outlook ranges remain the same as the outlooks we presented at Analyst Day.
We continue to target a 5% to 7% annual growth rate for adjusting -- for adjusted earnings per share. We also expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth rate starting in the fourth quarter of this year subject to final Board approval.
On Slide 11 -- excuse me, on Slide 13, I'm going backwards, we've outlined a few of the key drivers for 2021 earnings growth. We also include more detailed assumptions in the appendix of the webcast presentation. Beginning with the top line of full year of 2020 rate activity, following significant investments to benefit customers will contribute to 2021's growth. We will also make annual FRP filings during the year.
We project utility O&M a little under $2.7 billion, in line with our disclosures from Analyst Day. Depreciation expense is expected to increase, and net interest is expected to decrease due to lower AFUDC as new plants came online in 2020. We also anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be higher.
Our guidance and outlooks reflect the December APSC order in Arkansas and assume an FRP extension in both Arkansas and Louisiana. In Arkansas, we are reprioritizing our O&M and capital investments to more closely align with the ordered recovery structure. To the extent the order is reversed, we will plan to readjust our O&M and capital to deliver the customer benefits that those investments would produce.
While we continue to monitor risks, we have already identified flexible spending levers in the event needed. And we are also exploring permanent upside opportunities through solar investments and further continuous improvement.
As Leo mentioned, 2020 was a strong year for our company. We exceeded our $100 million cost reduction target and delivered on our commitments to each of our 4 key stakeholders in the midst of unprecedented times. Looking ahead, the fundamentals that underlie our steady predictable growth are strong.
Our guidance and outlooks remain the same as we presented at Analyst Day and provide clear line of sight to the 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth rate. We have among the lowest retail rates in the country. And our solid strategic, operational and financial plans will upgrade the service level that we provide to our customers.
Our proven and disciplined flexible spending program helps us adapt to financial headwinds or tailwinds so we can meet our financial commitments. And in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate. We have significant opportunities ahead, and we are well positioned to be the premier utility.
Before turning the call over to Q&A, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank David Borde for his great work as Vice President of Investor Relations. He's built solid relationships with all of you, and the good news is he will not go far. He will work with Rod to help bring our vision of the future utility to life. And for the next few weeks, he will reach out to many of you to introduce Bill Abler, who is taking over leadership of the Investor Relations team.
Bill has a strong commercial background in both commodities and utilities, and he will be an excellent representative for us with you. And as you know, both David and Bill are backed by a very strong team with disciplined processes, so you should not expect any change in the level of service you will see from us there.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

That's the primary thing that we are taking action to adjust with.
In terms of potential upside, as I also said in my remarks, to the extent that we're able to get the order reversed, we would anticipate putting most, if not all, it depends on what the order would say, back into our capital plan so that our customers could benefit from the capital and O&M that we are planning to deploy in Arkansas.

Our other considerations are execution and distraction from the things that we are doing to further create value for our stakeholders already underway.
And the second one is probably the one that makes it perhaps a little bit challenging for us in the sense of trying to do that for equity raises because we would likely require approval from regulatory commissions in order to do any sort of M&A activity at the opcos. And so while we might be able to find good value, if we were counting on that for an equity raise and we had to go through the regulatory process, that would create a lot of uncertainty in that equity rate. So it's probably not the best path for us. But certainly, if there is value-creation opportunity out there, then we would be looking at it."

But are the lessons learned sort of resulting in potential for further either acceleration of spending or changes to plans, whether it be generation plans, renewables plans, et cetera?

But Stephen, certainly, every event that occurs has unique attributes that allow us to have lessons that we learn. And so whether it's the hurricanes or tropical storms, Harvey is different than Laura, for example, in terms of what the impact it had on reasonably similar areas of our service territory. And what we've experienced, obviously, we're still in the process of getting the lessons learned about the events that we saw last week.
So we always -- I wouldn't say that it's inconsistent with the plans we have for resiliency. But certainly, every time we go through any kind of event, we will learn something that we will apply to the next events. So there are things we learned in Katrina that have really served us well for every event that occurred after that, both in terms of what we do to our system and how our capital shapes up, but also as well as our processes and our operations and our interactions with the industry, et cetera.
So there will be lessons learned and they will direct our activities potentially differently. I wouldn't say that it's going to create an incremental capital spend or anything like that, potentially redirection of it. Now it could provide some incremental capital spend. 
If in working with our regulators, they determine -- we jointly determine that there are things that we need to do more quickly than we otherwise would have done. But I wouldn't say right now that there's some anticipation of a change in the size of the capital plan going forward because of these events might be a change in direction for some things just to prioritize differently.
But everything is a learning experience, and we'll continue to do that. And as I said, the events last week, we're still unpacking everything there."

But the -- but on the fuel costs, I think it's -- all in, it's about $500 million. I would say about $100 million is kind of what we would normally have expected. And that gets you to the $400 million that Leo was talking about. Of the $500 million, about $200 million of it is in Louisiana, and that is about 90% to 95% ELL and the rest in New Orleans. About $150 million is in Texas. And these are all round numbers. As I mentioned, you'll have specific ones later.
There is a positive deferred fuel balance in Texas of about $90 million that will help offset that and then in the neighborhood of $100 million in Arkansas and around $50 million in Mississippi. So that's kind of how that would all break down."

We are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.47 per share. That's an excellent start to the year, and it keeps us on track to deliver on our commitments to you and all our stakeholders. In addition to solid earnings, we reached settlements on several important issues, reducing risk, providing long-term clarity in solidifying a clear path for our future growth. 
In Arkansas, we resolved the FRP through settlement and legislation, which included a 5-year extension, and an equitable outcome for the netting adjustment. We reached agreement on a 3-year extension of the formula rate plan in Louisiana, our largest jurisdiction. We received an initial decision in the system energy, ROE and capital structure case. While we believe we have strong arguments for a better outcome in the final FERC decision, the ALJ recommendations would be manageable within our current long-term forecasts. We filed a joint settlement agreement among all parties, paving the way for the sale of the Indian Point Energy Center to [ Holtec ] before midyear. We are pleased with the outcomes of these proceedings as they provide certainty for you, our owners and regulatory clarity with more than 90% of our capital plan to be recovered with timely mechanisms. This enables us to continue to make investments in a cleaner generation fleet and a more reliable delivery system that benefit our customers and our communities, and support the long-term growth of our business. 
Last quarter, we provided a comprehensive update on our [ Clean Energy ] efforts. We are intently focused on expanding renewables while pursuing other clean energy solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, and investing in the utilities carbon-free nuclear fleet. So far this year, we have initiated 3 requests for proposals totaling 1,000 megawatts of renewables. We are also exploring structural options for renewable projects that will lower the cost of these investments for our customers and help ensure that we have the capital required for other needed investments that benefit our customers. 
Our renewable portfolio has grown significantly. We have nearly doubled our renewables capacity over the past 3 years. With announced projects, and we have clear line of sight to more than 2,500 megawatts by the end of 2025, which will more than quadruple our renewable capacity from 2020. And we expect to double that with more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030. 
In addition to renewables, we are also looking at other technologies that will help us achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Those technologies include [indiscernible] to combine with renewables to provide short-term storage flexibility. We are actively developing options to utilize hydrogen to support and leverage a large renewable fleet, and provide clean energy with long-term flexibility. We see hydrogen as a form of long duration storage for renewables, which, when combined with our nuclear fleet, allows us to add additional intermittent renewable power to the grid and yet maintain reliable, dispatchable power that is 100% clean. Entergy's service area is well positioned to play a key role in the transition to green hydrogen, as we are in the heart of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and industrial users. 
We have a relationship with Mitsubishi Power to advance our future in hydrogen. Together, we are working on the Orange County Power and storage project, which will be hydrogen-capable day 1, and eventually able to run on 100% hydrogen. We are also developing the Montgomery County innovation center to advance electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Long-term, our goal is for all of our capacity to be low or zero emitting. 
In addition to operating one of the cleanest large-scale generating fleets in the country, we are committed to helping our customers meet their sustainability, reliability and cost goals through electrification. This is an excellent long-term opportunity for us to create sustainable value for our customers across the Gulf South. We've already described how our short power initiative has the potential to lower our customers' emissions and operating costs while we grow our business. In March, we announced the [ Electric Highway  ]coalition, a multistate electric vehicle charging initiative. This collaboration will increase the number of charging options across multiple states, thereby improving convenience of long-range driving with electric vehicles. 
Our fleet plan will also improve our carbon footprint. With the help of our vendor partners, we have set a goal that all newly acquired passenger vehicles, forklifts, [ Palo Jaks ] and similar equipment, be fully electric, starting in 2023. As Congress puts together the legislation to implement the overarching vision of President Biden's infrastructure initiative, we see potential opportunities to improve services to our customers, improve the resiliency of the power delivery system, enhance our transition to low and zero carbon power generation, and produce growth for our region. The proposal is far from final, but the environmental and social goals are aligned with our values and the work we are doing. Because of the improving economics of renewable resources and our customers' desire for green power to support their own sustainability goals, we believe there will be support for projects that will benefit all of our stakeholders. With policy support, those projects can be done faster and at a lower cost. 
On Monday, we announced leadership changes in our utility organization that will sharpen our customer focus. [ David Ellis ] has been named our first Chief Customer Officer. He will lead the [ Utility's ] strategic efforts aimed at delivering extraordinary customer experiences while also bringing to market innovative solutions to keep pace with evolving customer needs and expectations. David has nearly 30 years of experience in customer solutions, technology, energy management and reliability. [ Deanna Rodrigues ] will succeed David as President and CEO of Entergy New Orleans. Deanna has been with Entergy for 27 years. Her industry experience, combined with their background in regulatory affairs, make her ideally suited for the role. 
The addition of David as our first Chief Customer Officer as well as Deanna's move to New Orleans show our commitment to improving our customers' experiences and building the premier utility. 
We all know that our employees rose to the challenges of 2020, and their resiliency has continued this year. The ice and freezing temperatures of winter storm in Missouri this past February presented challenges across many aspects of our operations. Our employees work tirelessly to balance the system and minimize customer outages. We committed $650,000 to help community nonprofits and qualifying customers who are affected by the winter event. Grants went directly to local nonprofits assisting low-income customers with emergency needs, including food banks, and SBP, an organization that helps communities rebuild after weather events. Additionally, funded -- funding was also provided to the power to care, which provides payment assistance energy customers who are low-income seniors, and people with disabilities. We also implemented new bill payment options for customers experiencing financial hardship. 
Indian Point Unit 3 will shutdown in just a few days, and we expect to complete the sale of that plant in just over a month. The Indian Point team is finishing strong as operations wind down. In fact, they are finishing so strong that they set a new world record for the longest continuous run for a light-water reactor. I would like to thank the employees of Indian Point for their dedicated service to the plant, New York and to Entergy. Through this entire shutdown and sale process, we have remained committed to our employees and all those qualified and willing to relocate, have been offered positions. We look forward to them starting the next phase of their careers with us. 
As I said, it's been a very productive start for 2021, and we will continue to successfully achieve the milestones that keep us on track to deliver steady, predictable earnings and dividend growth for you, our owners, while investing to benefit our customers and creating value for all our stakeholders. 
Before I turn it over to Drew, I encourage you to read our recently released 2020 integrated report forward together. The report outlines the significant accomplishments of 2020. When faced with circumstances that threaten to divide us, we chose to tackle challenges head on, and move forward together. We supported our customers, employees and communities. We champion diversity, inclusion and belonging, and we delivered on our financial commitments. The report outlines in detail the solid foundation that underlies our strategy, to deliver steady, predictable growth, including sustainability leadership among the lowest retail rates in the country, one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets and getting cleaner, a robust customer-centric capital plan, constructive regulatory mechanisms and a commitment to continuous improvement for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
With the solid foundation that we have built over the last several years, and the significant opportunities that lie ahead, we are more excited than ever for what our future holds. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will review our first quarter results as well as our outlooks."

As Leo mentioned, we successfully executed on several fronts and resolved key regulatory proceedings. As a result, we continue to improve the clarity on our strong path forward. We remain confident in our future growth, and we are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we had a strong start for the year with adjusted earnings of $1.47 per share. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that the primary drivers for the positive quarter were straightforward and largely a result of investing for our customers and executing on our strategy. We continue to see the effects of rate actions across our jurisdictions to recover the investments we have made to benefit customers. Operating expenses, including O&M and depreciation were also higher. Resident sales were stronger with and without the effects of weather, and the weather was largely due to winter storm [indiscernible]. This was tempered by lower sales quarter-over-quarter in other customer classes due to the effects of COVID-19. Although overall sales were in line with our expectations. This quarter's results also included the reversal of a regulatory reserve that we recorded in fourth quarter 2020. The reserve reflects the Arkansas Commission's original order on the 2021 formula rate plan. With further legislative and regulatory clarity on the netting adjustment methodology, the reserve is no longer needed. And income taxes were higher due to items that benefited 2020. 
Our first quarter financial performance, combined with an improved result in Arkansas has put us in a good position. Following up with the plan we discussed last quarter, we're now able to pull flex levers and put back some of the spending and investments for the benefits of our customers. 
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. As reported earnings per share were $0.19, $0.74 higher than the prior year. The key driver was better market performance of EWC's nuclear decommissioning trusts. As Leo mentioned, we filed a joint settlement with the New York Public Service Commission earlier this month, which is a key milestone for the sale of Indian Point, and we're on track to shutdown the plant in 2 days as well as close the sale near the end of May. Over the past several years, we have worked systematically to eliminate risks associated with exiting the business. This includes regulatory risk, commodity price risk. Operational risk is evidenced by Indian Point's record run, and risk for employees. In fact, we have said many plays will continue their careers in other areas of Entergy's operations or with Holtec. The result is that we have dramatically improved our business risk profile and are at the threshold of successfully exiting EWC next spring. 
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow for the quarter. The result is lower than you may be expecting, but is caused by 2 timing-related factors of which you are aware. First, deferred fuel costs mostly due to winter storm [indiscernible], and discussed in our last call, were approximately $350 million in the quarter, and we expect to recover them over the next few months. And second, the payments for noncapital costs related to last year's hurricane restoration efforts were approximately $200 million. These hurricane restoration costs will be recovered through our storm recovery filings. Despite this quarter's results, our 3-year operating cash flow expectation of more than $10 billion has not changed. 
As you might anticipate, this affects our current credit metrics, which are shown on Slide 9. Our parent debt to total debt is 20.3%, and our FFO to debt is 8.2%. As we have mentioned for the past few quarters, our FFO to debt is temporarily suppressed in part due to financial impacts from storms, including winter storm [indiscernible]. FFO is lower as a result of the higher deferred fuel costs in the noncapital portion of the storm restoration costs, while that is currently higher as it was used to pay for the restoration efforts. As we've said, the debt will return to normal once we receive securitization proceeds next year. We made our first storm recovery filing in Texas this month, and we will file in Louisiana and New Orleans in the near future. Also, legislation is moving ahead in Louisiana and Texas to support off-balance sheet treatment. In both states, this legislation has already unanimously passed 1 legislative chamber, and now moves forward to the other. 
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile and supporting credit targets, and we still expect to be at or above 15% for FFO to debt next year and remain below 25% for parent debt to total debt. 
Moving to Slide 10. We are affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook. As Leo mentioned, we settled the Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan and resolved the Entergy Arkansas formula rate plan, including the appropriate netting adjustment methodology, and a 5-year extension. Our O&M and capital spending plans are aligned with these outcomes. In addition, as we progress through the year, we'll continue to utilize our flexible spending leverage to support steady, predictable earnings growth. 
Looking ahead, we continue to have a clear line of sight on our 5% to 7% annual growth rate for adjusted earnings per share, and we expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth rate in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Board approval. We have a solid foundation to achieve our stakeholder objectives, built on operational excellence and risk reduction. 
As we move forward together with our stakeholders, we see a clear path for future growth through our core utility business, and emerging opportunities associated with sustainability and improving our customer experience. This includes hydrogen and renewables on which we are keenly focused, as Leo discussed, and which we expect to benefit all stakeholders and support our growth trajectory throughout the decade and beyond. 
We see 2021 being another successful year for Entergy, and we look forward to great opportunities ahead as we work towards our goal to become the premier utility. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And then we're still where we were when we talked to you last summer. The other thing associated with the methods in which we might go access that equity capital. We've talked a little bit about that in the past. Certainly, we have the ability to go do block equity. But more recently, we put a plan in place to do at the market. And next week, we have our proxy results, which we've requested from you all, our owners, to allow us to do preferred equity. We think that gives more flexibility in terms of accessing that capital, and we think we can do it in a more shareholder friendly way because it gives us the opportunity to potentially convert and not dilute our existing owners today. So that's something that we're looking to get next week, and so we'll know the result of that. In regards to, I think, the other thing that you're hinting at is something that we addressed last quarter as well around the potential sale of a portion of equity from an operating company going forward. And as we said, there is a difference between, obviously, the cost of equity at the operating company and where we are trading today. So that is something that we would look closely at. But that is still very much a strategic decision. That's a long-term decision and sort of [ macerating ] around as a financing decision, and it's really not because you can't do the transaction and then close in a couple of days. You're going to be waiting 18 to 24 months because you've got to go get regulatory approval in our jurisdictions. But it doesn't make it ideal from that perspective. There are other considerations that you have to also take into account in addition to the regulatory and the timing risk. As we've seen others execute on that, it didn't actually solve their credit problem. They ended up getting downgraded anyway. So that's something that we would be -- have to be keenly aware of. But as a strategic issue, it's something that we pay attention to, and it's something that we are evaluating and continue to evaluate because the price difference is out there. Because of the strategic question, it started to get into the more M&A stuff around. Okay. So -- and you do this when you go ask for approval, can you execute on it. We think there's some value there. And we'll distract you from other things that are going on in the utility business, so that -- our ability to execute.

And then I'll also add just from a macro perspective that we are seeing some good signals in the industrial space. We are -- we see that inventories for some of our key petchem and refined products customers are trending back to normal. So some of that inventory overhang has gone away. As a result, we've seen margins improve, crack spreads or geographic spreads. Henry Hub to Asia and Europe, for example, are trending in the right direction. And it looks like the housing market is starting to tick up. So that could help out our chlor-alkali customers and some of just the basic macro factors like oil prices are better now.

And I think our service territory really bodes well across a variety of new technological advancements, and again, will be helpful, not only for the power sector, but for the people who produce some of those commodities as well as people consume those commodities. So you've probably seen a lot of press lately about what a lot of our customers are doing in both hydrogen and in carbon capture as well as renewables. So there's a significant amount of opportunity for us, whether it's [ 45 Q ] as it stands today or whatever happens with the infrastructure legislation or tax policy around that. It's really early in the game. But certainly, the administration has been very clear that new technologies that provide the opportunity to lower the carbon footprint of the power sector and our industrial customers are all fair game for tax credits all fair game for other support and initiatives that could help accelerate the development of things like not only renewables, battery storage, but carbon capture hydrogen utilization and hydrogen production, hydrogen transportation, hydrogen storage, all of that is when you say, how do we line up those people who are talking in other sectors about carbon capture and talking about production of green hydrogen or all of our customers. And so how near-term is it? That's why we are investigating those technologies on our own with our customers and through our JDA with Mitsubishi to try to tease out the technologies, tease out the costs. And accelerate the ability to utilize those. If you think about it, if carbon capture and hydrogen, for example, become more economic and get to market faster than our deployment of renewables can increase, and go faster. So that all works really hand-in-hand. So early in the game, I think there's a lot of support, both through extension of existing policy plus the potential for new policy. We're working closely, not only with the industry, but with the folks in Washington and the administration ourselves, plus with our partners and our customers to try to really advance the ball on this because we think we're uniquely positioned as it relates to all of those because it's final to us, it's vital to the customers that we have as well. So I really think there's a lot of momentum behind it at the moment as well."

It doesn't change any of our outlooks, but that was a little different than our expectation. That would, if it stands, translate to a slightly higher need for us to reserve at some point if the FERC comes out at the same place that the ALJ does. I think it would be $20 million to $25 million kind of onetime on that change. But we -- as you saw, we filed last week to see if we could convince the FERC that it ought to be a little bit higher.

So we're comfortable with where we are on the S&P metrics. The Moody's metrics are a little more challenging, as you know, because their cash flow from operations to debt, not including working capital. That is the sort of that 15% threshold, and that's what we've been really aiming for. And we still believe we're going to get there next year. In order to do that, we have to get past these cash flow items that we've experienced for the storms, some of the ones that I talked about this quarter, and we need to get the securitization. And ideally, we'll be able to do that off sheet as well. And as I mentioned, that legislation is moving forward in both Texas and Louisiana to do that. So I think we're actually in good shape to achieve all those objectives. In terms of the conversation with Moody's, I mean, obviously, you'll have to talk to them to get their perspective. But I think they understand what's going on, they understand that we have very good, solid mechanisms between fuel recovery, and with securitization. We have a history there, and they can see the results in the legislature going forward. So they're very comfortable that we are going to be able to make that progress. And they've actually written that they don't expect us to hit their target until 2023. So we're actually -- we're aiming to hit their target a year earlier than they would expect us to.

As you said, we've got RFPs for 1,000 megawatts outstanding right now. Our current thinking is that the renewable path would be about 2,500 megawatts by 2025, up to 5,000 by 2030. And I think the right way to think about it is we're trying to make a low cost, reliable and sustainable footprint. And as we look going forward, as technology improves, as prices come down as battery storage gets more economical. That just makes the possibility for renewables to play a bigger part in the resource plan going forward, a reality, and that's what you've seen. And we evaluate resource plan on a regular basis. But we don't stop with the resource plan. We evaluate each individual product on a regular basis. And so as you know, we've got the Orange County Power and storage station that we'll -- that we're developing that on day 1, we'll have hydrogen capability and with being provided in the development space to be 100% hydrogen-capable at the point in time when that makes sense. To the extent that gets accelerated. That allows us to put more renewables into our footprint because we got that long-term storage flexibility. So when you think about our resource plan, we're just trying to meet the need that when you flip the switch, the lights come on. That's the need we got to meet. We want to do it as efficiently and cleanly as possible. And that just as technology has come to the point where that's a bigger and bigger renewable footprint. And again, if some of these other technologies are viable and cost effective, that really helps accelerate the renewable deployment as well. And so we continue to evaluate every project and every resource plan with those things in mind. So I'm excited about the possibility that 5,000 gets bigger at some point. And we've got a lot of time between now and 2030 to make that happen. And with, again, the infrastructure support coming out of the policy environment, that only will tend to make that technology advance further, faster and be more economical for our customers if there's, again, that policy support."

As I mentioned, the resource plan, it's not like we said it, and then we just put it on autopilot, and we're going to follow through on it regardless of what happens. So we're already looking at the plan that we have, and determining based on different policy scenarios, what that might do to change the economics such that the plan itself has changed. And again, as I mentioned, the more support -- policy support for these technologies occur, the lower cost they are for our customers and the faster they're going to accelerate in terms of their development as vital. That's -- we see that as having a positive impact on the cost to the customers as well as the sustainability of the resource plan itself. So I mean, the short answer is absolutely. We're already looking at what those impacts might be. And certainly, like everybody else in the industry, we're playing our part in helping the congressional leaders and the administrative leaders understand what those impacts might be on the industry, on Entergy, and on our region. And as I mentioned earlier, there's not only a growth opportunity for us in some of these policies. But the people who are making hydrogen today, Stephen, are in our service territory and are our customers. The people who are utilizing that hydrogen are in our service territory and our customers. So it's our intention to work with them in helping them meet their sustainability goals and their sustainability requirements depending on what again comes out of legislation and administrative situation in Washington to help them with their sustainability objectives. So if you think about major hydrogen producers today through gas reformation, if they're going to have to get carbon capture or renewables, we want to be there to help them with that."

Certainly, we're in the early phases of evaluating exactly what their needs are, what they want to do and what they can -- what their exposure is as well as how we want to participate. So we're really in the range of investigation right now. One is, for example, with our fleet itself, what we're going to utilize. The Montgomery County innovation center that I talked about. That is a 22-megawatt electrolysis facility that we're looking to develop, where we would be, obviously, creating green hydrogen that we would then test in our own facilities as we use that as a precursor up to and then how Orange County is going to utilize green hydrogen in its own -- for the production of electricity. At the same point in time, to the extent carbon capture is something that a hydrogen producer might want to utilize our ability to provide them with economic renewables would be a way to obviously create new load and new renewables for us to be able to help them with that. And to the extent that they want to pursue electrolysis in their own production of green hydrogen, and we can provide the clean energy, whether it's through nuclear or through renewables, we can do that as well. So we're investigating all aspects of that. At the same point in time, there is transportation infrastructure down here in terms of pipelines and everything. For that, we need to look at how that transportation tees up to our own facilities as well as amongst the service territory. And then we've got storage facilities that are capable of being converted to store hydrogen. And so we're looking at that and what role that can play not only for us but for our customers. So there's a wide range of things that we're looking at. Obviously, our lane is to be the utility in all of this. And -- but as this progresses and we collaborate with Mitsubishi, and we collaborate with our customers, the opportunity to be the utility and provide the electricity for all of this to happen should be pretty significant if it all plays out. And I would say that the creation of the customer organization where we announced David Ellis' position within Rod's organization, that's going to be a pretty significant organization that we're developing is designed to help and collaborate with those customers on these new needs that they have. So I know that wasn't a specific list of projects, Stephen, but it's more of a pretty wide-ranging opportunity. We're going to stay in our lane, but yet, we're going to really pursue being able to make it reality."

So that is ongoing I wouldn't say that, that's a significant amount of capital that would go into those facilities compared to the size of capital budget as it sits today. But certainly, we're looking at proven resiliency. And all of the investments that we're making in the normal capital plan are meant to improve power quality and reliability. And so as we do, for example, with our transmission system, all of the new stuff we build is to a higher standard than what we built 20 years ago. And as we saw in Hurricane Laura, all the stuff that we built with the new technology, which stood the hurricane. It was the stuff that we built 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago that was destroyed.

We are reporting first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.47 per share. That's an excellent start to the year, and it keeps us on track to deliver on our commitments to you and all our stakeholders. In addition to solid earnings, we reached settlements on several important issues, reducing risk, providing long-term clarity in solidifying a clear path for our future growth.
In Arkansas, we resolved the FRP through settlement and legislation, which included a 5-year extension, and an equitable outcome for the netting adjustment. We reached agreement on a 3-year extension of the formula rate plan in Louisiana, our largest jurisdiction. We received an initial decision in the system energy, ROE and capital structure case. While we believe we have strong arguments for a better outcome in the final FERC decision, the ALJ recommendations would be manageable within our current long-term forecasts. 
We filed a joint settlement agreement among all parties, paving the way for the sale of the Indian Point Energy Center to Holtec before midyear. We are pleased with the outcomes of these proceedings as they provide certainty for you, our owners and regulatory clarity with more than 90% of our capital plan to be recovered with timely mechanisms. This enables us to continue to make investments in a cleaner generation fleet and a more reliable delivery system that benefit our customers and our communities, and support the long-term growth of our business.
Last quarter, we provided a comprehensive update on our clean energy efforts. We are intently focused on expanding renewables while pursuing other clean energy solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture, and investing in the utilities carbon-free nuclear fleet. So far this year, we have initiated 3 requests for proposals totaling 1,000 megawatts of renewables. We are also exploring structural options for renewable projects that will lower the cost of these investments for our customers and help ensure that we have the capital required for other needed investments that benefit our customers.
Our renewable portfolio has grown significantly. We have nearly doubled our renewables capacity over the past 3 years. With announced projects in RFPs, and we have clear line of sight to more than 2,500 megawatts by the end of 2025, which will more than quadruple our renewable capacity from 2020. And we expect to double that with more than 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030.
In addition to renewables, we are also looking at other technologies that will help us achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Those technologies include [indiscernible] to combine with renewables to provide short-term storage flexibility. We are actively developing options to utilize hydrogen to support and leverage a large renewable fleet, and provide clean energy with long-term flexibility. We see hydrogen as a form of long duration storage for renewables, which, when combined with our nuclear fleet, allows us to add additional intermittent renewable power to the grid and yet maintain reliable, dispatchable power that is 100% clean. 
Entergy's service area is well positioned to play a key role in the transition to green hydrogen, as we are in the heart of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and industrial users. We have a relationship with Mitsubishi Power to advance our future in hydrogen. Together, we are working on the Orange County Power and storage project, which will be hydrogen-capable day 1, and eventually able to run on 100% hydrogen. We are also developing the Montgomery County innovation center to advance electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Long-term, our goal is for all of our capacity to be low or zero emitting.
In addition to operating one of the cleanest large-scale generating fleets in the country, we are committed to helping our customers meet their sustainability, reliability and cost goals through electrification. This is an excellent long-term opportunity for us to create sustainable value for our customers across the Gulf South. 
We've already described how our Shore Power initiative has the potential to lower our customers' emissions and operating costs while we grow our business. In March, we announced the Electric Highway Coalition, a multi-state electric vehicle charging initiative. This collaboration will increase the number of charging options across multiple states, thereby improving convenience of long-range driving with electric vehicles.
Our fleet plan will also improve our carbon footprint. With the help of our vendor partners, we have set a goal that all newly acquired passenger vehicles, forklifts, pallet jacks and similar equipment, be fully electric, starting in 2023. 
As Congress puts together the legislation to implement the overarching vision of President Biden's infrastructure initiative, we see potential opportunities to improve services to our customers, improve the resiliency of the power delivery system, enhance our transition to low and zero carbon power generation, and produce growth for our region. The proposal is far from final, but the environmental and social goals are aligned with our values and the work we are doing. 
Because of the improving economics of renewable resources and our customers' desire for green power to support their own sustainability goals, we believe there will be support for projects that will benefit all of our stakeholders. With policy support, those projects can be done faster and at a lower cost.
On Monday, we announced leadership changes in our utility organization that will sharpen our customer focus. David Ellis has been named our first Chief Customer Officer. He will lead the Utility's strategic efforts aimed at delivering extraordinary customer experiences while also bringing to market innovative solutions to keep pace with evolving customer needs and expectations. David has nearly 30 years of experience in customer solutions, technology, energy management and reliability. 
Deanna Rodriguez will succeed David as President and CEO of Entergy New Orleans. Deanna has been with Entergy for 27 years. Her industry experience, combined with her background in regulatory affairs, make her ideally suited for the role.
The addition of David as our first Chief Customer Officer as well as Deanna's move to New Orleans show our commitment to improving our customers' experiences and building the premier utility.
We all know that our employees rose to the challenges of 2020, and their resiliency has continued this year. The ice and freezing temperatures of Winter Storm Uri this past February presented challenges across many aspects of our operations. Our employees work tirelessly to balance the system and minimize customer outages. We committed $650,000 to help community nonprofits and qualifying customers who are affected by the winter event. Grants went directly to local nonprofits assisting low-income customers with emergency needs, including food banks, and SBP, an organization that helps communities rebuild after weather events. 
Additionally, funded -- funding was also provided to The Power to Care, which provides payment assistance to Entergy customers who are low-income seniors, and people with disabilities. We also implemented new bill payment options for customers experiencing financial hardship.
Indian Point Unit 3 will shutdown in just a few days, and we expect to complete the sale of that plant in just over a month. The Indian Point team is finishing strong as operations wind down. In fact, they are finishing so strong that they set a new world record for the longest continuous run for a light water reactor. I would like to thank the employees of Indian Point for their dedicated service to the plant, New York and to Entergy. Through this entire shutdown and sale process, we have remained committed to our employees and all those qualified and willing to relocate, have been offered positions. We look forward to them starting the next phase of their careers with us.
As I said, it's been a very productive start for 2021, and we will continue to successfully achieve the milestones that keep us on track to deliver steady, predictable earnings and dividend growth for you, our owners, while investing to benefit our customers and creating value for all our stakeholders.
Before I turn it over to Drew, I encourage you to read our recently released 2020 integrated report forward together. The report outlines the significant accomplishments of 2020. When faced with circumstances that threatened to divide us, we chose to tackle challenges head on, and move forward together. We supported our customers, employees and communities. We champion diversity, inclusion and belonging, and we delivered on our financial commitments. The report outlines in detail the solid foundation that underlies our strategy, to deliver steady, predictable growth, including sustainability leadership among the lowest retail rates in the country, one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets and getting cleaner, a robust customer-centric capital plan, constructive regulatory mechanisms and a commitment to continuous improvement for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
With the solid foundation that we have built over the last several years, and the significant opportunities that lie ahead, we are more excited than ever for what our future holds. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will review our first quarter results as well as our outlooks."

As Leo mentioned, we successfully executed on several fronts and resolved key regulatory proceedings. As a result, we continue to improve the clarity on our strong path forward. We remain confident in our future growth, and we are affirming our guidance and longer-term outlooks. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we had a strong start for the year with adjusted earnings of $1.47 per share. Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that the primary drivers for the positive quarter were straightforward and largely a result of investing for our customers and executing on our strategy. We continue to see the effects of rate actions across our jurisdictions to recover the investments we have made to benefit customers. 
Operating expenses, including O&M and depreciation were also higher. Residential sales were stronger with and without the effects of weather, and the weather was largely due to Winter Storm Uri. This was tempered by lower sales quarter-over-quarter in other customer classes due to the effects of COVID-19. Although overall sales were in line with our expectations. 
This quarter's results also included the reversal of a regulatory reserve that we recorded in fourth quarter 2020. The reserve reflects the Arkansas Commission's original order on the 2021 formula rate plan. With further legislative and regulatory clarity on the netting adjustment methodology, the reserve is no longer needed. And income taxes were higher due to items that benefited 2020.
Our first quarter financial performance, combined with an improved result in Arkansas has put us in a good position. Following up with the plan we discussed last quarter, we're now able to pull flex levers and put back some of the spending and investments for the benefits of our customers.
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. As reported, earnings per share were $0.19, $0.74 higher than the prior year. The key driver was better market performance of EWC's nuclear decommissioning trusts. As Leo mentioned, we filed a joint settlement with the New York Public Service Commission earlier this month, which is a key milestone for the sale of Indian Point, and we're on track to shutdown the plant in 2 days as well as close the sale near the end of May. 
Over the past several years, we have worked systematically to eliminate risks associated with exiting the business. This includes regulatory risk, commodity price risk. Operational risk is evidenced by Indian Point's record run, and risk for employees. In fact, we have said many employees will continue their careers in other areas of Entergy's operations or with Holtec. The result is that we have dramatically improved our business risk profile and are at the threshold of successfully exiting EWC next spring.
Slide 8 shows operating cash flow for the quarter. The result is lower than you may be expecting, but is caused by 2 timing-related factors of which you are aware. First, deferred fuel costs mostly due to Winter Storm Uri, and discussed in our last call, were approximately $350 million in the quarter, and we expect to recover them over the next few months. 
And second, the payments for noncapital costs related to last year's hurricane restoration efforts were approximately $200 million. These hurricane restoration costs will be recovered through our storm recovery filings. Despite this quarter's results, our 3-year operating cash flow expectation of more than $10 billion has not changed.
As you might anticipate, this affects our current credit metrics, which are shown on Slide 9. Our parent debt to total debt is 20.3%, and our FFO to debt is 8.2%. As we have mentioned for the past few quarters, our FFO to debt is temporarily suppressed in part due to financial impacts from storms, including Winter Storm Uri. FFO is lower as a result of the higher deferred fuel costs in the noncapital portion of the storm restoration costs, while that is currently higher as it was used to pay for the restoration efforts. 
As we've said, the debt will return to normal once we receive securitization proceeds next year. We made our first storm recovery filing in Texas this month, and we will file in Louisiana and New Orleans in the near future. Also, legislation is moving ahead in Louisiana and Texas to support off-balance sheet treatment. In both states, this legislation has already unanimously passed 1 legislative chamber, and now moves forward to the other.
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile and supporting credit targets, and we still expect to be at or above 15% for FFO to debt next year and remain below 25% for parent debt to total debt.
Moving to Slide 10. We are affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook. As Leo mentioned, we settled the Entergy Louisiana formula rate plan and resolved the Entergy Arkansas formula rate plan, including the appropriate netting adjustment methodology, and a 5-year extension. 
Our O&M and capital spending plans are aligned with these outcomes. In addition, as we progress through the year, we'll continue to utilize our flexible spending leverage to support steady, predictable earnings growth.
Looking ahead, we continue to have a clear line of sight on our 5% to 7% annual growth rate for adjusted earnings per share, and we expect to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth rate in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Board approval. We have a solid foundation to achieve our stakeholder objectives, built on operational excellence and risk reduction.
As we move forward together with our stakeholders, we see a clear path for future growth through our core utility business, and emerging opportunities associated with sustainability and improving our customer experience. This includes hydrogen and renewables on which we are keenly focused, as Leo discussed, and which we expect to benefit all stakeholders and support our growth trajectory throughout the decade and beyond.
We see 2021 being another successful year for Entergy, and we look forward to great opportunities ahead as we work towards our goal to become the premier utility.
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

And then in regards to the reserve for SIRI, on the uncertain tax position, we have not -- as we said before, we haven't made any reserves for that position.

And then we're still where we were when we talked to you last summer. The other thing associated with the methods in which we might go access that equity capital. We've talked a little bit about that in the past. Certainly, we have the ability to go do block equity. But more recently, we put a plan in place to do at the market. And next week, we have our proxy results, which we've requested from you all, our owners, to allow us to do preferred equity. We think that gives more flexibility in terms of accessing that capital, and we think we can do it in a more shareholder friendly way because it gives us the opportunity to potentially converts and not dilute our existing owners today. So that's something that we're looking to get next week, and so we'll know the result of that. 
In regards to, I think, the other thing that you're hinting at is something that we addressed last quarter as well around the potential sale of a portion of equity from an operating company going forward. And as we said, there is a difference between, obviously, the cost of equity at the operating company and where we are trading today. So that is something that we would look closely at. But that is still very much a strategic decision. That's a long-term decision and sort of macerating around as a financing decision, and it's really not because you can't do the transaction and then close in a couple of days. You're going to be waiting 18 to 24 months because you've got to go get regulatory approval in our jurisdictions. But it doesn't make it ideal from that perspective. 
There are other considerations that you have to also take into account in addition to the regulatory and the timing risk. As we've seen others execute on that, it didn't actually solve their credit problem. They ended up getting downgraded anyway. So that's something that we would be -- have to be keenly aware of. But as a strategic issue, it's something that we pay attention to, and it's something that we are evaluating and continue to evaluate because the price difference is out there. Because of the strategic question, it started to get into the more M&A stuff around. Okay. So can you do this when you go ask for approval? Can you execute on it? We think there's some value there. And will it distract you from other things that are going on in the utility business, so that -- our ability to execute. So that's kind of a long answer around sort of a financing question, but really turns into an M&A question on the key point that I think you're looking for."

And then I'll also add just from a macro perspective that we are seeing some good signals in the industrial space. We are -- we see that inventories for some of our key petchem and refined products, customers are trending back to normal. So some of that inventory overhang has gone away. As a result, we've seen margins improve, crack spreads or geographic spreads. Henry Hub to Asia and Europe, for example, are trending in the right direction. And it looks like the housing market is starting to tick up. So that could help out our chlor-alkali customers and some of just the basic macro factors like oil prices are better now.

That's a -- carbon capture is just one piece of the puzzle here. And I think our service territory really bodes well across a variety of new technological advancements, and again, will be helpful, not only for the power sector, but for the people who produce some of those commodities as well as people consume those commodities. So you've probably seen a lot of press lately about what a lot of our customers are doing in both hydrogen and in carbon capture as well as renewables. 
So there's a significant amount of opportunity for us, whether it's 45Q as it stands today or whatever happens with the infrastructure, legislation or tax policy around that. It's really early in the game. But certainly, the administration has been very clear that new technologies that provide the opportunity to lower the carbon footprint of the power sector and our industrial customers are all fair game for tax credits, all fair game for other support and initiatives that could help accelerate the development of things like not only renewables, battery storage, but carbon capture, hydrogen utilization and hydrogen production, hydrogen transportation, hydrogen storage, all of that is -- when you say, how do we line up those people who are talking in other sectors about carbon capture and talking about production of green hydrogen are all of our customers. 
And so how near-term is it? That's why we are investigating those technologies on our own with our customers and through our JDA with Mitsubishi to try to tease out the technologies, tease out the costs. And accelerate the ability to utilize those. 
If you think about it, if carbon capture and hydrogen, for example, become more economic and get to market faster then our deployment of renewables can increase, and go faster. So that all works really hand-in-hand. So early in the game, I think there's a lot of support, both through extension of existing policy plus the potential for new policy. We're working closely, not only with the industry, but with the folks in Washington and the administration ourselves, plus with our partners and our customers to try to really advance the ball on this because we think we're uniquely positioned as it relates to all of those because it's vital to us, it's vital to the customers that we have as well. So I really think there's a lot of momentum behind it at the moment as well."

It doesn't change any of our outlooks, but that was a little different than our expectation. 
That would, if it stands, translate to a slightly higher need for us to reserve at some point if the FERC comes out at the same place that the ALJ does. I think it would be $20 million to $25 million kind of onetime on that change. But we -- as you saw, we filed last week to see if we could convince the FERC that it ought to be a little bit higher.

Even through all of this, we are above the downgrade threshold that they've written about, and we continue to -- our forecast continues to pull away from those thresholds. So we're comfortable with where we are on the S&P metrics. 
The Moody's metrics are a little more challenging, as you know, because their cash flow from operations to debt, not including working capital. That is the sort of that 15% threshold, and that's what we've been really aiming for. And we still believe we're going to get there next year. In order to do that, we have to get past these cash flow items that we've experienced for the storms, some of the ones that I talked about this quarter, and we need to get the securitization. 
And ideally, we'll be able to do that off-sheet as well. And as I mentioned that legislation is moving forward in both Texas and Louisiana to do that. So I think we're actually in good shape to achieve all those objectives. 
In terms of the conversation with Moody's, I mean, obviously, you'll have to talk to them to get their perspective. But I think they understand what's going on, they understand that we have very good, solid mechanisms between fuel recovery, and with securitization. We have a history there, and they can see the results in the legislature going forward. So they're very comfortable that we are going to be able to make that progress. And they've actually written that they don't expect us to hit their target until 2023. So we're actually -- we're aiming to hit their target a year earlier than they would expect us to. 
So the conversations are going very well with them, I would say, because we just had our annual review, which isn't typically in the spring. And we have, as we've talked about, and we're talking about today, forecast, which should achieve our targeted objectives."

And now that we've gotten through all of our regulatory proceedings for the year, we think we're going to be able to manage that pretty well.

As you said, we've got RFPs for 1,000 megawatts outstanding right now. Our current thinking is that the renewable path would be about 2,500 megawatts by 2025, up to 5,000 by 2030. And I think the right way to think about it is we're trying to make a low-cost, reliable and sustainable footprint. 
And as we look going forward, as technology improves, as prices come down as battery storage gets more economical. That just makes the possibility for renewables to play a bigger part in the resource plan going forward, a reality, and that's what you've seen. 
And we evaluate resource plan on a regular basis. But we don't stop with the resource plan, we evaluate each individual product on a regular basis. And so as you know, we've got the Orange County Power and storage station that we'll -- that we're developing that on day 1, we'll have hydrogen capability and with -- being provided in the development space to be 100% hydrogen-capable at the point in time when that makes sense to the extent that gets accelerated that allows us to put more renewables into our footprint because we got that long-term storage flexibility. 
So when you think about our resource plan, we're just trying to meet the need that when you flip the switch, the lights come on. That's the need we got to meet. We want to do it as efficiently and cleanly as possible. And that just as technology has come to the point where that's a bigger and bigger renewable footprint. And again, if some of these other technologies are viable and cost effective, that really helps accelerate that renewable deployment as well. And so we continue to evaluate every project and every resource plan with those things in mind. 
So I'm excited about the possibility that the 5,000 gets bigger at some point. And we've got a lot of time between now and 2030 to make that happen. And with, again, the infrastructure support coming out of the policy environment, that only will tend to make that technology advance further, faster and be more economical for our customers if there's, again, that policy support."

It sounds like there's a pretty significant chance that we might get congressional action that would essentially extend the solar and wind tax credits for a very long time, creating a new energy storage tax credit, potentially provide more support for carbon capture and storage, and a few other things, hydrogen as well. 
I guess, first, just on the utility side, if you saw that kind of long-term federal support that really does change the economics meaningfully, would that trigger a, lets see, sort of a formal sort of reassessment of your resource planning across? Or is it more just opportunistic you'd sort of keep that in mind in the future? Or is it -- I'm trying to kind of think about whether that caused you to sort of immediately want to rethink some of the resource plans you already have?"

We're already rethinking the resource plan based on the potential for those kinds of initiatives to occur. As I mentioned, the resource plan, it's not like we said it, and then we just put it on autopilot, and we're going to follow through on it regardless of what happens. So we're already looking at the plan that we have, and determining based on different policy scenarios, what that might do to change the economics such that the plan itself has changed. 
And again, as I mentioned, the more support -- policy support for these technologies occur, the lower cost they are for our customers and the faster they're going to accelerate in terms of their development as vital. That's -- we see that as having a positive impact on the cost to the customers as well as the sustainability of the resource plan itself. 
So I mean, the short answer is, absolutely. We're already looking at what those impacts might be. And certainly, like everybody else in the industry, we're playing our part in helping the congressional leaders and the administrative leaders understand what those impacts might be on the industry, on Entergy, and on our region. 
And as I mentioned earlier, there's not only a growth opportunity for us in some of these policies, but -- the people who are making hydrogen today, Stephen, are in our service territory and are our customers. The people who are utilizing that hydrogen are in our service territory and are our customers. So it's our intention to work with them in helping them meet their sustainability goals and their sustainability requirements depending on what again comes out of legislation and administrative situation in Washington to help them with their sustainability objectives. So if you think about major hydrogen producers today through gas reformation, if they're going to have to get carbon capture or renewables, we want to be there to help them with that."

And actually, the last part of what you mentioned, Leo, kind of brings me to my second question, which was just on, I guess, especially hydrogen and carbon capture. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about sort of the role of Entergy in helping your customers. 
I guess I'm thinking about, frankly, degree of technology, risk you're willing to take, commodity risk. What sort of the range of possible roles that Entergy could have helping customers pursue those technologies? Would you mind just elaborating a little bit on that?"

Certainly, we're in the early phases of evaluating exactly what their needs are, what they want to do and what they can -- what their exposure is as well as how we want to participate. So we're really in the range of investigation right now. One is,",446,"Sure. Certainly, we're in the early phases of evaluating exactly what their needs are, what they want to do and what they can -- what their exposure is as well as how we want to participate. So we're really in the range of investigation right now. One is, for example, with our fleet itself, what we're going to utilize. The Montgomery County Innovation Center that I talked about. That is a 22-megawatt electrolysis facility that we're looking to develop, where we would be, obviously, creating green hydrogen that we would then test in our own facilities as we use that as a precursor up to then how Orange County is going to utilize green hydrogen in its own -- for the production of electricity. 
At the same point in time, to the extent carbon capture is something that a hydrogen producer might want to utilize our ability to provide them with economic renewables would be a way to obviously create new load and new renewables for us to be able to help them with that. And to the extent that they want to pursue electrolysis in their own production of green hydrogen, and we can provide the clean energy, whether it's through nuclear or through renewables, we can do that as well. So we're investigating all aspects of that. 
At the same point in time, there is transportation infrastructure down here in terms of pipelines and everything. For that, we need to look at how that transportation tees up to our own facilities as well as amongst the service territory. And then we've got storage facilities that are capable of being converted to store hydrogen. And so we're looking at that and what role that can play not only for us but for our customers. 
So there's a wide range of things that we're looking at. Obviously, our lane is to be the utility in all of this. And -- but as this progresses and we collaborate with Mitsubishi, and we collaborate with our customers, the opportunity to be a utility and provide the electricity for all of this to happen should be pretty significant if it all plays out. 
And I would say that the creation of the customer organization where we announced David Ellis' position within Rod's organization, that's going to be a pretty significant organization that we're developing, it's designed to help and collaborate with those customers on these new needs that they have. So I know that wasn't a specific list of projects, Stephen, but it's more of a pretty wide-ranging opportunity. We're going to stay in our lane, but yet, we're going to really pursue being able to make it reality."

So that is ongoing. I wouldn't say that, that's a significant amount of capital that would go into those facilities compared to the size of capital budget as it sits today. But certainly, we're looking at improving resiliency. And all of the investments that we're making in the normal capital plan are meant to improve power quality and reliability. And so as we do, for example, with our transmission system, all of the new stuff we build is to a higher standard than what we built 20 years ago. And as we saw in Hurricane Laura, all the stuff that we built with the new technology, which stood the hurricane. It was the stuff that we built 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago that was destroyed.

Our adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather. The underlying utility performance was strong, and our team successfully executed on multiple deliverables across the business. 
Our execution not only this year but over the last several years has resulted in strong growth and lower risk. This, in turn, has provided us more financial flexibility, which was most recently recognized by Moody's. 
The result is enhanced ability to manage risk and lower equity needs to fund our growth. The bottom line is, we are on track to deliver on our commitments, including our financial results. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2021 guidance as well as our longer-term financial outlooks and with added financial flexibility from our lower business risk profile, we expect to be in the top half of those ranges. 
Our 3-year $12 billion capital plan is the foundation. It is designed to deliver important benefits to our customers and will result in 5% to 7% adjusted EPS and dividend growth. Our capital investments will improve customer outcomes along several dimensions including reliability, resiliency, affordability and sustainability. Our plan also supports our expectation of at least 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030 delivering on our environmental stewardship commitments. 
There is a great deal of certainty around the execution of our plan as more than 90% of our investments today are tied to enhancing technology across our system to improve reliability and resiliency. 90% of our investments will be recovered through efficient and timely regulatory mechanisms such as FRPs and riders and 90% of these investments are ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint. 
Additionally, we were able to manage our costs to provide certainty to our stakeholders through both our flex spending program and continuous improvement. These initiatives allow us to manage our customers' bills and keep them affordable while also providing steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our owners. 
We have consistently maintained rates among the lowest in the country, and we have achieved 7% compound annual growth in adjusted EPS for 2016 to 2020. Our accomplishments so far this year keep us firmly on the path to meet our objectives. One important objective is increasing our renewable and clean energy resources. To that end, Entergy Texas began the process to seek approval to construct the Orange County advanced power station, a large-scale hydrogen capable facility that represents a significant milestone in our strategy to provide clean energy that also supports reliability. 
We received approval from the Arkansas Commission for the Walnut Bend Solar project. We will own this 100-megawatt facility, which is expected to be placed in service in 2022. It will provide clean energy for our customers in Arkansas and possibly provide capacity under a green tariff. We recently filed our proposed green promise tariff in Arkansas to allow for the sale of designated renewable energy to interested customers. 
Many customers have expressed interest in such an offer. And in fact, customers had input into the development of the proposal. We have received signed nonbinding letters of interest from 20 customers, including Walmart, a global technology company, a major retail pharmacy company nearly a dozen hospitals or hospital networks in Arkansas University and a number of large manufacturing customers. 
Our customers are telling us what they want, and we're listening. We're working to bring them offerings such as green promise to help them achieve their sustainability goals. We also continue to make progress on our annual FRPs which provide for timely recovery of investments that benefit customers.  Entergy Mississippi's FRP was approved and the full rates are in effect. And we submitted our annual filings in 3 jurisdictions: Arkansas, Louisiana and New Orleans. Many of you are interested in our strong recovery filing, they remain on track. Legislation to support off-balance sheet securitization past in Louisiana and Texas, and we expect to receive proceeds by mid-2022. 
In fact, Entergy Louisiana filed its request for securitization this past Friday. As I've mentioned before, building greater resiliency into our system is an ongoing focus. Some of our resiliency improvements have been occurring as normal course of business as we replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure with assets designed, the latest standards and able to handle higher wind loading or flood levels. 
At times, these resiliency improvements are accelerated likely we build back better after a major storm. However, we won't wait for another storm to continue to strengthen our system. We're conducting a review of our critical infrastructure, and we are developing long-term plans to continue this progress on the path to greater resiliency. 
Customer affordability continues to be a cornerstone of our plan. We're starting at a great place and looking ahead, even after accounting for storm recovery, we will still expect our rates to be well below the national average. And the annual growth rate for average bills from 2021 to 2024 is slightly above 2%. 
Bottom line,  so we have a solid plan with significant certainty and a strong growth outlook. We consistently execute on our key deliverables that underlie our commitments. We have a proven track record of delivering on those commitments. 
We're confident that we will be successful, but we're not stopping there. We aspire to do even better. Over the last several years, we've been highlighting the opportunity we see in customer solutions. We've begun to commercialize some of those solutions such as power through, our backup generator solution and shore power, the electrification of ships while imports. 
We're also developing other products to further electrification of industrial processes to accelerate the development of EV infrastructure. We're expanding our product and service offerings to help our C&I customers meet their sustainability objectives. 
We are actively working to reduce our carbon emissions, and that will help all of our customers reduce their Scope 2 emissions. To further support our customers' aggressive decarbonization goals, we will leverage green tariffs to provide carbon-free resources to further reduce their Scope 2 emissions. 
As you all know, Entergy has a large industrial base with about 40% of our demand coming from industrial customers. Some have viewed this as a risk, but we disagree. We see continued opportunity in this sector and here's why. Our industrial customers are efficient, diverse producers with infrastructure and labor competitive advantages. Our Gulf Coast refineries produce a wide variety of feedstocks and finished products highly integrated into the value chain. 
This is not going away. Even as products like cars evolve toward more sustainable options, the components of these products will still be needed. For example, cars and trucks will still have tires, frames and dashboards, all things created from feedstocks produced by Entergy's industrial customers. 
Additionally, in a carbon-constrained world, we see opportunity for additional growth in demand from our industrial customers. We talked about green tariffs as 1 way to help them meet sustainability goals, but that only addresses Scope 2 emissions that come from their power purchases.  The lion's share of our industrial carbon emissions come from Scope 1 emissions from fossil fuels that they use on site. 
Again, we're developing ways to help customers reduce their Scope 1 emissions through electrification, including electrification with green options. Substantial opportunity exists for us to help them electrify processes such as compression for LNG or product pipelines. Cogeneration, replacing a fossil fuel process with an electric alternative and processed to convert on-site broilers to electric heating. 
And as our customers adopt carbon capture utilization and storage, we can provide green energy to maximize the benefit of that technology. As we've discussed, Entergy's geographic positioning in the heart of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and consumers represents another unique opportunity. We have the ability to help our hydrogen customers, both producers and consumers convert to carbon-friendly hydrogen alternatives. The bottom line is that we believe our large industrial base gives Entergy a unique advantage and growth opportunity in a rapidly decarbonizing world. 
Turning our efforts -- to our efforts around hydrogen which we see as a clinical part of a clean energy future. We are working with Mitsubishi Power to advance technologies and expertise in hydrogen for the benefit of our customers. Part of our collaboration involves the hydrogen capable Orange County advanced power station, which I mentioned earlier. 
We're also continuing our work on Montgomery County Innovation Center, a 25-megawatt electrolysis facility to demonstrate green and clean hydrogen production capabilities. 
Finally, we recently participated in the DOE's Hydrogen Energy Earthshots initiative. Our goal is to secure federal funding to help jump-start hydrogen demonstration projects in our region in a matter that mitigates impacts on our customers' bills. 
We expect to see a request for proposal notice from the DOE later this year or early next year. At Entergy, we have a solid strategy to achieve our objectives. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We have one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets in the countries and we're working to make it even cleaner. 
We have a robust capital plan to meet our customers' evolving needs. Our low rates position us well. We're committed to continuous improvement for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have a clear line of sight to 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth, and we have a unique advantage with our customer base to provide sustainability solutions that could result in sales growth. 
Even with our excellent positioning today, our goal is to do more. These are exciting times, and we're working to create a very bright future for our company. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will review our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook."

As you can see on Slide 5, we have experienced robust sales as we recover from the impact of COVID-19. We continue to execute on our key deliverables. We're well on our way to achieving our goals for the year, and we are affirming our strong guidance and longer-term outlooks while pointing to the upper end of the range for each. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see the primary drivers for earnings in the quarter were straightforward. We continue to see the effects of our investments to improve customer outcomes, including rate changes to recover those investments. We also saw effects of the COVID-19 recovery. Sales were higher than last year despite negative weather in the quarter. 
Our industrial sales improved 7.1% year-over-year, driven by economic recovery and growth. Our industrial customers are now running at levels exceeding 2019. Commercial sales also are continuing to recover as businesses reopen and residential sales are beginning to taper as workers go back to their offices. 
On Slide 7, you'll see a little more detail on key sector indicators for our industrial customers. These 4 sectors collectively represent nearly half of our industrial sales. As you can see, the economic indicators are healthy and at or near multiyear high points. Inventories are back in alignment, commodity spreads have improved and volumes and margins are doing better across the board. 
Overall, our industrial base has rebounded nicely from the challenges of 2020. We are fortunate to have a resilient and competitively advantaged industrial base. Turning back to the earnings drivers. Our spending increased as we return to more normal business conditions. This increase is expected as we significantly reduced costs last year to offset the effects of COVID-19. 
The spending includes increased scope of work at our generating plants, including outages deferred from the past year. We also have incremental spending for new plants in service and in our focus areas of reliability and improving the customer experience. 
Our O&M expectation for the full year remains $2.7 billion, and we will continue to utilize our flexible spending tools to achieve steady predictable results. Moving to EWC on Slide 8, you'll see the results were lower than the prior year. The key driver was the sale of Indian Point to Holtec. The sale resulted in a pretax charge of $340 million, driven primarily by the nuclear decommissioning trust exceeding the decommissioning liability. 
The sale of Indian Point is a significant accomplishment and an important milestone in our exit of EWC and 1 which further improves our business risk profile, the impact of which I will address shortly. Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 9. The quarter's result is slightly higher than last year's operating cash flow returns to more normal levels. This change is due primarily to improved collections from customers, which are offset by a few items. 
Fuel prices increased compared to last year, and we saw a negative cash flow impact from the timing of fuel and purchase power cost recovery. Severance and retention payments were higher at EWC relating to the closure and sale of Indian Point. And we also had some remaining payments for noncapital 2020 storm costs. 
Our current credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt is 22.4% and our FFO to debt is 8.3%. Our FFO to debt remained suppressed in large part due to the financial impacts from storms. As we mentioned in the past few quarters, we expect the metric to return to targeted levels in 2022 after we receive securitization proceeds and pay down the incremental debt. 
We've made our storm recovery filings in Louisiana, Texas and New Orleans. As Leo noted, both Louisiana and Texas passed legislation to support off-balance sheet treatment for securitization. And last week, Entergy Louisiana made a securitization filing. Recovering storm costs through securitized debt is the best alternative for customers and help strengthen our balance sheet. 
As we communicated, we have several options to meet our equity needs. In this past quarter, we utilized the at-the-market equity program. As of the end of June, we had sold approximately $73 million of common stock, of which approximately 2/3 were forward sales, which could settle as late as next fall. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the Moody's advisory that was issued this past week. Though affirming SIRI's investment-grade ratings, Moody's did play a theory on negative outlook signing the currently pending cases filed against SIRI at FERC by Retail Utility Commissions. Moody's indicated that these cases have the potential to erode SIRI's earnings power and cost recovery. While we are, of course, disappointed by this change,  we recognize that the level of claims brought against SIRI approached the value of Grand Gulf. And the regulatory environment in which SIRI is operating is far from constructive. 
In the same advisory, Moody's affirmed the parent investment-grade rating and outlook recognizing that Entergy's larger size and diversity could withstand adverse outcomes at SIRI. In addition, Moody's recognized our improved business risk profile, which is a result of our successful multiyear strategy to wind down the EWC merchant business and grow our utility business. 
To do this, they reduced the cash flow from operations minus working capital to debt threshold. That's a bit of a mouthful for Entergy Corporation from 15% to 14%. We are pleased with the recognition of the derisking that we've accomplished in our business and combined with S&P's simpler recognition last fall. We are excited about the enhanced financial flexibility that our work is unlocked. 
Moving to Slide 11. The recent recognition of our derisking efforts and incremental balance sheet capacity, we are early in the process of determining its full impact on our plans and outlooks. That said, there are some early takeaways. First, the incremental capacity significantly increases our confidence in our ability to execute the current business plan. 
Second, we will not need as much equity to fund our utility growth. While we are affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth. The combination of the improved confidence and lower equity needs places us in the top half of our guidance and outlook ranges. 
We have a clear line of sight on our capital plans to benefit customers and a robust balance sheet to support that investment, both underpinned by a strong continuous improvement program and disciplined flexible spending plans. We plan to invest for the benefit of our customers and projects designed to improve reliability, sustainability, resiliency and customer experience. 
These investments and programs further support community economic development and employee development, all while keeping our focus on low rates. Finally, the incremental balance sheet capacity resulting from our derisking efforts will enhance our ability to unlock the significant investment opportunities that will flow from working alongside our commercial and industrial customers that Leo described to help them lower their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
Today, we are executing on our key deliverables, and we are firmly on track to meet or exceed our financial objectives. We are investing in customer solutions to enhance our customers' experience and our investments in renewables and hydrogen technology will continue to support our sustainability efforts and those of our customers to provide new opportunities in the future. 
We are very excited about the growth opportunities ahead. And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

We have been working on this a long time, but we just got the recognition from Moody's in the past week or so, as I mentioned. And so we are still early in the assessment of what the overall impact means I pointed to a couple of the early elements associated with it. 
We expect to complete that this fall. It could be sooner. I would say probably no later than EEI, but it could be sooner than that. And as it relates to something like the share count or specifics around size, I don't have those kinds of details available to give you today. Other than to say, we believe it would be meaningful. It will be a meaningful change. In terms of the evaluation, which is I think part of the question that you had in there, we still want to make sure that we are hitting our earnings and credit expectations. We will still need to issue a little bit of equity to do that. But the opportunity is much more robust in front of us now. We think it's been significantly derisked. We have a lot more confidence, as I said, in our ability to execute. And -- but we don't have specifics that we can give you today. A couple of other sizing or, I should say, a valuation perspective. One is that, as Leo talked about extensively, we have a significant growth opportunity ahead of us, and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to invest into that opportunity as it materializes. And then Moody's specifically also talked about SIRI and our ability to manage that risk as it's presented right now, specifically around the uncertain tax position case. 
And their perspective was that we should be able to manage that risk and still meet the expectations around earnings and credit. And so we want to make sure that we have that capacity built in as well. And of course, we still believe that we're going to be successful in Siri. I know that wasn't really your question, but if that doesn't materialize, that would be incremental opportunity for us to invest in the business."

And when you go from 15% to 14%, given the size of our cash flow, it's somewhere in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range, and it's sort of growing over time. So it's a lot of extra capacity. The -- and what we are considering in terms of the building blocks, I think, as I mentioned, I think there's probably 3 big ones, right? One is, okay, so how much incremental equity we really need right now. That will take up some of that capacity. 
One is how much opportunity is really out there for growth in the commercial and industrial space as we ramp up our ability to work alongside our customers to manage their Scope 1 and Scope 2 positions. Those are probably the 2 big ones. 
Then Moody's specifically talked about our ability to manage identifiable risks that are out there. And they pointed to SIRI specifically. And if you take the ALJ's recommendation around uncertain tax position. That's in the ballpark of a little over $500 million. That could be a piece of capacity as well. Certainly, we're very comfortable in the way that we are positioned in that case, and we can go through that, and we have in the past, as you know. So I mean I think it's -- that is additional something that we're thinking about as well, make sure that we have the capacity to manage a risk like that, and that Moody's was pointing at that. So I mean, those are the 3 things. We certainly had a forecast before this ruling last week that said we were going to hit our earnings expectations. We were going to hit our targets on credit, though there still the case. Now we have extra capacity to do that and manage through these new opportunities and these risks.

There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing",552,"So Steve, that's a good question. There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing resiliency across the system, which could lead to more T&D investment going forward. 
So that's an area that I did want to point out, the assessment of that in conjunction with what's going on with infrastructure in Washington could be a combination of rate base assets -- some costs that are actually picked up by the states and the federal government through potentially the infrastructure build, depending on how that all works out. 
The big opportunity to -- and we've been talking about this for a while, obviously, is the size of the emissions footprint of our industrial base. And if you just go on the Internet, look at who our industrial customers are and look at their websites, they all have sustainability objectives that many of which are public. And so there's a couple of ways for us to help them out. One, what we already do when they buy electricity from us, it's some of the cleanest electricity in the country. So their scope 2 emissions are lower. To drive those even lower, we've been discussing things like green tariffs with those customers. And that really makes the deployment of our renewables more efficient. And so for example, we got the solar facility that we got approval for in Arkansas filing a green tariff in Arkansas. We are, and you have customers like Walmart in to talk to us about taking a slice of those facilities to make the deployment of those more efficient in a way that could accelerate our investment in renewables, if there's a large uptake of that, particularly if that spreads over into our industrial customers, which we're already having discussions with them on that. 
Then the big opportunity is exactly what you said, is to attack their Scope 1 emissions and that really is again, outside of just merely adding generation to the system for technological improvement, now we would be adding load growth. And so you can think about it as it's new load with new sales for new processes that today are not electrified, that would provide us the opportunity to deploy assets to help them meet those objectives. And primarily, that could not only accelerate, but increase the size of our renewable footprint going forward. We're in the early stage of the size and timing of that. So we'll be laying out more as we go, but it would be rate base additions to meet regulated utility sales for things like they're using natural gas compression on a pipeline today, electrifying that and we're using fossil fuels to further pricing in LNG process that can be electrified. If they're cogenerating with highly inefficient and high emitting generation on site today, that could be electrified by us or utilizing green tariffs or to the extent that we develop hydrogen over time, but that can be a part of the mix as well. So it's a pretty significant opportunity that we're in the early stages of investigating. We're having a lot of discussions with our customers about what their needs are."

When we electrify that ship, we not only reduce our emissions, which was the original discussion around it, but it does lower their cost because the trade from our electricity to diesel fuel is a positive one. So it does 2 things for them. It lowers their cost and it improves their emissions, both of which make them more competitive as they bid for offshore work.

I'm happy to report another solid quarter. Our adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather.

Our adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather. The underlying utility performance was strong, and our team successfully executed on multiple deliverables across the business. 
Our execution not only this year but over the last several years has resulted in strong growth and lower risk. This, in turn, has provided us more financial flexibility, which was most recently recognized by Moody's. 
The result is enhanced ability to manage risk and lower equity needs to fund our growth. The bottom line is, we are on track to deliver on our commitments, including our financial results. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2021 guidance as well as our longer-term financial outlooks and with added financial flexibility from our lower business risk profile, we expect to be in the top half of those ranges. 
Our 3-year $12 billion capital plan is the foundation. It is designed to deliver important benefits to our customers and will result in 5% to 7% adjusted EPS and dividend growth. Our capital investments will improve customer outcomes along several dimensions including reliability, resiliency, affordability and sustainability. Our plan also supports our expectation of at least 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030 delivering on our environmental stewardship commitments. 
There is a great deal of certainty around the execution of our plan as more than 90% of our investments today are tied to enhancing technology across our system to improve reliability and resiliency. 90% of our investments will be recovered through efficient and timely regulatory mechanisms such as FRPs and riders and 90% of these investments are ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint. 
Additionally, we were able to manage our costs to provide certainty to our stakeholders through both our flex spending program and continuous improvement. These initiatives allow us to manage our customers' bills and keep them affordable while also providing steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our owners. 
We have consistently maintained rates among the lowest in the country, and we have achieved 7% compound annual growth in adjusted EPS for 2016 to 2020. Our accomplishments so far this year keep us firmly on the path to meet our objectives. One important objective is increasing our renewable and clean energy resources. To that end, Entergy Texas began the process to seek approval to construct the Orange County Advanced Power Station, a large-scale hydrogen capable facility that represents a significant milestone in our strategy to provide clean energy that also supports reliability. 
We received approval from the Arkansas Commission for the Walnut Bend Solar project. We will own this 100-megawatt facility, which is expected to be placed in service in 2022. It will provide clean energy for our customers in Arkansas and possibly provide capacity under a green tariff. We recently filed our proposed green promise tariff in Arkansas to allow for the sale of designated renewable energy to interested customers. 
Many customers have expressed interest in such an offer. And in fact, customers had input into the development of the proposal. We have received signed nonbinding letters of interest from 20 customers, including Walmart, a global technology company, a major retail pharmacy company, nearly a dozen hospitals or hospital networks and Arkansas University and a number of large manufacturing customers. 
Our customers are telling us what they want, and we're listening. We're working to bring them offerings such as green promise to help them achieve their sustainability goals. We also continue to make progress on our annual FRPs, which provide for timely recovery of investments that benefit customers.  Entergy Mississippi's FRP was approved and the full rates are in effect. And we submitted our annual filings in 3 jurisdictions: Arkansas, Louisiana and New Orleans. Many of you are interested in our strong recovery filing, they remain on track. Legislation to support off-balance sheet securitization past in Louisiana and Texas, and we expect to receive proceeds by mid 2022.  In fact, Entergy Louisiana filed its request for securitization this past Friday. 
As I've mentioned before, building greater resiliency into our system is an ongoing focus. Some of our resiliency improvements have been occurring as normal course of business as we replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure with assets designed, the latest standards and able to handle higher wind loading or flood levels. 
At times, these resiliency improvements are accelerated likely we build back better after a major storm. However, we won't wait for another storm to continue to strengthen our system. We're conducting a review of our critical infrastructure, and we are developing long-term plans to continue this progress on the path to greater resiliency. 
Customer affordability continues to be a cornerstone of our plan. We're starting at a great place and looking ahead, even after accounting for storm recovery, we will still expect our rates to be well below the national average. And the annual growth rate for average bills from 2021 to 2024 is slightly above 2%. 
Bottom line,  so we have a solid plan with significant certainty and a strong growth outlook. We consistently execute on our key deliverables that underlie our commitments. We have a proven track record of delivering on those commitments. 
We're confident that we will be successful, but we're not stopping there. We aspire to do even better. Over the last several years, we've been highlighting the opportunity we see in customer solutions. We've begun to commercialize some of those solutions such as power through, our backup generator solution and shore power, the electrification of ships while imports. 
We're also developing other products to further electrification of industrial processes to accelerate the development of EV infrastructure. We're expanding our product and service offerings to help our C&I customers meet their sustainability objectives. 
We are actively working to reduce our carbon emissions, and that will help all of our customers reduce their Scope 2 emissions. To further support our customers' aggressive decarbonization goals, we will leverage green tariffs to provide carbon-free resources to further reduce their Scope 2 emissions. 
As you all know, Entergy has a large industrial base with about 40% of our demand coming from industrial customers. Some have viewed this as a risk, but we disagree. We see continued opportunity in this sector and here's why. Our industrial customers are efficient, diverse producers with infrastructure and labor competitive advantages. Our Gulf Coast refineries produce a wide variety of feedstocks and finished products highly integrated into the value chain. 
This is not going away. Even as products like cars evolve toward more sustainable options, the components of these products will still be needed. For example, cars and trucks will still have tires, frames and dashboards, all things created from feedstocks produced by Entergy's industrial customers. 
Additionally, in a carbon-constrained world, we see opportunity for additional growth in demand from our industrial customers. We talked about green tariffs as 1 way to help them meet sustainability goals, but that only addresses Scope 2 emissions that come from their power purchases.  The lion's share of our industrial carbon emissions come from Scope 1 emissions from fossil fuels that they use on site. 
Again, we're developing ways to help customers reduce their Scope 1 emissions through electrification, including electrification with green options. Substantial opportunity exists for us to help them electrify processes such as compression for LNG or product pipelines. Cogeneration, replacing a fossil fuel process with an electric alternative and processed to convert on-site boilers to electric heating. 
And as our customers adopt carbon capture utilization and storage, we can provide green energy to maximize the benefit of that technology. As we've discussed, Entergy's geographic positioning in the heart of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and consumers represents another unique opportunity. We have the ability to help our hydrogen customers, both producers and consumers convert to carbon-friendly hydrogen alternatives. The bottom line is that we believe our large industrial base gives Entergy a unique advantage and growth opportunity in a rapidly decarbonizing world. 
Turning our efforts -- to our efforts around hydrogen which we see as a clinical part of a clean energy future. We are working with Mitsubishi Power to advance technologies and expertise in hydrogen for the benefit of our customers. Part of our collaboration involves the hydrogen capable Orange County Advanced Power Station, which I mentioned earlier. 
We're also continuing our work on Montgomery County Innovation Center, a 25-megawatt electrolysis facility to demonstrate green and clean hydrogen production capabilities. 
Finally, we recently participated in the DOE's Hydrogen Energy Earthshots initiative. Our goal is to secure federal funding to help jump-start hydrogen demonstration projects in our region in a matter that mitigates impacts on our customers' bills.  We expect to see a request for proposal notice from the DOE later this year or early next year. 
At Entergy, we have a solid strategy to achieve our objectives. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We have one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets in the countries and we're working to make it even cleaner. 
We have a robust capital plan to meet our customers' evolving needs. Our low rates position us well. We're committed to continuous improvement for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have a clear line of sight to 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth, and we have a unique advantage with our customer base to provide sustainability solutions that could result in sales growth. 
Even with our excellent positioning today, our goal is to do more. These are exciting times, and we're working to create a very bright future for our company. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will review our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook."

We continue to execute on our key deliverables. We'",1259,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting results for another solid quarter. As you can see on Slide 5, we have experienced robust sales as we recovered from the impact of COVID-19. We continue to execute on our key deliverables. We're well on our way to achieving our goals for the year, and we are affirming our strong guidance and longer-term outlooks while pointing to the upper end of the range for each. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see the primary drivers for earnings in the quarter were straightforward. We continue to see the effects of our investments to improve customer outcomes, including rate changes to recover those investments. We also saw effects of the COVID-19 recovery. Sales were higher than last year despite negative weather in the quarter. 
Our industrial sales improved 7.1% year-over-year, driven by economic recovery and growth. Our industrial customers are now running at levels exceeding 2019. Commercial sales also are continuing to recover as businesses reopen and residential sales are beginning to taper as workers go back to their offices. 
On Slide 7, you'll see a little more detail on key sector indicators for our industrial customers. These 4 sectors collectively represent nearly half of our industrial sales. As you can see, the economic indicators are healthy and at or near multiyear high points. Inventories are back in alignment, commodity spreads have improved and volumes and margins are doing better across the board. 
Overall, our industrial base has rebounded nicely from the challenges of 2020. We are fortunate to have a resilient and competitively advantaged industrial base. Turning back to the earnings drivers. Our spending increased as we return to more normal business conditions. This increase is expected as we significantly reduced costs last year to offset the effects of COVID-19. 
The spending includes increased scope of work at our generating plants, including outages deferred from the past year. We also have incremental spending for new plants in service and in our focus areas of reliability and improving the customer experience. 
Our O&M expectation for the full year remains $2.7 billion, and we will continue to utilize our flexible spending tools to achieve steady predictable results. 
Moving to EWC on Slide 8, you'll see the results were lower than the prior year. The key driver was the sale of Indian Point to Holtec. The sale resulted in a pretax charge of $340 million, driven primarily by the nuclear decommissioning trust exceeding the decommissioning liability. 
The sale of Indian Point is a significant accomplishment and an important milestone in our exit of EWC and 1 which further improves our business risk profile, the impact of which I will address shortly. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 9. The quarter's result is slightly higher than last year's operating cash flow returns to more normal levels. This change is due primarily to improved collections from customers, which are offset by a few items. 
Fuel prices increased compared to last year, and we saw a negative cash flow impact from the timing of fuel and purchase power cost recovery. Severance and retention payments were higher at EWC relating to the closure and sale of Indian Point. And we also had some remaining payments for noncapital 2020 storm costs. 
Our current credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt is 22.4% and our FFO to debt is 8.3%. Our FFO to debt remained suppressed in large part due to the financial impacts from storms. As we mentioned in the past few quarters, we expect the metric to return to targeted levels in 2022 after we receive securitization proceeds and pay down the incremental debt. 
We've made our storm recovery filings in Louisiana, Texas and New Orleans. As Leo noted, both Louisiana and Texas passed legislation to support off-balance sheet treatment for securitization. And last week, Entergy Louisiana made a securitization filing. Recovering storm costs through securitized debt is the best alternative for customers and help strengthen our balance sheet. 
As we communicated, we have several options to meet our equity needs. In this past quarter, we utilized the at-the-market equity program. As of the end of June, we had sold approximately $73 million of common stock, of which approximately 2/3 were forward sales, which could settle as late as next fall. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the Moody's advisory that was issued this past week. Though affirming SIRI's investment-grade ratings, Moody's did play a theory on negative outlook signing the currently pending cases filed against SIRI at FERC by Retail Utility Commissions. Moody's indicated that these cases have the potential to erode SIRI's earnings power and cost recovery. While we are, of course, disappointed by this change, we recognize that the level of claims brought against SIRI approached the value of Grand Gulf. And the regulatory environment in which SIRI is operating is far from constructive. 
In the same advisory, Moody's affirmed the parent investment-grade rating and outlook recognizing that Entergy's larger size and diversity could withstand adverse outcomes at SIRI. In addition, Moody's recognized our improved business risk profile, which is a result of our successful multiyear strategy to wind down the EWC merchant business and grow our utility business. 
To do this, they reduced the cash flow from operations minus working capital to debt threshold. That's a bit of a mouthful for Entergy Corporation from 15% to 14%. We are pleased with the recognition of the derisking that we've accomplished in our business and combined with S&P's simpler recognition last fall. We are excited about the enhanced financial flexibility that our work is unlocked. 
Moving to Slide 11. The recent recognition of our derisking efforts and incremental balance sheet capacity, we are early in the process of determining its full impact on our plans and outlooks. That said, there are some early takeaways. First, the incremental capacity significantly increases our confidence in our ability to execute the current business plan. 
Second, we will not need as much equity to fund our utility growth. While we are affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth. The combination of the improved confidence and lower equity needs places us in the top half of our guidance and outlook ranges. 
We have a clear line of sight on our capital plans to benefit customers and a robust balance sheet to support that investment, both underpinned by a strong continuous improvement program and disciplined flexible spending plans. We plan to invest for the benefit of our customers and projects designed to improve reliability, sustainability, resiliency and customer experience. 
These investments and programs further support community economic development and employee development, all while keeping our focus on low rates. Finally, the incremental balance sheet capacity resulting from our derisking efforts will enhance our ability to unlock the significant investment opportunities that will flow from working alongside our commercial and industrial customers that Leo described to help them lower their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
Today, we are executing on our key deliverables, and we are firmly on track to meet or exceed our financial objectives. We are investing in customer solutions to enhance our customers' experience and our investments in renewables and hydrogen technology will continue to support our sustainability efforts and those of our customers to provide new opportunities in the future. 
We are very excited about the growth opportunities ahead. And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

We have been working on this a long time, but we just got the recognition from Moody's in the past week or so, as I mentioned. And so we are still early in the assessment of what the overall impact means I pointed to a couple of the early elements associated with it. 
We expect to complete that this fall. It could be sooner. I would say probably no later than EEI, but it could be sooner than that. And as it relates to something like the share count or specifics around size, I don't have those kinds of details available to give you today. Other than to say, we believe it would be meaningful. It will be a meaningful change. In terms of the evaluation, which is I think part of the question that you had in there, we still want to make sure that we are hitting our earnings and credit expectations. We will still need to issue a little bit of equity to do that. But the opportunity is much more robust in front of us now. We think it's been significantly derisked. We have a lot more confidence, as I said, in our ability to execute. And -- but we don't have specifics that we can give you today. 
A couple of other sizing or, I should say, valuation perspectives. One is that, as Leo talked about extensively, we have a significant growth opportunity ahead of us, and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to invest into that opportunity as it materializes. And then Moody's specifically also talked about SIRI and our ability to manage that risk as it's presented right now, specifically around the uncertain tax position case. 
And their perspective was that we should be able to manage that risk and still meet the expectations around earnings and credit. And so we want to make sure that we have that capacity built in as well. And of course, we still believe that we're going to be successful in SIRI. I know that wasn't really your question, but if that doesn't materialize, that would be incremental opportunity for us to invest in the business."

And when you go from 15% to 14%, given the size of our cash flow, it's somewhere in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range, and it's sort of growing over time. So it's a lot of extra capacity. The -- and what we are considering in terms of the building blocks, I think, as I mentioned, I think there's probably 3 big ones, right? One is, okay, so how much incremental equity we really need right now. That will take up some of that capacity. 
One is how much opportunity is really out there for growth in the commercial and industrial space as we ramp up our ability to work alongside our customers to manage their Scope 1 and Scope 2 positions. Those are probably the 2 big ones. 
Then Moody's specifically talked about our ability to manage identifiable risks that are out there. And they pointed to SIRI specifically. And if you take the ALJ's recommendation around uncertain tax position. That's in the ballpark of a little over $500 million. That could be a piece of capacity as well. Certainly, we're very comfortable in the way that we are positioned in that case, and we can go through that, and we have in the past, as you know. So I mean I think it's -- that is additional something that we're thinking about as well, make sure that we have the capacity to manage a risk like that, and that Moody's was pointing at that. So I mean, those are the 3 things. 
We certainly had a forecast before this ruling last week that said we were going to hit our earnings expectations. We were going to hit our targets on credit, though there still the case. Now we have extra capacity to do that and manage through these new opportunities and these risks. So it's incrementally better for us because it really derisks our ability to execute."

There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing",553,"So Steve, that's a good question. There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing resiliency across the system, which could lead to more T&D investment going forward. 
So that's an area that I did want to point out, the assessment of that in conjunction with what's going on with infrastructure in Washington could be a combination of rate base assets -- some costs that are actually picked up by the states and the federal government through potentially the infrastructure build, depending on how that all works out. 
The big opportunity to -- and we've been talking about this for a while, obviously, is the size of the emissions footprint of our industrial base. And if you just go on the Internet, look at who our industrial customers are and look at their websites, they all have sustainability objectives that many of which are public. And so there's a couple of ways for us to help them out. One, what we already do when they buy electricity from us, it's some of the cleanest electricity in the country. So their Scope 2 emissions are lower. To drive those even lower, we've been discussing things like green tariffs with those customers. And that really makes the deployment of our renewables more efficient. 
And so for example, we got the solar facility that we got approval for in Arkansas filing a green tariff in Arkansas. We already have customers like Walmart who are in to talk to us about taking a slice of those facilities to make the deployment of those more efficient in a way that could accelerate our investment in renewables, if there's a large uptake of that, particularly if that spreads over into our industrial customers, which we're already having discussions with them on that. 
Then the big opportunity is exactly what you said, is to attack their Scope 1 emissions and that really is again, outside of just merely adding generation to the system for technological improvement, now we would be adding toward load growth. And so you can think about it as it's new load with new sales for new processes that today are not electrified, that would provide us the opportunity to deploy assets to help them meet those objectives. And primarily, that could not only accelerate, but increase the size of our renewable footprint going forward. 
We're in the early stage of the size and timing of that. So we'll be laying out more as we go, but it would be rate base additions to meet regulated utility sales for things like they're using natural gas compression on a pipeline today, electrifying that and we're using fossil fuels to further pricing in LNG process that can be electrified. If they're cogenerating with highly inefficient and high emitting generation on site today, that could be electrified by us or utilizing green tariffs or to the extent that we develop hydrogen over time, but that can be a part of the mix as well. So it's a pretty significant opportunity that we're in the early stages of investigating. We're having a lot of discussions with our customers about what their needs are."

When we electrify that ship, we not only reduce our emissions, which was the original discussion around it, but it does lower their cost because the trade from our electricity to diesel fuel is a positive one. So it does 2 things for them. It lowers their cost and it improves their emissions, both of which make them more competitive as they bid for offshore work.

Today, we are reporting quarterly results that keep us firmly on track to meet our financial commitments. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.45 per share. With good visibility into the rest of the year, we",1488,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting quarterly results that keep us firmly on track to meet our financial commitments. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.45 per share. With good visibility into the rest of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 guidance range and $5.90 through $6.10 per share and expect to achieve 2022 and 2023 results in line with our outlook. 
Further, we are extending our outlooks to include 2024 and see our steady predictable growth of 5% to 7% continuing through this period. Additionally, we achieved the milestone of raising our dividend by 6% and aligning with our earnings growth. This happened on the schedule we previously communicated and represents another commitment met. We have developed a more resilient business. And despite $65 million of nonfuel revenue losses in the third quarter due to Hurricane Ida. We are maintaining our financial commitments. 
Our resiliency provides stability that is valuable to all of our stakeholders, particularly customers and owners. The quarter was heavily impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall as a strong category for hurricane bringing powerful destructive wins across New Orleans, Baton Rouge and beyond. Our coastal communities were particularly hard hit by both strong winds and storm surge. Ida disrupted the lives and businesses of many of our customers and communities and Entergy was there to help when they needed us. 
We gathered a restoration force of 27,000, our largest ever, representing Entergy employees, contractors and mutual assistance crews from 41 states across the country. I would like to take a moment to personally thank our employees and the crews who answered the call to come help restore power to our impacted customers. Further gratitude goes to our employees who worked restoration despite their own homes being damaged by Ida. 
They epitomize what it means to put our customers first. I never cease to be amazed by the dedication and effectiveness of the many restoration workers who step away from their lives for weeks at a time to help our customers and communities get their lives and livelihoods back up and running again. Despite Ida's wins creating significant damage and destruction across our power grid with close to 1 million peak outages, our team restored customers at a rapid pace. In just over a week, we had roughly half of all customers restored. 
Metro areas like New Orleans and Baton Rouge saw restoration essentially completed by day 10. Within 3 weeks, more than 98% of all affected customers were restored. And it's easy to lose sight of the fact that this restoration was successfully accomplished while dealing with the effects of the pandemic. Entergy also helped our customers and communities throughout the recovery process by developing of deploying 165 commercial scale generators to power critical community infrastructure like medical facilities, gas stations, grocery stores, municipal water systems and community cooling centers in advance of power being restored. 
In addition to restoration work, Entergy's employees contributed countless hours to their communities and Entergy shareholders committed $1.25 million help affected communities rebuild and recover. While power has been restored to customers who can safely take it, our job is not finished. We are committed to minimizing the effects of Ida on our customers' bills. 
We will work with our regulators to seek securitization of Ida storm costs, which is a proven and low-cost means of recovery. Further, we are coordinating with key officials and stakeholders, including Louisiana Governor Edwards, The City Council of New Orleans, Louisiana Public Service Commission, Louisiana Congressional Delegation and the Biden administration to seek federal support that could offset the cost of our customers for Ida in the 2020 storms. 
There is widespread alignment among state and local leaders on the compelling case that Louisiana has to obtain federal support. We are fully aligned with this perspective. To be clear, any federal funding that energy utilities obtain will reduce the customer obligation dollar for dollar. We're also committed to mitigating the impacts of future storms. Entergy has made significant transmission and distribution investments, nearly $10 billion over the last 5 years, which made our system more resilient. 
We've seen those new investments perform well under the most challenging conditions. Wind damage to our transmission structures, for example, has occurred most almost exclusively to older structures built to prior standards. It has become clear that major weather events of all types are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. 
Hurricane Laura made landfall as the strongest storm hit the Louisiana Coast since 1856. Then exactly 12 months later, Hurricane Ida hit with almost equal force. Our resilient standards and asset programs have never been static, and we've continued to evolve them. And as I mentioned, our investments are working as designed. 
However, the uptick in severity and frequency of storms is compelling us to take a fresh look at how we can make our system more resilient, including the pace at which we can achieve it. Even prior to Ida, we are actively deploying multiple options along the resiliency scale, particularly for our service areas south of I10 and I12, which has the greatest exposure to hurricane strength winds and flooding. 
Evaluating these resiliency options needs to be done under future climate scenarios. And we are taking into account important considerations such as customer affordability and sufficiency of materials and skilled labor. This customer-driven investment will be significant, and we will work collaboratively with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the optimal path forward. 
Coming back to the quarter, I would like to highlight that despite dealing with a major storm, the business continued to run well without missing a beat. We've made great progress in several open proceedings. First, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement for its formula rate plan, and the Arkansas Commission has agreed to cancel the hearing and take up the settlement based on the filed testimony, which is positive. 
New rates in Arkansas will be implemented in January. In New Orleans, we recently implemented rates at the level that reflected all adjustments proposed by the council's advisers so there are no further proceedings there. We also are pleased to note that Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement with key customers of its green promise tariff filing. If approved, this tariff will enable us to offer green solutions to meet the growing sustainability demands of our customers. 
And we're making progress on other open proceedings. In Entergy Louisiana, its FRP rates went into effect. Entergy Arkansas received approval for the West Memphis solar project. Entergy Texas reached an unopposed settlement on its 2020 storm cost filing. Entergy Texas also filed for approval of the Orange County Advanced Power Station. In the Louisiana 2020 storm recovery and securitization process remains on track. 
We continue to make progress on decarbonizing our fleet. We've announced 5 gigawatts of solar in our supply plan through 2030 with a goal of doing more. And an update to our supply plan and renewables growth will be provided next week at EEI. In addition to healthy meeting -- in addition to helping meet decarbonization goals, the cost of renewable resources relative to conventional resources continues to trend favorably, and renewable resources provided an important edge against rising and volatile natural gas prices. 
We will provide more details around our latest resource plans at EEI. Last quarter, I discussed ways in which Entergy can help our industrial customers meet their sustainability goals. While many have expressed long-term goals like net-zero by 2050 even more have developed shorter-term interim goals that will require action by the end of the decade. 
Clean electrification is one of several important tools that our industrial customers have as a means to achieve their objectives. Clean electrification provides a great opportunity for load growth and will require significant capital investment in renewable generation, transmission and distribution. 
The load growth that comes with electrification will help pay for incremental customer-centric investments. We'll have more to discuss regarding the opportunity we have to help our customers meet their sustainability objectives next week at EEI. While it is important to discuss these longer-term growth opportunities, I want to make sure we don't lose sight of the very solid based investment plan that we have in front of us. 
Over the next 3 years, we have a $12 billion capital plan that is designed to deliver reliability, resilience, improve customer experience and environmental and cost efficiency benefits to our customers. When paired with our well-defined regulatory constructs, our plan will deliver 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth for our owners over the next 3 years. That's a very solid base plan. 
And beyond this strong foundation, these other opportunities in renewable generation, clean electrification and resilience acceleration will serve to extend our runway of growth throughout the rest of the decade. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you at the EEI Financial Conference. 
Now Drew will review the quarterly results."

Summarized on Slide 5, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, slightly higher than a year ago. We continue to execute our strategy, and we are firmly on track to meet our commitments. In fact, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are narrowing our guidance range to $5.90 to $6.10. We're also affirming our outlook and extending the outlook period through 2024, and we recently raised our dividend to align with our adjusted EPS growth rate. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our investments to improve customer outcomes continue to drive growth. That includes rate changes to recover those investments as well as associated new operating expenses. Industrial build sales were 10% stronger than a year ago. We saw increases across most segments with the largest increases in primary metals, petrochemicals, transportation, industrial gases and chlor-alkali. 
This reaffirms the strength of our industrial customer base. And in a world with supply chain constraints and higher energy prices, our industrial customers' businesses remain strong and competitive. These industrial sales were strong despite Hurricane Ida. 
Overall, across all classes, we estimate that third quarter revenues were approximately $65 million lower as a result of Ida. Hurricane Laura's impact on third quarter 2020 was approximately half of that. Other O&M was higher this quarter as planned. This is partly due to higher costs for distribution operations, including reliability costs, higher expenses in our power generation function and higher health and benefit costs. 
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. You'll see results were slightly lower than a year ago. The key driver was the shutdown and sale of Indian Point. Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 8. The quarter's result is about $300 million higher than last year. The increase is due largely to improved collections from customers, including collections associated with investments to benefit customers and Winter Storm Uri. This was partially offset by expenditures related to higher natural gas prices. 
Slide 9 summarizes our credit and liquidity. We expect to maintain our current credit ratings, and we continue to expect to achieve targeted rating agency credit metrics as storm restoration spending is securitized and we retire storm-related debt. I'll take a minute to discuss our balance sheet, beginning with a quick update on Hurricane Ida on Slide 10. 
Over the past several weeks, we've refined our cost estimates, and we've shaved $100 million off the upper end of the range. The total cost is now expected to be $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. We've also updated our estimate of the nonfuel revenue loss to $75 million to $80 million, the lower half of our previous range. While our net liquidity, including storm reserves remained strong at $4 billion, we are also working to ensure timely storm cost recovery. That starts with a successful restoration effort and proceeds through 2 avenues. 
First, interview Louisiana amended its 2020 storm filing to request an additional $1 billion to provide early liquidity for Hurricane Ida costs. And in Texas, we reached a settlement on the 2020 storm cost filing and that is now before the PUCT. Second, we have improved the efficiency of our storm invoice processing to accelerate our filings and ultimately, cost recovery. 
We plan to complete financing for the 2020 storms by early next year and Ida by the end of next year. Our work isn't over, we'll continue to identify ways to further reduce business risk. As Leo highlighted, we are looking forward to a conversation with our customers, retail regulators and other stakeholders about how we best accelerate and implement a strong resilience plan. 
We have already hardened more than half of our critical transmission and distribution structures along the Gulf Coast to standards implemented after Katrina and Rita. Continue to move the bar higher by reevaluating current standards using the latest weather data. In addition, a comprehensive resilience plan needs to include the strategic placement of assets to allow higher-risk communities to recover more quickly. 
For example, MicroGrid Distributed Energy Resources and the deployment of generators, Leo highlighted to certain critical customers and the aftermath of storms could be very helpful in supporting communities as they recover go into more depth on this in our conversations with EEI. 
In addition to physical resilience, our regulators know the importance of a healthy credit at the operating companies to support customers. And they have put in place time-tested cost recovery mechanisms such as securitization and storm reserves to support that need. We are fortunate that in looking to recover the 2020 and 2021 storm costs, we are starting with some of the lowest rates in the country. 
We have significant electrification growth potential that could help pay for incremental customer-centric investments and future storm costs. All of these will support our credit as our regulators and key stakeholders aligned with us around a strong, resilient acceleration plan. 
In addition, we continue to execute on the exit of EWC, and we're less than a year from completing our plan. The resulting improvements were recognized by S&P last fall through our improved business risk profile and by Moody's, just this past quarter through changes to our rating thresholds. Those changes remain in place and our ratings reflect future storm risk. As a result, we were able to reduce our 2021 to 2024 equity need. Combined with our ATM transactions, our future equity need is more than 50% lower than the $2.5 billion communicated at Analyst Day last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. We have a clear line of sight on the remainder of the year. And for the third year in a row, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance. In this case, for 2021 to $5.90 to $6.10. We are also affirming our longer-term outlook of 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth and extending the 2024. Our confidence in our solid base plan continues to grow a key expression of that confidence is the dividend. For the last several years, we've discussed our goal to align our dividend growth with our adjusted EPS growth. 
Our Board of Directors recently declared a $0.06 increase in our quarterly common dividend, which is now $1.01 per share. That's a 6% increase as planned. We expect to continue this growth trend going forward, obviously, subject to Board approval. That's good news for our owners to provide the capital needed to meet our customers' evolving needs. 
Today, we are executing on key deliverables, and we have a solid base plan to meet or exceed our strategic and financial objectives. In less than a week, Leo, Rod and I will be imported to meet with many of you in person for the first time in almost 2 years. We'll provide our typical updates on considerations for next year's earnings expectations and will provide our preliminary 3-year capital plan, including a positive update on our expectation for renewables. 
We'll also talk about the significant long-term customer-centric investment beyond our current outlooks from renewables, clean electrification and acceleration of our system resilience. We're excited about these opportunities ahead and look forward to talking to you about all of it at EEI. 
And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

So that's really been where we are. 
In terms of what's been going on recently, our focus has been really on how do we get the next steps done and what's the logical progression to what we want to do, and that is to support the credit E&O. As it relates to those other items, they're still out there, and we plan to cooperate with the counsel as they go forward. In most of those instances, we're still wanting to hear from them in terms of what their objectives are as it relates to whether it's the ownership structure or what have you. 
So those are processes that they began to the extent that they have objectives, we'll work collaboratively with them to meet those needs. And we think that however it works out, it will work out fine for us and for them."

And it's been obviously an immediate question with investors is just around the storms and maybe the expenses that were incurred. Can we just maybe get an update on some of the other mitigating factors per customer bill headroom, and you obviously talked about volumetric growth and the macro backdrop. 
But there's obviously -- and also there's work you're doing with the LPSC and New Orleans to get federal support. But how are you, I guess, thinking about other charges rolling off and potentially having the bill headroom to continue kind of investing in especially as we're seeing your '24 numbers in line with the 6% midpoint growth in '24. 
So could we assume this run rate remains healthy despite some of the near-term concerns around build pressure and escalating storm issues?"
269764,1684318472,2423119,"Entergy Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Yes, Shar, this is Drew.

I'll tackle that first, and then I'll let Rod, Leo pitch in. So I'll mention a couple of things. First of all, the securitization is what we're moving forward with in Texas and Louisiana for the recent storms. But there's also a bunch of securitization is also still rolling off, and that includes costs associated with Ike and Texas. I think that comes rolls off next year. Similar in Louisiana, Gustaf and Ike are rolling off and even Isaac costs are going to start to roll off maybe in 2024. 
So those are relatively near term that can take some of the pressure off of the securitization costs also natural gas prices, there's been a lot of discussion about natural gas prices. Obviously, a lot of people are experiencing higher natural gas prices and highlights some of the investments we've made in high-efficiency CCGTs, the diversification in our fleet for nuclear, it also highlights the stronger business case for solar. 
But the forward curve for natural gas is somewhat, as you know, backwardated. And the prices get pretty low. In fact, if you just go out a couple of years, our internal forecasts are higher than what the NYMEX curve would say by the time you get out to something like 2024. So that's we don't necessarily view that as a long-term problem. Certainly, it's a challenge for our customers right now. And starting with Winterstorm ore and the price spikes then. But we've already recovered all of those costs, and we're moving forward. 
And then finally, for some of the growth capital that's out there, we highlighted the 3 areas associated with the significant potential investments, starting with resilience and accelerating our resilience program, that's really kind of in lieu of future securitization to the extent that we can put more resilience in place than what we were already planning that would offset the future securitization costs. 
So that's a different portion of the bill, so to speak, than we would normally see. And then, of course, with renewables the fuel costs, the O&M associated with that. And if you look at our capital plan, and we'll talk about this at EEI, there's been quite a bit of rotation in our capital plan in the generation space from future CCGTs to renewables. And so that's taking up bill space that we are already planning to use. 
And then finally, the clean electrification, as Leo mentioned in his remarks, that includes incremental sales, and that should provide space for that incremental investment. So we believe that all of that should there are spaces for all of this to happen and even accelerate as we go forward in the next few years."

The -- certainly, as we look for support for things like hydrogen and support for things like existing nuclear, we view all of that in addition to continued support for renewables. We view all that as positive towards our ability to keep a low-cost profile of the future benefits associated with our capital plan. 
We're really, really -- I guess I'll start by saying I'm cautiously optimistic that there will be an infrastructure bills that will be passed. It's -- every day, there's new news one way or the other in terms of how that's going, depending on who you hear from. But as you know, we are pretty well positioned in the hydrogen space. We have a significant fleet of existing nuclear plants. We're deploying a lot of new renewables. 
So all of the that focus on tax credits, particularly production tax credits, is really -- we view that as highly supportive of what we are already planning on working forward with. And we would anticipate having the capability, at least as we're interpreting things today, and I know there's a lot of devil in the details to come to be able to utilize as much of that as we can for the benefit of our customers. 
But again, as you know, we're very excited about the hydrogen space. As I mentioned in my remarks, we made the filing associated with getting the Orange County Advanced Power Station, which will be hydrogen capable, approved in Texas. With all the hydrogen infrastructure that's around us that will be very, very important for not only us but for the industry as we look to utilize long-duration storage, a critical factor in anyone's ability to get to net-zero by 2050. 
And I'd also say that's well supported by the fact that the industrial gas customers in our service territory are all exploring green, blue and pink hydrogen as well. And so I think specifically, we'll have to see exactly where everything ends up, if it gets done, but we see it as really a way for us to accelerate what we're already trying to do."

So I'll start and let Rod jump in because Rod has actually been down this path before post Katrina as it relates to CDBG funds that were acquired for New Orleans. As you know, Governor Edwards has made an appeal to the government for funds to support recovery for a variety of reasons as it relates to 2020 storms as well as Hurricane Ida. 
And in those requests of the administration, he's put in about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for utility restoration offsets for our customers. So the process has been for us to work with our congressional delegation to the LPSC, the City Council and the governor try and convince effectively the federal government to appropriate dollars to go. They would go through HUD to the state in the form of community development block grants, and then we are also positioning for HUD to provide opportunity for a waiver so that the governor can actually allocate those dollars to investor-owned utilities in addition to what munis and co-ops and housing and other things that obviously are very, very important. 
So we're working through that process right now. A lot of us have spent time with our delegations. We've spent time at the White House. We're spending time with the agency secretaries. So all of that is in place to try and work toward offsetting the costs associated with not only Hurricane Ida, but this would also go back to 2020 storms, which is also part of the Governor's request. I don't know, Rod, if you have anything."

And I guess the only thing that remains uncertain is the timing. Just like I made reference to FERC and some of the Siri things before, there is no specific timetable for the administration Congress or had to act on the governor's request. It's now in their hands. I think the most significant development from our vantage point is that we have clear alignment amongst the delegation and express support from the White House and our governor for the utility customers. That's a big deal. 
As we think back to our experiences doing in Katrina it took a while to get that alignment that the objective of offsetting on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the regulatory compact impact of storms on customer bills. There's no lack of alignment around the desire to achieve that. So that part, we've been able to close the gap on quicker than in prior storm or disaster events now comes the ultimate decision-making process of allocating those funds to the states so that the governor could industry so time line is uncertainty."

So we're aligned with our regulators in that concept, in that theory. We're certainly not in a position where we're looking to exit MISO at any point in time. We entered MISO because of the benefits.

269764,1684318472,2423553,"Entergy Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting quarterly results that keep us firmly on track to meet our financial commitments. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.45 per share. With good visibility into the rest of the year, we",1492,"Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting quarterly results that keep us firmly on track to meet our financial commitments. Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.45 per share. With good visibility into the rest of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 guidance range and $5.90 through $6.10 per share and expect to achieve 2022 and 2023 results in line with our outlooks.
Further, we are extending our outlooks to include 2024 and see our steady predictable growth of 5% to 7% continuing through this period. Additionally, we achieved the milestone of raising our dividend by 6% and aligning with our earnings growth. This happened on the schedule we previously communicated and represents another commitment met. We have developed a more resilient business. And despite $65 million of nonfuel revenue losses in the third quarter due to Hurricane Ida, we are maintaining our financial commitments.  
Our resiliency provides stability that is valuable to all of our stakeholders, particularly customers and owners. The quarter was heavily impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall as a strong category for hurricane bringing powerful destructive wins across New Orleans, Baton Rouge and beyond. Our coastal communities were particularly hard hit by both strong winds and storm surge. Ida disrupted the lives and businesses of many of our customers and communities and Entergy was there to help when they needed us.  
We gathered a restoration force of 27,000, our largest ever, representing Entergy employees, contractors and mutual assistance crews from 41 states across the country. I would like to take a moment to personally thank our employees and the crews who answered the call to come help restore power to our impacted customers. Further gratitude goes to our employees who worked restoration despite their own homes being damaged by Ida.  
They epitomize what it means to put our customers first. I never cease to be amazed by the dedication and effectiveness of the many restoration workers who step away from their lives for weeks at a time to help our customers and communities get their lives and livelihoods back up and running again. Despite Ida's wins creating significant damage and destruction across our power grid with close to 1 million peak outages, our team restored customers at a rapid pace. In just over a week, we had roughly half of all customers restored.  
Metro areas like New Orleans and Baton Rouge saw restoration essentially completed by day 10. Within 3 weeks, more than 98% of all affected customers were restored. And it's easy to lose sight of the fact that this restoration was successfully accomplished while dealing with the effects of the pandemic. Entergy also helped our customers and communities throughout the recovery process by developing -- or deploying 165 commercial scale generators to power critical community infrastructure like medical facilities, gas stations, grocery stores, municipal water systems and community cooling centers in advance of power being restored.  
In addition to restoration work, Entergy's employees contributed countless hours to their communities and Entergy shareholders committed $1.25 million to help affected communities rebuild and recover. While power has been restored to customers who can safely take it, our job is not finished. We are committed to minimizing the effects of Ida on our customers' bills. 
We will work with our regulators to seek securitization of Ida storm costs, which is a proven and low-cost means of recovery. Further, we are coordinating with key officials and stakeholders, including Louisiana Governor Edwards, The City Council of New Orleans, Louisiana Public Service Commission, Louisiana Congressional Delegation and the Biden administration to seek federal support that could offset the cost of our customers for Ida in the 2020 storms. 
There is widespread alignment among state and local leaders on the compelling case that Louisiana has to obtain federal support. We are fully aligned with this perspective. To be clear, any federal funding that Entergy utilities obtain will reduce the customer obligation dollar for dollar. We're also committed to mitigating the impacts of future storms. Entergy has made significant transmission and distribution investments, nearly $10 billion over the last 5 years, which made our system more resilient. 
We've seen those new investments perform well under the most challenging conditions. Wind damage to our transmission structures, for example, has occurred most almost exclusively to older structures built to prior standards. It has become clear that major weather events of all types are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. 
Hurricane Laura made landfall as the strongest storm to hit the Louisiana Coast since 1856. Then exactly 12 months later, Hurricane Ida hit with almost equal force. Our resilient standards and asset programs have never been static, and we've continued to evolve them. And as I mentioned, our investments are working as designed. 
However, the uptick in severity and frequency of storms is compelling us to take a fresh look at how we can make our system more resilient, including the pace at which we can achieve it. Even prior to Ida, we are actively deploying multiple options along the resiliency scale, particularly for our service areas south of I-10 and I-12, which has the greatest exposure to hurricane-strength winds and flooding. 
Evaluating these resiliency options needs to be done under future climate scenarios. And we are taking into account important considerations such as customer affordability and sufficiency of materials and skilled labor. This customer-driven investment will be significant, and we will work collaboratively with our regulators and other stakeholders to determine the optimal path forward. 
Coming back to the quarter, I would like to highlight that despite dealing with a major storm, the business continued to run well without missing a beat. We've made great progress in several open proceedings. First, Entergy Arkansas filed a unanimous settlement for its formula rate plan, and the Arkansas Commission has agreed to cancel the hearing and take up the settlement based on the filed testimony, which is positive. 
New rates in Arkansas will be implemented in January. In New Orleans, we recently implemented rates at the level that reflected all adjustments proposed by the council's advisers so there are no further proceedings there. We also are pleased to note that Entergy Arkansas reached a settlement with key customers of its Green Promise tariff filing. If approved, this tariff will enable us to offer green solutions to meet the growing sustainability demands of our customers. 
And we're making progress on other open proceedings. In Entergy Louisiana, its FRP rates went into effect. Entergy Arkansas received approval for the West Memphis Solar project. Entergy Texas reached an unopposed settlement on its 2020 storm cost filing. And Entergy Texas also filed for approval of the Orange County Advanced Power Station. And the Louisiana 2020 storm recovery and securitization process remains on track. 
We continue to make progress on decarbonizing our fleet. We've announced 5 gigawatts of solar in our supply plan through 2030 with a goal of doing more. And an update to our supply plan and renewables growth will be provided next week at EEI. In addition to healthy meeting -- in addition to helping meet decarbonization goals, the cost of renewable resources relative to conventional resources continues to trend favorably, and renewable resources provided an important edge against rising and volatile natural gas prices. 
We will provide more details around our latest resource plans at EEI. Last quarter, I discussed ways in which Entergy can help our industrial customers meet their sustainability goals. While many have expressed long-term goals like net-zero by 2050, even more have developed shorter-term interim goals that will require action by the end of the decade. 
Clean electrification is one of several important tools that our industrial customers have as a means to achieve their objectives. Clean electrification provides a great opportunity for load growth and will require significant capital investment in renewable generation, transmission and distribution. 
The load growth that comes with electrification will help pay for incremental customer-centric investments. We'll have more to discuss regarding the opportunity we have to help our customers meet their sustainability objectives next week at EEI. While it is important to discuss these longer-term growth opportunities, I want to make sure we don't lose sight of the very solid based investment plan that we have in front of us. 
Over the next 3 years, we have a $12 billion capital plan that is designed to deliver reliability, resilience and improve customer experience and environmental and cost efficiency benefits to our customers. When paired with our well-defined regulatory constructs, our plan will deliver 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth for our owners over the next 3 years. That's a very solid base plan. 
And beyond this strong foundation, these other opportunities in renewable generation, clean electrification and resilience acceleration will serve to extend our runway of growth throughout the rest of the decade. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you at the EEI Financial Conference. 
Now Drew will review the quarterly results."

Summarized on Slide 5, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, slightly higher than a year ago. We continue to execute our strategy, and we are firmly on track to meet our commitments. In fact, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are narrowing our guidance range to $5.90 to $6.10. We're also affirming our outlooks and extending the outlook period through 2024, and we recently raised our dividend to align with our adjusted EPS growth rate. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our investments to improve customer outcomes continue to drive growth. That includes rate changes to recover those investments as well as associated new operating expenses. Industrial billed sales were 10% stronger than a year ago. We saw increases across most segments with the largest increases in primary metals, petrochemicals, transportation, industrial gases and chlor-alkali. 
This reaffirms the strength of our industrial customer base. And in a world with supply chain constraints and higher energy prices, our industrial customers' businesses remain strong and competitive. These industrial sales were strong despite Hurricane Ida. 
Overall, across all classes, we estimate that third quarter revenues were approximately $65 million lower as a result of Ida. Hurricane Laura's impact on third quarter 2020 was approximately half of that. Other O&M was higher this quarter as planned. This is partly due to higher costs for distribution operations, including reliability costs, higher expenses in our power generation function and higher health and benefit costs. 
Moving to EWC on Slide 7. You'll see results were slightly lower than a year ago. The key driver was the shutdown and sale of Indian Point. Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 8. The quarter's result is about $300 million higher than last year. The increase is due largely to improved collections from customers, including collections associated with investments to benefit customers and Winter Storm Uri. This was partially offset by expenditures related to higher natural gas prices. 
Slide 9 summarizes our credit and liquidity. We expect to maintain our current credit ratings, and we continue to expect to achieve targeted rating agency credit metrics as storm restoration spending is securitized and we retire storm-related debt. I'll take a minute to discuss our balance sheet, beginning with a quick update on Hurricane Ida on Slide 10. 
Over the past several weeks, we've refined our cost estimates, and we've shaved $100 million off the upper end of the range. The total cost is now expected to be $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. We've also updated our estimate of the nonfuel revenue loss to $75 million to $80 million, the lower half of our previous range. While our net liquidity, including storm reserves remained strong at $4 billion, we are also working to ensure timely storm cost recovery. That starts with a successful restoration effort and proceeds through 2 avenues. 
First, Entergy Louisiana amended its 2020 storm filing to request an additional $1 billion to provide early liquidity for Hurricane Ida costs. And in Texas, we reached a settlement on the 2020 storm cost filing and that is now before the PUCT. Second, we have improved the efficiency of our storm invoice processing to accelerate our filings and ultimately, cost recovery. 
We plan to complete financing for the 2020 storms by early next year and Ida by the end of next year. And our work isn't over, we'll continue to identify ways to further reduce business risk. As Leo highlighted, we are looking forward to a conversation with our customers, retail regulators and other stakeholders about how we best accelerate and implement a strong resilience plan. 
We have already hardened more than half of our critical transmission and distribution structures along the Gulf Coast to standards implemented after Katrina and Rita, continue to move the bar higher by reevaluating current standards using the latest weather data. In addition, a comprehensive resilience plan needs to include the strategic placement of assets to allow higher-risk communities to recover more quickly. 
For example, MicroGrid's Distributed Energy Resources and the deployment of generators, Leo highlighted to certain critical customers and the aftermath of storms could be very helpful in supporting communities as they recover. I go into more depth on this in our conversations with EEI. 
In addition to physical resilience, our regulators know the importance of a healthy credit at the operating companies to support customers. And they have put in place time-tested cost recovery mechanisms such as securitization and storm reserves to support that need. We are fortunate that in looking to recover the 2020 and 2021 storm costs, we are starting with some of the lowest rates in the country. 
We have significant electrification growth potential that could help pay for incremental customer-centric investments and future storm costs. All of these will support our credit as our regulators and key stakeholders aligned with us around a strong, resilient acceleration plan. 
In addition, we continue to execute on the exit of EWC, and we're less than a year from completing our plan. The resulting improvements were recognized by S&P last fall through our improved business risk profile and by Moody's, just this past quarter through changes to our rating thresholds. Those changes remain in place and our ratings reflect future storm risk. As a result, we were able to reduce our 2021 to 2024 equity need. Combined with our ATM transactions, our future equity need is more than 50% lower than the $2.5 billion communicated at Analyst Day last year. 
Moving to Slide 11. We have a clear line of sight on the remainder of the year. And for the third year in a row, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance. In this case, for 2021 to $5.90 to $6.10. We are also affirming our longer-term outlooks of 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth and extending the 2024. Our confidence in our solid base plan continues to grow, and a key expression of that confidence is the dividend. For the last several years, we've discussed our goal to align our dividend growth with our adjusted EPS growth. 
Our Board of Directors recently declared a $0.06 increase in our quarterly common dividend, which is now $1.01 per share. That's a 6% increase as planned. We expect to continue this growth trend going forward, obviously, subject to Board approval. That's good news for our owners to provide the capital needed to meet our customers' evolving needs. 
Today, we are executing on key deliverables, and we have a solid base plan to meet or exceed our strategic and financial objectives. In less than a week, Leo, Rod and I will be imported to meet with many of you in person for the first time in almost 2 years. We'll provide our typical updates on considerations for next year's earnings expectations and will provide our preliminary 3-year capital plan, including a positive update on our expectation for renewables.

I'd say, first of all, obviously, what we've been doing recently with the council is we've got through the formula rate plan and got those rates in effect, both council, us as well as the LPSC and others, as I had mentioned, we're all aligned on approaching the federal government or offsets to customer costs through potentially CDBG funds and then even in the future in terms of storm hardening as it relates to infrastructure. So that's really been where we are. 
In terms of what's been going on recently, our focus has been really on how do we get the next steps done and what's the logical progression to what we want to do, and that is to support the credit of E&O. As it relates to those other items, they're still out there, and we plan to cooperate with the counsel as they go forward. In most of those instances, we're still wanting to hear from them in terms of what their objectives are as it relates to whether it's the ownership structure or what have you. 
So those are processes that they began to the extent that they have objectives, we'll work collaboratively with them to meet those needs. And we think that however it works out, it will work out fine for us and for them."

And it's been obviously an immediate question with investors is just around the storms and maybe the expenses that were incurred. Can we just maybe get an update on some of the other mitigating factors per customer bill headroom, and you obviously talked about volumetric growth and the macro backdrop. 
But there's obviously -- and also there's work you're doing with the LPSC and New Orleans to get federal support. But how are you, I guess, thinking about other charges rolling off and potentially having the bill headroom to continue kind of investing in CapEx, especially as we're seeing your '24 numbers in line with the 6% midpoint growth in '24. 
So could we assume this run rate remains healthy despite some of the near-term concerns around bill pressure and escalating storm issues?"

I'll tackle that first, and then I'll let Rod, Leo pitch in. So I'll mention a couple of things. First of all, the securitization is what we're moving forward with in Texas and Louisiana for the recent storms. But there's also a bunch of securitizations is also still rolling off, and that includes costs associated with Ike and Texas. I think that comes rolls off next year. Similar in Louisiana, Gustav and Ike are rolling off and even Isaac costs are going to start to roll off maybe in 2024. 
So those are relatively near term that can take some of the pressure off of the securitization costs. Also natural gas prices, there's been a lot of discussion about natural gas prices. Obviously, a lot of people are experiencing higher natural gas prices and highlights some of the investments we've made in high-efficiency CCGTs, the diversification in our fleet for nuclear, it also highlights the stronger business case for solar. 
But the forward curve for natural gas is somewhat, as you know, backwardated. And the prices get pretty low. In fact, if you just go out a couple of years, our internal forecasts are higher than what the NYMEX curve would say by the time you get out to something like 2024. So that's -- we don't necessarily view that as a long-term problem. Certainly, it's a challenge for our customers right now. And starting with Winter Storm Uri  and the price spikes then. But we've already recovered all of those costs, and we're moving forward. 
And then finally, for some of the growth capital that's out there, we highlighted the 3 areas associated with the significant potential investments, starting with resilience and accelerating our resilience program, that's really kind of in lieu of future securitization to the extent that we can put more resilience in place than what we were already planning that would offset the future securitization costs. 
So that's a different portion of the bill, so to speak, than we would normally see. And then, of course, with renewables, the fuel costs, the O&M associated with that. And if you look at our capital plan, and we'll talk about this at EEI, there's been quite a bit of rotation in our capital plan in the generation space from future CCGTs to renewables. And so that's taking up bill space that we are already planning to use. 
And then finally, the clean electrification, as Leo mentioned in his remarks, that includes incremental sales, and that should provide space for that incremental investment. So we believe that all of that should -- there are spaces for all of this to happen and even accelerate as we go forward in the next few years."

And there's a lot in there. The -- certainly, as we look for support for things like hydrogen and support for things like existing nuclear, we view all of that in addition to continued support for renewables, we view all that as positive towards our ability to keep a low-cost profile of the future benefits associated with our capital plan. 
We're really, really -- I guess I'll start by saying I'm cautiously optimistic that there will be an infrastructure bills that will be passed. It's -- every day, there's new news one way or the other in terms of how that's going, depending on who you hear from. But as you know, we are pretty well positioned in the hydrogen space. We have a significant fleet of existing nuclear plants. We're deploying a lot of new renewables. 
So all of the -- that focus on tax credits, particularly production tax credits, is really -- we view that as highly supportive of what we are already planning on working forward with. And we would anticipate having the capability, at least as we're interpreting things today, and I know there's a lot of devil in the details to come to be able to utilize as much of that as we can for the benefit of our customers. 
But again, as you know, we're very excited about the hydrogen space. As I mentioned in my remarks, we made the filing associated with getting the Orange County Advanced Power Station, which will be hydrogen capable, approved in Texas. With all the hydrogen infrastructure that's around us that will be very, very important for not only us but for the industry as we look to utilize long-duration storage, a critical factor in anyone's ability to get to net-zero by 2050. 
And I'd also say that's well supported by the fact that the industrial gas customers in our service territory are all exploring green, blue and pink hydrogen as well. And so I think specifically, we'll have to see exactly where everything ends up, if it gets done, but we see it as really a way for us to accelerate what we're already trying to do."

So I'll start and let Rod jump in because Rod has actually been down this path before post Katrina as it relates to CDBG funds that were acquired for New Orleans. As you know, Governor Edwards has made an appeal to the government for funds to support recovery for a variety of reasons as it relates to 2020 storms as well as Hurricane Ida. 
And in those requests of the administration, he's put in about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for utility restoration offsets for our customers. So the process has been for us to work with our congressional delegation to the LPSC, the City Council and the governor try and convince effectively the federal government to appropriate dollars to go. They would go through HUD to the state in the form of community development block grants, and then we are also positioning for HUD to provide opportunity for a waiver so that the governor can actually allocate those dollars to investor-owned utilities in addition to what munis and co-ops and housing and other things that obviously are very, very important. 
So we're working through that process right now. A lot of us have spent time with our delegations. We've spent time at the White House. We're spending time with the agency secretaries. So all of that is in place to try and work toward offsetting the costs associated with not only Hurricane Ida, but this would also go back to 2020 storms, which is also part of the Governor's request.

We've saved about $1.75 billion, nominally over the period of time since 2014 when we joined into 2013. So certainly, there's been a benefit to MISO, where we see our regulators taking issue and where actually we're supportive of them is just making sure that we get the allocation of costs of major transmission projects done correctly. And making sure that as we would like to see that the people get the benefit to major transmission upgrades are the ones who actually bear the cost of major transmission upgrades as opposed to people who don't get any benefit bearing that cost. 
So we're aligned with our regulators in that concept, in that theory. We're certainly not in a position where we're looking to exit MISO at any point in time. We entered MISO because of the benefits. We've obviously seen those benefits. But as the world evolves and as the capital plans evolve and the transition to renewables evolve and differently north versus south, we just need to make sure that we continue to evolve the process cost allocation in a thoughtful way.

I'm happy to report another solid quarter. Our adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather.

Our adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, including a negative impact from milder-than-normal weather. The underlying utility performance was strong, and our team successfully executed on multiple deliverables across the business. 
Our execution not only this year but over the last several years has resulted in strong growth and lower risk. This, in turn, has provided us more financial flexibility, which was most recently recognized by Moody's. 
The result is enhanced ability to manage risk and lower equity needs to fund our growth. The bottom line is, we are on track to deliver on our commitments, including our financial results. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2021 guidance as well as our longer-term financial outlooks and with added financial flexibility from our lower business risk profile, we expect to be in the top half of those ranges. 
Our 3-year $12 billion capital plan is the foundation. It is designed to deliver important benefits to our customers and will result in 5% to 7% adjusted EPS and dividend growth. Our capital investments will improve customer outcomes along several dimensions including reliability, resiliency, affordability and sustainability. Our plan also supports our expectation of at least 5,000 megawatts of renewables by 2030 delivering on our environmental stewardship commitments. 
There is a great deal of certainty around the execution of our plan as more than 90% of our investments today are tied to enhancing technology across our system to improve reliability and resiliency. 90% of our investments will be recovered through efficient and timely regulatory mechanisms such as FRPs and riders and 90% of these investments are ready for execution from a regulatory standpoint. 
Additionally, we were able to manage our costs to provide certainty to our stakeholders through both our flex spending program and continuous improvement. These initiatives allow us to manage our customers' bills and keep them affordable while also providing steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our owners. 
We have consistently maintained rates among the lowest in the country, and we have achieved 7% compound annual growth in adjusted EPS for 2016 to 2020. Our accomplishments so far this year keep us firmly on the path to meet our objectives. One important objective is increasing our renewable and clean energy resources. To that end, Entergy Texas began the process to seek approval to construct the Orange County Advanced Power Station, a large-scale hydrogen capable facility that represents a significant milestone in our strategy to provide clean energy that also supports reliability. 
We received approval from the Arkansas Commission for the Walnut Bend Solar project. We will own this 100-megawatt facility, which is expected to be placed in service in 2022. It will provide clean energy for our customers in Arkansas and possibly provide capacity under a green tariff. We recently filed our proposed green promise tariff in Arkansas to allow for the sale of designated renewable energy to interested customers. 
Many customers have expressed interest in such an offer. And in fact, customers had input into the development of the proposal. We have received signed nonbinding letters of interest from 20 customers, including Walmart, a global technology company, a major retail pharmacy company, nearly a dozen hospitals or hospital networks and Arkansas University and a number of large manufacturing customers. 
Our customers are telling us what they want, and we're listening. We're working to bring them offerings such as green promise to help them achieve their sustainability goals. We also continue to make progress on our annual FRPs, which provide for timely recovery of investments that benefit customers.  Entergy Mississippi's FRP was approved and the full rates are in effect. And we submitted our annual filings in 3 jurisdictions: Arkansas, Louisiana and New Orleans. Many of you are interested in our strong recovery filing, they remain on track. Legislation to support off-balance sheet securitization past in Louisiana and Texas, and we expect to receive proceeds by mid 2022.  In fact, Entergy Louisiana filed its request for securitization this past Friday. 
As I've mentioned before, building greater resiliency into our system is an ongoing focus. Some of our resiliency improvements have been occurring as normal course of business as we replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure with assets designed, the latest standards and able to handle higher wind loading or flood levels. 
At times, these resiliency improvements are accelerated likely we build back better after a major storm. However, we won't wait for another storm to continue to strengthen our system. We're conducting a review of our critical infrastructure, and we are developing long-term plans to continue this progress on the path to greater resiliency. 
Customer affordability continues to be a cornerstone of our plan. We're starting at a great place and looking ahead, even after accounting for storm recovery, we will still expect our rates to be well below the national average. And the annual growth rate for average bills from 2021 to 2024 is slightly above 2%. 
Bottom line,  so we have a solid plan with significant certainty and a strong growth outlook. We consistently execute on our key deliverables that underlie our commitments. We have a proven track record of delivering on those commitments. 
We're confident that we will be successful, but we're not stopping there. We aspire to do even better. Over the last several years, we've been highlighting the opportunity we see in customer solutions. We've begun to commercialize some of those solutions such as power through, our backup generator solution and shore power, the electrification of ships while imports. 
We're also developing other products to further electrification of industrial processes to accelerate the development of EV infrastructure. We're expanding our product and service offerings to help our C&I customers meet their sustainability objectives. 
We are actively working to reduce our carbon emissions, and that will help all of our customers reduce their Scope 2 emissions. To further support our customers' aggressive decarbonization goals, we will leverage green tariffs to provide carbon-free resources to further reduce their Scope 2 emissions. 
As you all know, Entergy has a large industrial base with about 40% of our demand coming from industrial customers. Some have viewed this as a risk, but we disagree. We see continued opportunity in this sector and here's why. Our industrial customers are efficient, diverse producers with infrastructure and labor competitive advantages. Our Gulf Coast refineries produce a wide variety of feedstocks and finished products highly integrated into the value chain. 
This is not going away. Even as products like cars evolve toward more sustainable options, the components of these products will still be needed. For example, cars and trucks will still have tires, frames and dashboards, all things created from feedstocks produced by Entergy's industrial customers. 
Additionally, in a carbon-constrained world, we see opportunity for additional growth in demand from our industrial customers. We talked about green tariffs as 1 way to help them meet sustainability goals, but that only addresses Scope 2 emissions that come from their power purchases.  The lion's share of our industrial carbon emissions come from Scope 1 emissions from fossil fuels that they use on site. 
Again, we're developing ways to help customers reduce their Scope 1 emissions through electrification, including electrification with green options. Substantial opportunity exists for us to help them electrify processes such as compression for LNG or product pipelines. Cogeneration, replacing a fossil fuel process with an electric alternative and processed to convert on-site boilers to electric heating. 
And as our customers adopt carbon capture utilization and storage, we can provide green energy to maximize the benefit of that technology. As we've discussed, Entergy's geographic positioning in the heart of hydrogen producers, pipeline, storage and consumers represents another unique opportunity. We have the ability to help our hydrogen customers, both producers and consumers convert to carbon-friendly hydrogen alternatives. The bottom line is that we believe our large industrial base gives Entergy a unique advantage and growth opportunity in a rapidly decarbonizing world. 
Turning our efforts -- to our efforts around hydrogen which we see as a clinical part of a clean energy future. We are working with Mitsubishi Power to advance technologies and expertise in hydrogen for the benefit of our customers. Part of our collaboration involves the hydrogen capable Orange County Advanced Power Station, which I mentioned earlier. 
We're also continuing our work on Montgomery County Innovation Center, a 25-megawatt electrolysis facility to demonstrate green and clean hydrogen production capabilities. 
Finally, we recently participated in the DOE's Hydrogen Energy Earthshots initiative. Our goal is to secure federal funding to help jump-start hydrogen demonstration projects in our region in a matter that mitigates impacts on our customers' bills.  We expect to see a request for proposal notice from the DOE later this year or early next year. 
At Entergy, we have a solid strategy to achieve our objectives. We are an industry leader in sustainability. We have one of the cleanest large-scale generation fleets in the countries and we're working to make it even cleaner. 
We have a robust capital plan to meet our customers' evolving needs. Our low rates position us well. We're committed to continuous improvement for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have a clear line of sight to 5% to 7% earnings and dividend growth, and we have a unique advantage with our customer base to provide sustainability solutions that could result in sales growth. 
Even with our excellent positioning today, our goal is to do more. These are exciting times, and we're working to create a very bright future for our company. I will now turn the call over to Drew, who will review our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook."

We continue to execute on our key deliverables. We'",1259,"Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting results for another solid quarter. As you can see on Slide 5, we have experienced robust sales as we recovered from the impact of COVID-19. We continue to execute on our key deliverables. We're well on our way to achieving our goals for the year, and we are affirming our strong guidance and longer-term outlooks while pointing to the upper end of the range for each. 
Turning to Slide 6. You'll see the primary drivers for earnings in the quarter were straightforward. We continue to see the effects of our investments to improve customer outcomes, including rate changes to recover those investments. We also saw effects of the COVID-19 recovery. Sales were higher than last year despite negative weather in the quarter. 
Our industrial sales improved 7.1% year-over-year, driven by economic recovery and growth. Our industrial customers are now running at levels exceeding 2019. Commercial sales also are continuing to recover as businesses reopen and residential sales are beginning to taper as workers go back to their offices. 
On Slide 7, you'll see a little more detail on key sector indicators for our industrial customers. These 4 sectors collectively represent nearly half of our industrial sales. As you can see, the economic indicators are healthy and at or near multiyear high points. Inventories are back in alignment, commodity spreads have improved and volumes and margins are doing better across the board. 
Overall, our industrial base has rebounded nicely from the challenges of 2020. We are fortunate to have a resilient and competitively advantaged industrial base. Turning back to the earnings drivers. Our spending increased as we return to more normal business conditions. This increase is expected as we significantly reduced costs last year to offset the effects of COVID-19. 
The spending includes increased scope of work at our generating plants, including outages deferred from the past year. We also have incremental spending for new plants in service and in our focus areas of reliability and improving the customer experience. 
Our O&M expectation for the full year remains $2.7 billion, and we will continue to utilize our flexible spending tools to achieve steady predictable results. 
Moving to EWC on Slide 8, you'll see the results were lower than the prior year. The key driver was the sale of Indian Point to Holtec. The sale resulted in a pretax charge of $340 million, driven primarily by the nuclear decommissioning trust exceeding the decommissioning liability. 
The sale of Indian Point is a significant accomplishment and an important milestone in our exit of EWC and 1 which further improves our business risk profile, the impact of which I will address shortly. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter is shown on Slide 9. The quarter's result is slightly higher than last year's operating cash flow returns to more normal levels. This change is due primarily to improved collections from customers, which are offset by a few items. 
Fuel prices increased compared to last year, and we saw a negative cash flow impact from the timing of fuel and purchase power cost recovery. Severance and retention payments were higher at EWC relating to the closure and sale of Indian Point. And we also had some remaining payments for noncapital 2020 storm costs. 
Our current credit metrics are shown on Slide 10. Our parent debt to total debt is 22.4% and our FFO to debt is 8.3%. Our FFO to debt remained suppressed in large part due to the financial impacts from storms. As we mentioned in the past few quarters, we expect the metric to return to targeted levels in 2022 after we receive securitization proceeds and pay down the incremental debt. 
We've made our storm recovery filings in Louisiana, Texas and New Orleans. As Leo noted, both Louisiana and Texas passed legislation to support off-balance sheet treatment for securitization. And last week, Entergy Louisiana made a securitization filing. Recovering storm costs through securitized debt is the best alternative for customers and help strengthen our balance sheet. 
As we communicated, we have several options to meet our equity needs. In this past quarter, we utilized the at-the-market equity program. As of the end of June, we had sold approximately $73 million of common stock, of which approximately 2/3 were forward sales, which could settle as late as next fall. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the Moody's advisory that was issued this past week. Though affirming SIRI's investment-grade ratings, Moody's did play a theory on negative outlook signing the currently pending cases filed against SIRI at FERC by Retail Utility Commissions. Moody's indicated that these cases have the potential to erode SIRI's earnings power and cost recovery. While we are, of course, disappointed by this change, we recognize that the level of claims brought against SIRI approached the value of Grand Gulf. And the regulatory environment in which SIRI is operating is far from constructive. 
In the same advisory, Moody's affirmed the parent investment-grade rating and outlook recognizing that Entergy's larger size and diversity could withstand adverse outcomes at SIRI. In addition, Moody's recognized our improved business risk profile, which is a result of our successful multiyear strategy to wind down the EWC merchant business and grow our utility business. 
To do this, they reduced the cash flow from operations minus working capital to debt threshold. That's a bit of a mouthful for Entergy Corporation from 15% to 14%. We are pleased with the recognition of the derisking that we've accomplished in our business and combined with S&P's simpler recognition last fall. We are excited about the enhanced financial flexibility that our work is unlocked. 
Moving to Slide 11. The recent recognition of our derisking efforts and incremental balance sheet capacity, we are early in the process of determining its full impact on our plans and outlooks. That said, there are some early takeaways. First, the incremental capacity significantly increases our confidence in our ability to execute the current business plan. 
Second, we will not need as much equity to fund our utility growth. While we are affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.80 to $6.10 as well as our longer-term outlook for 5% to 7% adjusted earnings per share growth. The combination of the improved confidence and lower equity needs places us in the top half of our guidance and outlook ranges. 
We have a clear line of sight on our capital plans to benefit customers and a robust balance sheet to support that investment, both underpinned by a strong continuous improvement program and disciplined flexible spending plans. We plan to invest for the benefit of our customers and projects designed to improve reliability, sustainability, resiliency and customer experience. 
These investments and programs further support community economic development and employee development, all while keeping our focus on low rates. Finally, the incremental balance sheet capacity resulting from our derisking efforts will enhance our ability to unlock the significant investment opportunities that will flow from working alongside our commercial and industrial customers that Leo described to help them lower their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
Today, we are executing on our key deliverables, and we are firmly on track to meet or exceed our financial objectives. We are investing in customer solutions to enhance our customers' experience and our investments in renewables and hydrogen technology will continue to support our sustainability efforts and those of our customers to provide new opportunities in the future. 
We are very excited about the growth opportunities ahead. And now the Entergy team is available to answer questions."

We have been working on this a long time, but we just got the recognition from Moody's in the past week or so, as I mentioned. And so we are still early in the assessment of what the overall impact means I pointed to a couple of the early elements associated with it. 
We expect to complete that this fall. It could be sooner. I would say probably no later than EEI, but it could be sooner than that. And as it relates to something like the share count or specifics around size, I don't have those kinds of details available to give you today. Other than to say, we believe it would be meaningful. It will be a meaningful change. In terms of the evaluation, which is I think part of the question that you had in there, we still want to make sure that we are hitting our earnings and credit expectations. We will still need to issue a little bit of equity to do that. But the opportunity is much more robust in front of us now. We think it's been significantly derisked. We have a lot more confidence, as I said, in our ability to execute. And -- but we don't have specifics that we can give you today. 
A couple of other sizing or, I should say, valuation perspectives. One is that, as Leo talked about extensively, we have a significant growth opportunity ahead of us, and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to invest into that opportunity as it materializes. And then Moody's specifically also talked about SIRI and our ability to manage that risk as it's presented right now, specifically around the uncertain tax position case. 
And their perspective was that we should be able to manage that risk and still meet the expectations around earnings and credit. And so we want to make sure that we have that capacity built in as well. And of course, we still believe that we're going to be successful in SIRI. I know that wasn't really your question, but if that doesn't materialize, that would be incremental opportunity for us to invest in the business."

In terms of the big puts and takes, I mean, I think the first thing is just sort of the back of the envelope math in terms of what the -- how much put and take is out there.

In terms of the big puts and takes, I mean, I think the first thing is just sort of the back of the envelope math in terms of what the -- how much put and take is out there. And when you go from 15% to 14%, given the size of our cash flow, it's somewhere in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range, and it's sort of growing over time. So it's a lot of extra capacity. The -- and what we are considering in terms of the building blocks, I think, as I mentioned, I think there's probably 3 big ones, right? One is, okay, so how much incremental equity we really need right now. That will take up some of that capacity. 
One is how much opportunity is really out there for growth in the commercial and industrial space as we ramp up our ability to work alongside our customers to manage their Scope 1 and Scope 2 positions. Those are probably the 2 big ones. 
Then Moody's specifically talked about our ability to manage identifiable risks that are out there. And they pointed to SIRI specifically. And if you take the ALJ's recommendation around uncertain tax position. That's in the ballpark of a little over $500 million. That could be a piece of capacity as well. Certainly, we're very comfortable in the way that we are positioned in that case, and we can go through that, and we have in the past, as you know. So I mean I think it's -- that is additional something that we're thinking about as well, make sure that we have the capacity to manage a risk like that, and that Moody's was pointing at that. So I mean, those are the 3 things. 
We certainly had a forecast before this ruling last week that said we were going to hit our earnings expectations. We were going to hit our targets on credit, though there still the case. Now we have extra capacity to do that and manage through these new opportunities and these risks. So it's incrementally better for us because it really derisks our ability to execute."

There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing",553,"So Steve, that's a good question. There's a couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now. One, as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental benefits necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing resiliency across the system, which could lead to more T&D investment going forward. 
So that's an area that I did want to point out, the assessment of that in conjunction with what's going on with infrastructure in Washington could be a combination of rate base assets -- some costs that are actually picked up by the states and the federal government through potentially the infrastructure build, depending on how that all works out. 
The big opportunity to -- and we've been talking about this for a while, obviously, is the size of the emissions footprint of our industrial base. And if you just go on the Internet, look at who our industrial customers are and look at their websites, they all have sustainability objectives that many of which are public. And so there's a couple of ways for us to help them out. One, what we already do when they buy electricity from us, it's some of the cleanest electricity in the country. So their Scope 2 emissions are lower. To drive those even lower, we've been discussing things like green tariffs with those customers. And that really makes the deployment of our renewables more efficient. 
And so for example, we got the solar facility that we got approval for in Arkansas filing a green tariff in Arkansas. We already have customers like Walmart who are in to talk to us about taking a slice of those facilities to make the deployment of those more efficient in a way that could accelerate our investment in renewables, if there's a large uptake of that, particularly if that spreads over into our industrial customers, which we're already having discussions with them on that. 
Then the big opportunity is exactly what you said, is to attack their Scope 1 emissions and that really is again, outside of just merely adding generation to the system for technological improvement, now we would be adding toward load growth. And so you can think about it as it's new load with new sales for new processes that today are not electrified, that would provide us the opportunity to deploy assets to help them meet those objectives. And primarily, that could not only accelerate, but increase the size of our renewable footprint going forward. 
We're in the early stage of the size and timing of that. So we'll be laying out more as we go, but it would be rate base additions to meet regulated utility sales for things like they're using natural gas compression on a pipeline today, electrifying that and we're using fossil fuels to further pricing in LNG process that can be electrified. If they're cogenerating with highly inefficient and high emitting generation on site today, that could be electrified by us or utilizing green tariffs or to the extent that we develop hydrogen over time, but that can be a part of the mix as well. So it's a pretty significant opportunity that we're in the early stages of investigating. We're having a lot of discussions with our customers about what their needs are."

And we certainly need to continue to help our customers be competitive as they go forward. It's going to depend on the process. For example, Shore Power is the exact same opportunity where you've got a ship pulls into dock, it's burning diesel fuel to keep the lights on while they do maintenance on the ship before they go back out into the Gulf of Mexico, for example, to help with the oil services out there. When we electrify that ship, we not only reduce our emissions, which was the original discussion around it, but it does lower their cost because the trade from our electricity to diesel fuel is a positive one. So it does 2 things for them. It lowers their cost and it improves their emissions, both of which make them more competitive as they bid for offshore work. So it's going to be a combination of all of those things."
