Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment. 
We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. 
We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, 2 fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond. 
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile times as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift of consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our Packaged Goods company customers and Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other food service customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption and eat as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. 
Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. And our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation. 
This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter end fiscal year results as well as the details of our 2021 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 6. Starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line, versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. 
Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with a partial offset from lower interest expense. 
Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance. Starting on Slide 7, in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6% on constant currency, 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. 
Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data. 
As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. To protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. And consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores as well as some impact from lower promotional activity. 
Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio in spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. While fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints, this had double-digit growth for the year as the spices and seasonings and the other key categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints including hot sauces, stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. The majority of our categories continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, [ Laurie ], Simply Asia and Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. 
While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the 5 weeks ending January 17, total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again. 
In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on holiday proving to be successful. And our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. 
And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and will continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation. 
Now turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories. Spices and seasoning consumption was strong in all markets, and our [indiscernible] again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. 
In the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. 
Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our consumer segment in this region. The foodservice industry is continuing to recover but at a gradual pace. Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's Redhot in Australia. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3% and all 3 regions contributed to the sales growth. In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our Consumer Packaged goods customers or at home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products. 
Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded food service was [ up ] 2%. 
In the Asia Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers, where we continue to see momentum and limited time offers and the core business, partially driven by the customers' promotional activities. 
Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we have achieved during 2020, but feel we're confident to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. And now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment, led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in Labor Solutions segment, COVID-19 restrictions in most markets as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers. 
We achieved $113 million of annual cost saves driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth, and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings. 
2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% [ increase ] from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements. 
At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. 
Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift to increase online shopping to continue and we are well positioned for the opportunity to sell ahead. 
We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing up 7% in fiscal 2020. Most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which we'll continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. 
We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again recognized as we were ranked as the #1 food brand with the highest designation of Genius by Gartner L2 Research in their digital IQ U.S. rankings. This is the seventh year in a row we were ranked in the top 5 food and beverage brands. 
We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a diversity Inc. top 50 company. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 most sustainable corporations index as #1 in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year as well as the #1 U.S. company overall and globally #6 overall. 
Finally, during the year, we continued to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new state of the art Northeast distribution center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum. 
Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plans. Starting on Slide 11. In addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms to the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high-growth category is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors, increases the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration, more value-added and technically insulated products. 
We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA which closed at the end of November and December, respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. We have approved and playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. 
In our Consumer segment we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extend its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, with our broad presence across all foodservice channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution in its existing foodservice channels as well as increased new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers, combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends, expands to the recipe inspiration and Flavor Solutions that we offer operators. 
Turning to FONA which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration, will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. 
With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. We're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods, including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus and fruit flavors. 
Combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better-for-you and consumer-preferred Flavor Solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. 
Our complementary customer bases of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. Bonus customer-centric culture is very similar to ours, and with the combined power of our organization, we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establishing inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition. 
We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. This confidence is bolstered by a proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy, and both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions. 
Now I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. We're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments. 
Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. 
Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China, is in our consumer segment. As well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown. 
And in Australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at home consumption, and we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same in the Americas. 
Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal locations is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. And while there have been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. 
We believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. Our categories across the globe experienced a sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift in consumer preference, which, coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where in the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. 
In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. Currently, service levels are improving and restoration plants have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top-selling product. We've now resumed shipping approximately 2/3 of the products, which had been suspended, with the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period, and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both our customers and McCormick, and I'd like to thank our customers for their partnership and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021 and we've implemented efficient long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth. 
Also in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings to consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021. And with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth. 
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, bringing real-time insights and actions by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration. 
For instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and product to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained for 2020. 
New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last 3 years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trials. 
Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelf. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various stages of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum with packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic products as well as new products and bigger bed innovation in 2021. 
Our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other food service customers are still impacted by government-imposed covenanting restrictions in most markets. In some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants, have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant at the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models toward delivery and carry out. The recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences. 
Overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020. Recovery has begun, and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less the dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in Flavor Solutions. And plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plants and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships. 
Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021, with top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy. 
In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. All of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery, but importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020 are effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. 
The following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization. 
Our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, chronic employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees administrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment. 
Now Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance."
181176,700101529,2183722,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook. Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in co",2136,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook. 
Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year. Pricing could partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments. 
The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals, continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting higher volume and mix in these regions. 
On Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's Red Hot, French's, Maury, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes as well as private products due to capacity constraints. 
In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago, with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, our Gojane homemade dessert products and our Camis branded products in Poland. 
Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded food service sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year, as Lawrence mentioned. 
Turning to our flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases, offset partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasoning. 
In EA, constant currency sales increased 5%, attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies with strength in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded food service and other restaurant customers. 
In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia. Partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency. 
Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. 
Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in marketing from the fourth quarter of last year, unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth and in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded food service sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. 
As seen on Slide 28. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year ago period as we have planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago, as well as higher distribution and transportation costs. 
For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-Led cost savings and favorable product mix, resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. 
The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% in constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by a 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs. 
In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense, with a partial offset for CCI-led cost savings. 
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. And our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. 
Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the full year was comparable to 2019. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. 
For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income, combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year. 
On Slide 32, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. We returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9x. And and we expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan. 
Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. Including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we had in progress as well as support our investment to fuel future growth. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending at 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate. 
In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go-lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook with a broad and advantaged flavor portfolio of robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. The we anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs and, of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations. 
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. 
Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. This resulted in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96, compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. 
Based on the expected timing of some expense items such as COVID-19 cost and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. 
I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

We have a strong foundation. We're confident in the sustainability of at home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We're excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our flavors growth platform. We are confident these investments further position us for continued success. 
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth in performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times.

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter in through the third and fourth quarter, as we talked about on previous calls and anybody that walks into the store can see that the shelves are pretty poor conditioned. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasoning. The recipe mixes that reflect the fact that we've had our secondary SKUs on suspension to protect the key holiday items. And it's really been those 2 categories that had the greatest impact. Our other product categories has had a pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. We have -- starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on. As we said in our prepared remarks, about 2/3 of them have been reinstated and the remainder coming in the coming weeks. So I think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. We still are allocating product. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, don't forget about consumer pantries being a bit fair during this time as well. So we do expect there to be benefit to this fiscal year. And we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of consumer inventory. 
I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. It's just the scale of our Consumer business in the Americas is so great, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year, even in normal circumstances, we have to prebuild inventory to supply a huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. And coming into fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have service issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. I will say, just commenting on current conditions, and I don't want to get too much into 2021. We were almost 2/3 of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers, while we're still allocating product, it's the best service that we've had since the spring."

But on pricing, there are 2 things that are happening in Nielsen that I think it look like there's more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there's been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis, where, I'd say, regular -- I'd say regular grocery has been stronger. Than other channels and tend to carry a higher price point as a result. And that comes through as pricing inflection in the Nielsen data. That is really kind of artificial. And that was 1 of the things that was pointing to. And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity. That is happening. And not just for us but across the board that comes through as different was a price increase in the DSO data. 
As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch up on trade stock that we will ship to. We have shipped under consumption now for 3 quarters. And I think as you can expect that we will -- as our America supply chain catches up, that you'll start to see us shipping above consumption. Now consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. consumer business. And then the market took all of that and it is just -- is still blasted through when we talk about inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock. It's still -- it's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. And I think that, that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year."

Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment.
We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, 2 fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond.
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile times as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift of consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption and eat as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. 
Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. And our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.
This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter and fiscal year results as well as the details of our 2021 guidance.
Turning to Slide 6. Starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line, versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with a partial offset from lower interest expense.
Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance. Starting on Slide 7, in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6% on constant currency, 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.
As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. To protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. And consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.
Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio. In spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. While fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints, this had double-digit growth for the year as did spices and seasonings and the other key categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. The majority of our categories continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.
While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the 5 weeks ending January 17 showed total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again.
In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on holiday proving to be successful. And our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and will continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation.
Now turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, and our Vahiné brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category.
In the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The foodservice industry is continuing to recover but at a gradual pace. Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.
Turning to Slide 8. Our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3%, and all 3 regions contributed to the sales growth. In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products.
Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice, growth of 2%. In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers, where we continue to see momentum in limited time offers and the core business, partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.
Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we have achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment, led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers.
We achieved $113 million of annual cost saves driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth. And there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.
2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements.
At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.
Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift to increase online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead.
We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments increasing 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again recognized as we were ranked as the #1 food brand, with the highest designation of GENIUS, by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. rankings. This is the seventh year in a row we were ranked in the top 5 food and beverage brands.
We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc top 50 company. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year as well as the #1 U.S. company overall and globally #6 overall.
Finally, during the year, we continued to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new ""state of the art"" Northeast distribution center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.
Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plans. 
Starting on Slide 11. In addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms through the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high-growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and foodservice operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors, increases the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration to more value-added and technically insulated products.
We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December, respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans, and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. 
We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extend its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, with our broad presence across all foodservice channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution in its existing foodservice channels as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers, combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends, expands the recipe inspiration and flavor solutions that we offer operators.
Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration, will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. 
With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. We're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods, including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus and fruit flavors. The combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better-for-you and consumer-preferred Flavor Solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. 
Our complementary customer bases of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA's customer-centric culture is very similar to ours. And with the combined power of our organization, we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition.
We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. This confidence is bolstered by a proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy, and both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. We're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, as well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown.
And in Australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption. And we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same in the Americas.
Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. And while there have been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our categories across the globe experienced a sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift in consumer preference, which, coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where through the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. 
Currently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top-selling products. We've now resumed shipping approximately 2/3 of the products, which had been suspended, with the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period, and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both our customers and McCormick, and I'd like to thank our customers for their partnership and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021, and we've implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth.
Also in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings to consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021. And with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth.
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, bringing real-time insights into actions by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration, for instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and product to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.
New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last 3 years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. 
Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year.
In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various stages of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum with packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic products as well as new products and bigger-bet innovation in 2021.  
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in most markets. In some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants, have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models toward delivery and carryout, the recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences.
Overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun, and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in Flavor Solutions and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships.
Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. With top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
The following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment.
Now Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance."
181176,700101529,2184007,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in con",2128,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.
Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year. Pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.
The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals, continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.
On Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes as well as private-label products due to capacity constraints.
In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago, with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, our Vahiné homemade dessert products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year, as Lawrence mentioned.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases, offset partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasonings. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5%, attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies with strength in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. 
Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. 
As seen on Slide 28. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year ago period as we had planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.
For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. 
The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% in constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by a 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs.
In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense, with a partial offset for CCI-led cost savings.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the full year was comparable to 2019. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. 
For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income, combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.
On Slide 32, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. 
We returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9x. And we expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.
Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we had in progress as well as support our investment to fuel future growth. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.
In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go-lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. 
Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs and, of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations.
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.
Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96, compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

We're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We're excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiment and flavors growth platform. We are confident these investments further position us for continued success.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times. 
Now let's turn to your questions."

I guess, first off, I'm curious if those dynamics are in such a place now where we should expect sort of shipments to start to outpace consumption sort of in 1Q and 2Q. Or if you expect still maybe somewhat of a lag effect because you're still building the capacity and the service levels to where you want them to be? 
Because I'm trying to just dimensionalize that sort of first quarter aspect. But more importantly, how to dimensionalize maybe how big of a benefit to 2001 organic growth just a rebuilding of inventory levels to the extent that needs to happen can be to organic growth? And then I just have a quick follow-up."

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter -- and well, really it's through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls.

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter -- and well, really it's through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls. And anybody that walks into a store can see that the shelves are pretty poor conditioned. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes that reflect the fact that we've had our secondary SKUs on suspension to protect the key holiday items. And it's really been those 2 categories that's had the greatest impact. 
Our other product categories has had pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. 
We have -- starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on. As we said in our prepared remarks, about 2/3 of them have been reinstated and the remainder coming in the coming weeks. So I think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. 
We still are allocating product. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries being a bit bare during this time as well. So we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year. And we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of Consumer inventory.
I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. It's just the scale of our Consumer business in the Americas is so great, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. Even in normal circumstances, we have to prebuild inventory to supply the huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. And coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have service issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. 
I will say, just commenting on current conditions, and I don't want to get too much into 2021. We were almost 2/3 of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers, while we're still allocating product, it's the best service that we've had since the spring."

Generally in China when the government gives encouragement to do something, they do it. And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior. 
It's not quite as clean as in Australia, where COVID seems to be under control. Restrictions have been lifted, and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home."

But Andrew, as a couple of other companies have commented on it, and I'll just say it again. Our consumer research, both the syndicated information that we get and our own proprietary research, says consumers are enjoying cooking more at home. 3 out of 4 consumers say it relaxes them. It reduces their stress. Probably 1/4 of consumers say they actually intend to cook more at home after the pandemic than they are even now.

I'll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are through the Flavor Solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on a contractual relationship where there's a pass-through of pricing. I don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. 
We are seeing cost inflations. Freight is up. Ocean freight, in particular, is an emerging -- a current and emerging concern. But we're really not prepared to talk about -- make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions.

And that comes through as pricing inflection in the Nielsen data. That is really kind of artificial, and that was one of the things that I was pointing to. 
And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board. That comes through as if it was a price increase in the Nielsen data.
As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch up on trade stock that we will ship to. We have shipped under consumption now for 3 quarters. And I think that you can expect that we will -- as our American supply chain catches up, that we'll -- you'll start to see us shipping above consumption. 
Now consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. Consumer business. And then the market took all of that and that has just -- it still blasted through. 
When we talk about inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock. It's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. And I think that, that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year."

So we did continue that effort, even with the pandemic going on. And we would expect to get a like number of stores again in 2021. Which is really between the 2 years is quite enough, it really moves the needle. And so we're continuing with those efforts that we think are important. 
This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the category. And so we've taken a look as part of this to -- it reduces the number of items in the store for their section. But we've also looked at the assortment that we offer, and we've SKU rationalized out part of the fairly long tail of products that we have to the tune of about 250 items in the -- purged by seasoning and recipe mix categories to simplify our assortment as well."

Starting on Slide 4. Our first quarter results were outstanding. As we said in our year-end earnings call in January, we have confidence in our strategies and are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021. 
Following an extraordinary year in 2020, in 2021, we expect strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and business transformation investments, highlighting our focus on profit realization. 
During the first quarter, we delivered double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth. We expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we have started the year with outstanding first quarter performance, giving us confidence in an even stronger outlook for 2021. 
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance, as evidenced again by our first quarter results. 
The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home continue to drive substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand in all regions as well as increases in our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, in our Americas and EMEA regions, we continue to experience reduced demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers given the pressure on away-from-home consumption driven by continued COVID-19 government-imposed restrictions, which in several areas increased during the first quarter. 
Notably, our APZ region had substantial growth in both segments, driven not only by lapping the significant disruption last year caused by the COVID-19-related lockdown in China but also by the sustained increase in at-home consumption and an increase in away-from-home consumption as restrictions have eased and the recovery momentum is building. 
Finally, with the addition of our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, we have further extended the reach and breadth of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers and are excited about their contributions to our first quarter and beyond. 
These impacts continued to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident our balanced portfolio will continue to differentiate McCormick and sustainably position us for growth. 
This morning, I will begin with our first quarter results, share some comments on business performance and then discuss our 2021 momentum and growth plans. After that, Mike will go more in depth on our first quarter results and provide an update on our 2021 guidance. 
Starting with our outstanding first quarter results, as seen on Slide 6. Total sales grew 22%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 20% with increases in both segments. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions, our 3 long-term growth drivers, all contributed to the increase. 
In addition to our top line growth, adjusted operating income increased 35%, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. And adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points. Growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19-related costs and higher planned brand marketing investments. 
Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 compared to $0.54 in the prior year, driven by our strong operating performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate. 
Turning to our first quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7. In our Consumer segment, we grew sales by 35% or constant currency, 32%, with double-digit increases across each of our 3 regions. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 30% in the first quarter, with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 5%. Momentum Cholula carried in from last year continues to be strong, with consumption growing at twice the category rate. Excluding Cholula, our total McCormick U.S.-branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 15%, which reflects the strength of our category as consumers continue to cook more at home. 
For the first time in several quarters, our sales increase was higher than our U.S. IRI consumption growth. We are realizing the benefit of our capacity expansion at the end of last year. The difference between shipments and consumption is attributable to beginning to catch up on the undershipment of consumption across all quarters of last year that resulted in depleted retailer and consumer pantry inventory. Demand has remained high and the steps we've taken to increase supply are beginning to show. 
As we mentioned in our January earnings call, after experiencing real pressure on our U.S. manufacturing operations throughout 2020 due to elevated demand levels, we ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity and restoration plans for products which have been suspended. Throughout our first quarter, we removed products from suspension and continued to see service levels improved, which, combined with our overshipping consumption, indicates we are beginning to refill the inventory pipeline. 
As we said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. We continue to work with all our customers on improving shelf conditions and estimate more than half the suspended products are now back on shelf. The level of restoration is very customer-specific. 
Focusing further on our U.S.-branded portfolio. In spice and seasonings and all other categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew first quarter consumption at double-digit rates and again increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. 
In the first quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints including stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. 
The categories most impacted by supply constraints, spice and seasonings and dry recipe mix, we know there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. Products that have had strong supply and remained on shelves have performed well. As suspended products are restocked on shelf, we're seeing similar performance. We anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve. 
All of our key categories continued to outpace the center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry’s, Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Zatarain's and Kitchen Basics. 
And in e-commerce, we had strong double-digit pure-play growth, with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories. 
We continue to use our strong category management capabilities and working with our customers as inventory is replenished throughout the supply chain to optimize category shelves that drive both growth for our customers and for McCormick. I'd like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us a long-term solution. We are well positioned for success in 2021 and have implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency to support continued growth. 
Now turning to EMEA, which continued its momentum with outstanding performance in the first quarter. Our constant currency sales rose 26%, with broad-based growth across the region. Each of our markets drove double-digit total branded consumption growth, with market share gains across the region. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, driving a market share gain across total EMEA region. And our Vahiné brand in France, again, had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. In the U.K., both Frank's Redhot and French's Mustard also had strong consumption and gained share. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand, and this has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region. 
In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased again in the first quarter or the fourth consecutive quarter across our major brands and markets compared to last year. And we continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that elevated consumer demand will be met, even obtaining incremental placement for our branded portfolio as other manufacturers and private label faced supply challenges. We're excited with our growth trajectory in EMEA following the challenging market conditions in the past. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 55%. During the first quarter of last year, China's consumption was disrupted by the COVID-19-related lockdown. Recovering from that disruption increased sales in the first quarter of 2021 versus last year. Notwithstanding that recovery, the region still had double-digit growth, driven by strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially fueled by the Chinese New Year holiday as well as strong consumer consumption in the rest of the region. For instance, in Australia, we continue to see elevated consumption in the brands where we gained household penetration last year, such as Frank's Redhot, Gourmet Garden and Grill Mates. 
Across all regions, we know second quarter consumption will start to be compared to the highly elevated levels from last year. And while we do not expect consumption at those same levels, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. 
Constant currency sales in our Flavor Solutions segment grew 3%, driven by our Americas and APZ regions. In the Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 2%, driven by our FONA and Cholula acquisitions as well as growth with our consumer packaged food customers for our at-home base.
With strengthened base business as well as new product momentum, we continue to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products, not only with the combination of bonus flavor portfolio but also with considerable growth from snack seasonings in the U.S. and Mexico as well as flavors from both savory and beverage applications. Demand from our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers declined and continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 environment. 
Sales in our EMEA region were comparable to the first quarter of last year for Flavor Solutions, with demand declines in our away-from-home customer base, offset by strong sales for our consumer packaged food customers. This growth was driven by a significant increase in new product growth versus last year, as well as continued strength in the base business, partially from our customers' promotional activities. 
Our sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was outstanding, up 18% in constant currency. Both China, excluding the recovery impact from last year's lockdown, and Australia delivered double-digit growth from quick service restaurants or QSR customers. This growth was driven by significant momentum in limited time offers as well as strength in the core business. 
I mentioned our results related to Cholula and FONA, and now I'd like to provide a brief update on their integration status. For both acquisitions, our integration activities are progressing according to our plan. We continue to deliver on opportunities quickly and aggressively to drive growth and are pleased with our momentum on capturing our synergy opportunities. We remain on track to achieve synergies according to plan. 
Starting with Cholula. As expected, our integration of the business has been straightforward. As of March 1, all functions have been integrated into our McCormick processes, and importantly, we are now servicing customers from our McCormick U.S. distribution center. From a consumer commercial perspective, we are expanding distribution and are fueling growth with robust brand marketing investments. We'll be activating both digital, where Cholula was underpenetrated, and in-store merchandising in the next few weeks for our exciting Cinco de Mayo campaign. 
In Flavor Solutions, we're also expanding distribution with new and existing branded foodservice customers and are leveraging Cholula's authentic Mexican flavor for increased menu participation, particularly in Cinco de Mayo menu offerings. 
Moving to FONA. The employees of FONA have been part of building a great business, and we are excited to be working with them to collectively integrate the business and drive plans to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our [ functional ] integration is very much on track and is using a best of both approach to ensure we optimize our operating model, similar to the approach we have with our RB Foods integration. The alignment of our organization is well underway and we have had significant commercial collaboration yielding quick wins and identifying long-term strategic opportunities. Customer reaction has been extremely positive. They are impressed with our early collaboration and excited about the increased customer value proposition created by the combination of McCormick and FONA, a more comprehensive product offering, broader technical platform, deep technical and labor talent and best-in-class customer collaboration. And we are excited with FONA's performance starting the year, with great results and a robust momentum across the business. 
For both Cholula and FONA, we are pleased with our progress so far and their contribution to our results, our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and are confident that we will deliver on our acquisition plans to accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only increased over the last few months. 
I would like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 10. 
Global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. We are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose mind of practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic and our alignment with them, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. 
These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plans position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments. 
Turning to Slide 11, starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. 
Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, with approximately 90% of restaurants opened during the Chinese New Year period. 
In Australia, even restaurant -- even with restaurant restriction [indiscernible] and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. And as I mentioned earlier, we are retaining households that came into our brands last year and we're also realizing growth with our away-from-home customers. 
In many of our largest markets in EMEA, restrictive COVID-19 measures are still in place, further fueling at-home consumption and we are seeing sustained levels of demand. 
In the Americas, as restrictions are easing and vaccinations are continuing, consumption remains elevated. Consumers are continuing to come to our brand, having a good experience and buying our products again. 
Consumers are cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasion [indiscernible] is a key long-term trend which has accelerated during the pandemic. As we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience as it provides a creative outlook, reduces stress and connect to the family. And consumers feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. 
In our recent consumer survey from February, these positive sentiments are not only still true but have strengthened. Consumers' interest in cooking has increased in recent months versus the end of last year because they want to cook versus have to cook. For example, approximately 50% of the consumer surveys indicated they are cooking more now because they want to try a new recipe, ingredient, cooking method or tools or simply just cook from scratch. And approximately 40% also indicated they're trying to recreate restaurant meals at home. Importantly, over 2/3 of consumers surveyed claims they will maintain or increase their current level of cooking at home even if life were to return to normal next week, whatever normal may be. We continue to believe the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond, fueled by robust brand marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to continue to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both us and our customers. In the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings for consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration, transforming and at times [ confusing shelf  ]to 3 shoppable sections. Our rollout has continued in 2021, with plans to implement in thousands of stores, and the early indication is positive, both the category and McCormick-branded growth outpacing the rest of the market in transformed stores. 
We are also investing in e-commerce to drive McCormick and category growth. In the first quarter, we delivered over 90% global e-commerce growth with particular strength in omnichannel. We are investing in content, retailer search and innovation specifically for e-commerce, trialing new items of packaging in the direct-to-consumer channel first. 
For example, in the Americas, we've launched unique, [ flavor ] inspiration products, such as Frank's RedHot everything [indiscernible] seasoning. And in China, we are launching a ready to eat chili paste on our direct-to-consumer platform. In EMEA, following the successful launch of the innovative street food seasonings last year, we are now accelerating online growth with variety, bundle packs and multi buy offers on our main e-commerce channels. 
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, as evident in our 17% increase in the first quarter and plan for another significant increase in the second quarter. Our investments have proven to be effective and we will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action by targeting, messaging focused on providing information and inspiration. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020. 
Highlighting some of our first quarter investments in the Americas and EMEA regions on Slide 12. 
Starting with the Americas. We continued our advertising campaign It's Gonna Be Great with a focus on consumers' continuing traditions and preparing their family's signature holiday dishes, even if their celebrations looks different. Our Frank's Super Bowl campaign integrated across digital, social, online video and TV, featured fan favorite [ Eli Manning ], promoting Frank's Redhot as approachably hot and was our best Super Bowl campaign yet, garnering record-high impressions. 
As part of our Zatarain's bold like that campaign, we partnered with New Orlenian author and poet [indiscernible] to promote virtual Mardi Gras celebrations with authentic New Orleans flavors, [ #veteransportsparty ]. And recognizing virtual celebrations replaced live Mardi Gras event, we supported culture aid NOLA, an organization, which distributes food to hospitality workers impacted by pandemic restrictions. 
Turning to EMEA, where we have invested a substantial portion of our brand marketing, our digital marketing and promotional activities included our holiday campaign featuring a festive gold cap limited edition packaging which drove strong holiday results in our major markets. 
In the U.K., with our New Year flavor resolutions campaign, we inspired consumers with recipes and products to flavor their healthy cake, whether it be through the heat of Frank's or spicing it up with Schwartz. 
And in France, we're giving families another reason to celebrate in 2021. In 2020, birthday celebrations were not just a piece of cake. So with the inspiration of our Half-py Birthday marketing campaign, consumers can celebrate their half birthday, complete with [indiscernible] of a decimal [indiscernible] fake candle top their cakes made with our Vahine baking products. 
Looking at just a few of our second quarter plan. In the Americas, we'll inspire restaurant quality cooking for It's Gonna Be Great campaign. 
Our Vahine brand in EMEA is sponsoring a prime time French baking program, which will showcase our homemade dessert line. 
In both regions, we launched Easter campaigns to bring the family together with baking and crafting ideas. 
And moving to growing seasons, we will acknowledge the importance of connecting through outdoor grilling occasions, with campaigns targeting products such as French's and Grill Mates in the U.S. and Frank's in the U.K. 
Finally, our plan includes support of our robust new product launches. New products are integral to our growth. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. Our 2020 launches [indiscernible] exceptional trial and are providing significant momentum into this year. And in 2021, we have a robust global pipeline of new product launches, and I'm happy to share some of our first half launches as seen on Slide 13. 
We are meeting consumers at the intersection of flavor and health. We're launching just 5 dry recipe mixes in the U.S., dips and dressing mixes and flavors like French Onion and home style ranch with clean and short ingredient statements, 5 simple ingredients delivering a classic flavor experience. 
And in France, we are expanding our range of organic products in our Vahine homemade dessert line. 
When it comes to heat, we're continuing to broaden our French portfolio globally. In the U.S., we're expanding French's wing sauces with a milder tangy buffalo flavor and a garlic buffalo flavor, we're combining savory garlic with spicy heat. 
Also in the U.S., we have just launched Cholula Wing sauces in 2 flavors: Mexicali Cilantro Line and [indiscernible] Spicy Herbal [ Peppers ] in a unique bottle with the iconic wooden cap. 
And in the U.K., we're launching Frank's craft edition, capitalizing on interest in Frank's heat with differentiated flavors such as roasted jalapeno and grilled Habanero. 
We are responding to consumers' demand for convenience and flavor. In the U.S., our launch of frozen appetizers, providing hot chicken bites and buffalo chicken dips with Frank's flavor that are ready in minutes is gaining momentum as one of our best new product starts. 
We're excited to launch our new Grill Mates all-purpose grilling seasoning for consumers who want to respect the meat. Simple course ground seasoning for the open plan that cling to the meat and lock in juiciness. 
Finally, our innovation is not only all about flavor, but also staying relevant for their consumers through our packaging innovation. We're continuing the rollout of our first choice bottle with its consumer preferred, transparent and functional design, modern look and reinforcement of fresh flavor into our Eastern European market. These markets have predominantly been sachet markets for spices and seasonings and perceived the bottle packaging as a premium offering. 
And in Canada, we're beginning the relaunch of our gourmet line in the first choice bottle as well as adding new flavor varieties. 
In the U.K., not only are we building on our Schwartz recipe mix momentum with the introduction of flavorful line extensions, we're also advancing on our sustainable packaging commitment with sachet packaging that is 100% recyclable. 
Schwartz will be the first brand in the U.K. dry recipe mix category with recyclable packaging. 
And in France, with the redesign of our Ducros grinder, its appearance not only has greater consumer appeal, but it also reduces our carbon footprint. 
Turning to Flavor Solutions In this segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various states of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customers. Overall, we are carrying our growth momentum with these customers into 2021, driven by strength in their iconic core products as well as new products and bigger bet innovation in 2021. Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovation from these customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on the shelf. There's still new product launches, and in many cases, they were smaller expansions of the core and more channel-oriented. 
Moving into 2021, we're excited about the momentum of the 2020 launches, but even more excited about the robust 2021 pipeline. Our customers have bigger bet innovations in their plan, and we look forward to collaborating with them and driving growth from those launches. 
A key enabler driving our success in developing winning flavors for our customers is our insight on consumer and culinary trends. We've been at the forefront of forecasting [indiscernible] flavors for 21 years. Through the McCormick flavor forecast, we have a history of identifying the top trends and ingredients shaping the future of flavor, many of which have stood the test of time, whether it was the turmeric or pumpkin pie spices, the flavor of Chipotle or dishes with quinoa. In April, we'll be launching our newest addition that will shake up the way we cook, flavor and eat. It will feature new trends, flavors and recipes that will not only flavor our Consumer segment innovation, but also drive wins with our Flavor Solutions customer. 
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing growth from our restaurant and other food service customers in our APZ regions as restrictions have eased. Its USR demand momentum continues to strengthen, particularly as they continue to expand their menu options with limited time offers and are increasing promotional activities. Branded foodservice demand, as it relates to entertainment, stadium or hospitality venues, for instance, is recovering at a slower pace. 
In EMEA and the Americas, during the first quarter, our restaurant and other foodservice customers were still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in many markets. There's now optimism with many of these customers related to restrictions easing and reopening plants. Focus has shifted from adapting operating models to supply chain preparedness for the second half of the year. We're collaborating with our customers to ensure a strong recovery with pent-up demand being met. We expect the recovery of some of our branded food customers will start to begin, similar to what we've seen in APZ. 
As QSR customers are oriented less to dine-in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. 
Across our entire Flavor Solutions portfolio, we are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we'll continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage the recovery plans and, importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships. 
When we collaborate with our customers and our technical innovation centers, we have a high win rate. Since we could not connect in person during 2020, we adapted to new ways of collaborating through creative digital and virtual solutions. The interactive experience for our customers build their excitement, awareness and confidence in our unique capabilities in an engaging and inspiring way. We continue to not only strengthen our engagement in 2020, but we also proved we could maintain our high win rate, whether physically in our innovation centers or not, and have carried that momentum into 2021. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically-insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. The top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy. 
Lastly, we continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet, our purpose-led performance. Following being named by Corporate Knights in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the packaged food and processed foods and ingredients sector, McCormick was also recently named to Barron's 2021 100 most sustainable companies list for the fourth consecutive year. 
As we continue our sustainability journey, I'm excited to announce that later this week, we will begin using 100% renewable electricity in all our Maryland- and New Jersey-based facilities. This includes our manufacturing operations, distribution centers, offices and technical innovation centers and will result in an 11% reduction in our global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Moving to Slide 16. In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment and with our Flavor Solutions at-home customers, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions away-from-home recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. 
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum and the breadth and reach of our portfolio reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. 
Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions, driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization. 
Our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and and we're positioned for continued success. 
Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike."
181176,706151356,2244621,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 30, 2021",2021-03-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'll now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. Starting with our top line gro",1838,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'll now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. 
As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. Starting with our top line growth. As seen on Slide 18, we grew sales 20% in constant currency during the first quarter. Higher volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributed to the increase. 
Our organic sales growth was 16%, driven by our Consumer segment. And incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. 
The Consumer segment sales grew 32% in constant currency with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. The sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives and resulted in higher volume and mix in each region. 
On Slide 19, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 30% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2020, with 5% of the increase from the acquisition of Cholula. The remaining increase from higher volume and product mix was broad-based across the majority of categories and brands as well as private label products, with particular strength in the McCormick Frank's RedHot, French's, Zatarain's, Lawry’s, Simply Asia and Gourmet Garden brands. 
In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales growth grew 26% from 1 year ago, with double-digit growth in all countries and categories across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were Schwartz-and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, Vahine dessert products, Thai Kitchen products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. 
Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 55% in constant currency, driven primarily by the recovery from the disruption in China consumption last year, as Lawrence mentioned. Excluding that recovery impact, the region had double-digit growth due to strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially driven by the timing of Chinese New Year and related holiday promotions as well as continued strength in Australia. 
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 22, we grew first quarter constant currency sales 3%. 
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2%, driven by the FONA and Cholula acquisitions, a 7% increase as well as pricing to offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies, with particular strength in snack seasonings and savory flavors. 
In the EMEA, constant currency sales were comparable to last year as pricing actions offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies, with strength in snack seasonings. 
In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 18% in constant currency driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as the China recovery impact from last year's COVID-19-related lockdown. 
As seen on Slide 26, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, increased 35%, or in constant currency, 32% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. 
The Consumer segment adjusted operating income grew 59% to $190 million. The 54% constant currency growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19-related costs and a 17% increase in brand marketing. 
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 4% to $73 million with minimal impact from currency. Higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted gross profit margin expanded 60 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period due to favorable mix, both within the Consumer segment and due to the sales shift between segments. In addition, CCI-led cost savings were partially offset by COVID-19-related costs. 
Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Leverage from sales growth drove the decline, partially offset by the increase in brand marketing I mentioned a moment ago. 
With the gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. 
Turning to income taxes on Slide 28. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 18.4% in the year ago period. The first quarter adjusted tax rate in 2020 was significantly impacted by a favorable discrete item related to a refinement of our entity structure. 
Income from unconsolidated operations increased 28% in the first quarter of 2021 due to strong underlying performance of our joint venture in Mexico. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 30, first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 as compared to $0.54 for the year ago period. The increase was due to our higher adjusted operating income performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate. 
On Slide 31, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an outflow of $32 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to an inflow of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. This change was primarily due to a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. 
In February, we raised $1 billion for the issuance of 5-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 
We also returned $91 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $49 million for capital expenditures this quarter. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to fuel growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 32 and 33. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. 
In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investments as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. 
We also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, due to our first quarter results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 6% to 8% compared to 5% to 7% previously, which continues to include the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions at the projected range of 3.5% to 4%. 
We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. 
As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region in quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we continue to expect we will drive overall organic sales growth for the full year in both of our segments. 
We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be comparable to 2020 due to increasing inflationary pressure, mainly due to transportation costs. But our inflation expectation for the full year remains a low single-digit increase. 
Our adjusted gross margin projection reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisition as well as unfavorable sales mix to the segments and COVID-19 costs. 
Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2021 COVID-19 costs are largely from third-party manufacturing costs. 
Reflecting the increase in our sales outlook, we are also increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 11% to 13% constant currency growth compared to 10% to 12% previously. This is partially offset by a 1% impact from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% impact of the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 7% to 9% in constant currency, increased from 6% to 8% previously. This projection reflects the inflationary pressure I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. 
We also continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. 
We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
We are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long-term financing, which I mentioned earlier. 
Our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02 compared to $2.91 to $2.96 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 11% to 13% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. 
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. 
Our first quarter's performance was a strong start to the year, and we are optimistic for the balance of the year. But we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020, while also making investments to drive growth in 2021. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. 
I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 34. 
Our first quarter results with double digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth were an outstanding start to the year and bolster our confidence in a stronger 2021 outlook. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio which drives consistency in our performance. We are confident the sustainability of higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic, and we are well positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends as well as prepared for away-from-home consumption recovery. 
Cholula and FONA have both started the year with strong momentum and results. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our plans has only strengthened over the last few months. 
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond.

But any -- you or anyone on this call and certainly my friends and family who talked to me about this endlessly, can walk into any store and find that there are a lot of holes on the shelf and a lot of our products that are not yet in full distribution. And even within a given account, the store-by-store situation, it might be different. There's a supply chain aspect to it. There's a retail work aspect to getting on the shelf. And I think that this is going to be a steady rebuild as we go through the rest of the year. We've made a good start on it in Q1, but we have quite a long way to go. And it's -- I would hesitate to get overly precise about it. I would expect to see the shelf getting restored as we go through the year. 
I think one of the big variables for us, Andrew, is just the strength of the consumer demand. Consumer demand has been higher than we originally planned. And so we're actually not as far along in our restoration plan as we would have hoped. That's because as fast as we supply the market, consumers are pulling the product through. I do think that it's hard -- I'd say it's hard for us to dimensionalize. 
I will emphasize it's an Americas problem. Most of the world, we are shipping to consumption. Our supply chain is well caught up. Our service levels are solid. It's in the Americas where we've got some catching up to do. 
And in most categories here in the Americas, we're also shipping to consumption as well. It's primarily herbs and spices and our recipe mixes situation. 
I think you're going to see a big change in the TDPs as we go through the coming weeks. And I think I'm sure we've hit bottom on that and have already turned the corner just because of the restoration efforts."

I think during the first quarter, there were a lot of -- because everyone thinks about the state we're in today, but think about December and January, there were a lot of new lockdowns that were put in place, restrictions that had been lifted were reinstated. So I'd say that the branded foodservice side, the restaurant customers, might be off to a little bit slower start to the year than everyone may be thinking. 
I do think there's a lot of optimism among restaurant operators as we go into the second quarter and as the vaccination rates go up and many of these restrictions are lifted. And I think that, that group will come back stronger. But certainly for the beginning of the year, they're up to a little bit of a slower start."

What consumption continues, that's something we would assess as we always do. And as our supply chain continues to recover, that's another variable that could speed it up or slow it down. So those are all considered in our guidance."

I think it's interesting to look around the region also because what we're talking about is the Asia Pacific region, it's not just China, that's the biggest market there, but markets like Australia, which is also pretty far low in recovery. And even though foodservice has rebounded, it's not back to the same level that it once was and consumption of food at home has continued to be very strong. 
It goes to the point that we've been making, which is that this has been a long-term trend anyway for consumers to cook more at home and more from scratch at home when they do. And the COVID situation reinforced that behavior, that helped a whole new generation of cooks learn how to cook their family recipes that maybe they relied on mom or grandma or a new eating occasion or new eating occasions like lunch as people work remotely. I think there are a lot of reasons to believe that consumption at home is going to continue to be elevated."

As we said in our year-end earnings call in January, we have confidence in our strategies and are well positioned to delive",4907,"Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
Starting on Slide 4. Our first quarter results were outstanding. As we said in our year-end earnings call in January, we have confidence in our strategies and are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021. 
Following an extraordinary year in 2020, in 2021, we expect strong underlying base business performance and recent acquisitions to drive significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and business transformation investments, highlighting our focus on profit realization. 
During the first quarter, we delivered double-digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth. We expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we have started the year with outstanding first quarter performance, giving us confidence in an even stronger outlook for 2021. 
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance, as evidenced again by our first quarter results. 
The sustained shift in consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home continue to drive substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand in all regions as well as increases in our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, in our Americas and EMEA regions, we continue to experience reduced demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers given the pressure on away-from-home consumption driven by continued COVID-19 government-imposed restrictions, which in several areas, increased during the first quarter. Notably, our APZ region had substantial growth in both segments, driven not only by lapping the significant disruption last year caused by the COVID-19-related lockdown in China but also by the sustained increase in at-home consumption and an increase in away-from-home consumption as restrictions have eased and the recovery momentum is building. 
Finally, with the addition of our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, we have further extended the reach and breadth of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers and are excited about their contributions to our first quarter and beyond. 
These impacts continued to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident our balanced portfolio will continue to differentiate McCormick and sustainably position us for growth.  
This morning, I will begin with our first quarter results, share some comments on business performance and then discuss our 2021 momentum and growth plans. After that, Mike will go more in depth on our first quarter results and provide an update on our 2021 guidance.  
Starting with our outstanding first quarter results, as seen on Slide 6. Total sales grew 22%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 20% with increases in both segments. Base business growth, new products and acquisitions, our 3 long-term growth drivers, all contributed to the increase. In addition to our top line growth, adjusted operating income increased 35%, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. And adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points. Growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19-related costs and higher planned brand marketing investments. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 compared to $0.54 in the prior year, driven by our strong operating performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted tax rate.  
Turning to our first quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7. In our Consumer segment, we grew sales by 35%, or at constant currency, 32%, with double-digit increases across each of our 3 regions. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 30% in the first quarter, with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 5%. The momentum Cholula carried in from last year continues to be strong, with consumption growing at twice the category rate. 
Excluding Cholula, our total McCormick U.S.-branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, grew 15%, which reflects the strength of our category as consumers continue to cook more at home. For the first time in several quarters, our sales increase was higher than our U.S. IRI consumption growth. We are realizing the benefit of our capacity expansion at the end of last year. The difference between shipments and consumption is attributable to beginning to catch up on the undershipment of consumption across all quarters of last year that resulted in depleted retailer and consumer pantry inventory. Demand has remained high and the steps we've taken to increase supply are beginning to show.  
As we mentioned in our January earnings call, after experiencing real pressure on our U.S. manufacturing operations throughout 2020 due to elevated demand levels, we ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity and restoration plans for products which had been suspended. Throughout our first quarter, we removed products from suspension and continued to see service levels improved, which, combined with our overshipping consumption, indicates we are beginning to refill the inventory pipeline. As we said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. We continue to work with all our customers on improving shelf conditions and estimate more than half the suspended products are now back on shelf. The level of restoration is very customer-specific. 
Focusing further on our U.S.-branded portfolio. In spice and seasonings and all other categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew first quarter consumption at double-digit rates and again increased our household penetration and repeat buy rate. In the first quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinades and Asian product. The categories most impacted by supply constraints, spice and seasonings and dry recipe mix, we know there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. Products that have had strong supply and remained on shelf have performed well. And as suspended products are restocked on shelf, we're seeing similar performance. We anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve. 
All of our key categories continued to outpace the center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry?s, Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Zatarain's and Kitchen Basics. And in e-commerce, we had strong double-digit pure-play growth, with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories.  
We continue to use our strong category management capabilities and working with our customers as inventory is replenished throughout the supply chain as optimized category shelf sets drives both growth for our customers and for McCormick. I'd like to thank our customers for their partnerships and working together with us on long-term solutions. We are well positioned for success in 2021 and have implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency to support continued growth.  
Now turning to EMEA, which continued its momentum with outstanding performance in the first quarter. Our constant currency sales rose 26%, with broad-based growth across the region. Each of our markets drove double-digit total branded consumption growth, with market share gains across the region. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, driving a market share gain across total EMEA region. And our Vahiné brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. In the U.K., both Frank's RedHot and French's mustard also had strong consumption and gained share. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand, and this has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region.  
In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased again in the first quarter for the fourth consecutive quarter across our major brands and markets compared to last year. And we continue to work closely with our customers to ensure that elevated consumer demand will be met, even obtaining incremental placement for our branded portfolio as other manufacturers and private label faced supply challenges. We're excited with our growth trajectory in EMEA following the challenging market conditions in the past.  
In the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 55%. During the first quarter of last year, China's consumption was disrupted by the COVID-19-related lockdown. Recovering from that disruption increased sales in the first quarter of 2021 versus last year. Notwithstanding that recovery, the region still had double-digit growth, driven by strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially fueled by the Chinese New Year holiday as well as strong consumer consumption in the rest of the region. For instance, in Australia, we continued to see elevated consumption in the brands where we gained household penetration last year, such as Frank's RedHot, Gourmet Garden and Grill Mates.  
Across all regions, we know second quarter consumption will start to be compared to the highly elevated levels from last year. And while we do not expect consumption at those same levels, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home.  
Constant currency sales in our Flavor Solutions segment grew 3%, driven by our Americas and APZ regions. In the Americas, we drove constant currency sales growth of 2%, driven by our FONA and Cholula acquisitions as well as growth with our consumer packaged food customers for our at-home base. With strengthened base business as well as new product momentum, we continue to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products, not only with the combination of FONA's flavor portfolio, but also with considerable growth from snack seasonings in the U.S. and Mexico as well as flavors from both savory and beverage applications. Demand from our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers declined and continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 environment.  
Sales in our EMEA region were comparable to the first quarter of last year for Flavor Solutions, with demand declines in our away-from-home customer base, offset by strong sales for our consumer packaged food customers. This growth was driven by a significant increase in new product growth versus last year, as well as continued strength in the base business, partially from our customers' promotional activities.  
Our sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region was outstanding, up 18% in constant currency. Both China, excluding the recovery impact from last year's lockdown, and Australia delivered double-digit growth from quick service restaurants, or QSR, customers. This growth was driven by significant momentum in limited time offers as well as strength in the core business. 
I mentioned our results related to Cholula and FONA, and now I'd like to provide a brief update on their integration status. For both acquisitions, our integration activities are progressing according to our plan. We continue to deliver on opportunities quickly and aggressively to drive growth and are pleased with our momentum on capturing our synergy opportunities. We remain on track to achieve synergies according to plan. 
Starting with Cholula. As expected, our integration of the business has been straightforward. As of March 1, all functions have been integrated into our McCormick processes, and importantly, we are now servicing customers from our McCormick U.S. distribution center. From a consumer commercial perspective, we are expanding distribution and are fueling growth with robust brand marketing investments. We'll be activating both digital, where Cholula was underpenetrated, and in-store merchandising in the next few weeks for our exciting Cinco de Mayo campaign. In Flavor Solutions, we're also expanding distribution with new and existing branded foodservice customers and are leveraging Cholula's authentic Mexican flavor for increased menu participation, particularly in Cinco de Mayo menu offerings.  
Moving to FONA. The employees of FONA have been part of building a great business, and we are excited to be working with them to collectively integrate the business and drive plans to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our functional integration is very much on track and is using a best-of-both approach to ensure we optimize our operating model, similar to the approach we have with our RB Foods integration. The alignment of our organization is well underway and we have had significant commercial collaboration yielding quick wins and identifying long-term strategic opportunities. 
Customer reaction has been extremely positive. They are impressed with our early collaboration and excited about the increased customer value proposition created by the combination of McCormick and FONA, a more comprehensive product offering, broader technical platform, deep technical and flavor talent and best-in-class customer collaboration. And we are excited with FONA's performance starting the year, with great results and a robust momentum across the business. 
For both Cholula and FONA, we are pleased with our progress so far and their contribution to our results. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and are confident that we will deliver on our acquisition plans, accelerate growth of these portfolios and drive shareholder value has only increased over the last few months.  
Now I would like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 10. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth. We are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic, and our alignment with them, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plans position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.  
Turning to Slide 11, starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. 
Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, with approximately 90% of restaurants opened during the Chinese New Year period. 
In Australia, even restaurant -- even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. And as I mentioned earlier, we are retaining households that came into our brands last year and we're also realizing growth with our away-from-home customers. 
In many of our largest markets in EMEA, restrictive COVID-19 measures are still in place, further fueling at-home consumption and we are seeing sustained levels of demand. 
In the Americas, as restrictions are easing and vaccinations are continuing, consumption remains elevated. Consumers are continuing to come to our brand, having a good experience and buying our products again. 
Consumers are cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions, is a long -- is a key long-term trend which has accelerated during the pandemic. As we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data, supported by external research, indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience as it provides a creative outlet, reduces stress and connects the family. And consumers feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. 
In our recent consumer survey from February, these positive sentiments are not only still true but have strengthened. Consumers' interest in cooking has increased in recent months versus the end of last year because they want to cook versus have to cook. For example, approximately 50% of the consumers surveyed indicated they are cooking more now because they want to try a new recipe, ingredient, cooking method or tools or simply just cook from scratch. And approximately 40% also indicated they're trying to recreate restaurant meals at home. Importantly, over 2/3 of consumers surveyed claim they would maintain or increase their current level of cooking at home, even if life were to return to normal next week, whatever normal may be. 
We continue to believe the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond, fueled by robust brand marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to continue to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both us and our customers. In the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings for consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration, transforming, and at times, confusing, shelf to 3 shoppable sections. Our rollout has continued in 2021, with plans to implement in thousands of stores. And the early indication is positive with the category and McCormick-branded growth outpacing the rest of the market in transformed stores. 
We are also investing in e-commerce to drive McCormick and category growth. In the first quarter, we delivered over 90% global e-commerce growth with particular strength in omnichannel. We are investing in content, retailer search and innovation specifically for e-commerce, trialing new items and packaging in the direct-to-consumer channel first 
For example, in the Americas, we've launched unique flavor inspiration products, such as Frank's RedHot Everything Bagel Seasoning. And in China, we are launching a ready to eat chili paste on our direct-to-consumer platform. In EMEA, following the successful launch of the innovative street food seasonings last year, we are now accelerating online growth with variety, bundle packs and multi buy offers on our main e-commerce channels. 
Turning to global brand marketing. We continued to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, as evident in our 17% increase in the first quarter and plan for another significant increase in the second quarter. Our investments have proven to be effective and we will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action, by targeting messaging focused on providing information and inspiration. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020. 
Highlighting some of our first quarter investments in the Americas and EMEA regions on Slide 12. Starting with the Americas. We continued our advertising campaign It's Gonna Be Great with a focus on consumers continuing traditions and preparing their family's signature holiday dishes, even if their celebrations look different. 
Our Frank's Super Bowl campaign, integrated across digital, social, online video and TV, featured fan favorite Eli Manning, promoting Frank's RedHot as approachably hot and was our best Super Bowl campaign yet, garnering record-high impressions. 
As part of our Zatarain's Bold Like That campaign, we partnered with New Orleanian author and poet, Cleo Wade, to promote virtual Mardi Gras celebrations with authentic New Orleans flavors, #ZatarainsPorchParty. And recognizing virtual celebrations replaced live Mardi Gras event, we supported Culture AID NOLA, an organization which distributes food to hospitality workers impacted by pandemic restrictions. 
Turning to EMEA, where we have invested a substantial portion brand -- of our brand marketing, our digital marketing and promotional activities included our holiday campaign featuring our festive gold cap limited edition packaging which drove strong holiday results in our major markets.  
In the U.K., with our New Year Flavor Resolutions campaign, we inspired consumers with recipes and products to flavor their healthy kick, whether it be through the heat of Frank's or spicing it up with Schwartz.  
And in France, we're giving families another reason to celebrate in 2021. In 2020, birthday celebrations were not just a piece of cake. So with the inspiration of our Half-py Birthday marketing campaign, consumers can celebrate their half-birthdays, complete with Vahiné's launch of a decimal comma-shaped candle to top their cakes made with our Vahiné baking products.
Looking at just a few of our second quarter plan. In the Americas, we'll inspire restaurant-quality cooking with our It's Gonna Be Great campaign. Our Vahiné brand in EMEA is sponsoring a prime time French baking program which will showcase our homemade dessert line. In both regions, we've launched Easter campaigns to bring the family together with baking and crafting ideas. 
And moving to grilling season, we will acknowledge the importance of connecting through outdoor grilling occasions, with campaigns targeting products such as French's and Grill Mates in the U.S. and Frank's in the U.K. 
Finally, our plan includes support of our robust new product launches. New products are integral to our growth. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with our consumers. Our 2020 launches have gained exceptional trial and are providing significant momentum into this year. And in 2021, we have a robust global pipeline of new product launches, and I'm happy to share some of our first half launches as seen on Slide 13. 
We are meeting consumers at the intersection of flavor and health. We're launching Just 5 dry recipe mixes in the U.S., dips and dressing mixes and flavors like French onion and home style ranch, with clean and short ingredient statements, 5 simple ingredients delivering a classic flavor experience. 
And in France, we are expanding our range of organic products in our Vahiné homemade dessert line. 
When it comes to heat, we're continuing to broaden our French portfolio globally. In the U.S., we're expanding French's wing sauces. With a milder tangy buffalo flavor and a garlic buffalo flavor, we're combining savory garlic with spicy heat. Also in the U.S., we have just launched Cholula wing sauces in 2 flavors: Mexicali Cilantro Lime and Caliente Spicy Arbol Peppers in a unique bottle with the iconic wooden cap. And in the U.K., we're launching Frank's Craft Edition, capitalizing on interest in Frank's heat with differentiated flavors such as roasted jalapeno and grilled habanero. 
We are responding to consumers' demand for convenience and flavor. In the U.S., our launch of frozen appetizers, providing hot chicken bites and buffalo chicken dips with Frank's flavor that are ready in minutes is gaining momentum as one of our best new product starts. We're excited to launch our new Grill Mates all-purpose grilling seasoning for consumers who want to respect the meat. Simple, course-ground seasoning for the open flame that cling to the meat and lock in juiciness. 
Finally, our innovation is not only all about flavor, but also staying relevant for their consumers through our packaging innovation. We're continuing the rollout of our first choice bottle with its consumer-preferred transparent and functional design, modern look and reinforcement of fresh flavor into our Eastern European market. These markets have predominantly been sachet markets for spices and seasonings and perceived the bottle packaging as a premium offering. And in Canada, we're beginning the relaunch of our gourmet line in the first choice bottle as well as adding new flavor varieties in the U.K., not only are we building on our Schwartz recipe mix momentum with the introduction of flavorful line extensions, we're also advancing on our sustainable packaging commitment with sachet packaging that is 100% recyclable. Schwartz will be the first brand in the U.K. dry recipe mix category with recyclable packaging. And in France, with the redesign of our Ducros grinder, its appearance not only has greater consumer appeal, but it also reduces our carbon footprint.  
Turning to Flavor Solutions. In this segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen a varied -- various states of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customers. Overall, we are carrying our growth momentum with these customers into 2021, driven by strength in their iconic core product as well as new products and bigger bet innovation in 2021. Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovations from these customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on shelf. There's still new product launches, and in many cases, they were smaller expansions of the core and more channel-oriented. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the momentum of the 2020 launches, but even more excited about the robust 2021 pipeline. Our customers have bigger bet innovations in their plan, and we look forward to collaborating with them and driving growth from those launches. 
A key enabler driving our success in developing winning flavors for our customers is our insight on consumer and culinary trends. We've been at the forefront of forecasting emerging flavors for 21 years. Through the McCormick flavor forecast, we have a history of identifying the top trends and ingredients shaping the future of flavor, many of which have stood the test of time, whether it was with turmeric or pumpkin pie spices, the flavor of Chipotle or dishes with quinoa. In April, we'll be launching our newest addition that will shake up the way we cook, flavor and eat. We will feature new trends, flavors and recipes that will not only flavor our Consumer segment innovation, but also drive wins with our Flavor Solutions customer. 
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing growth from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in our APZ regions as restrictions have eased. In QSR, demand momentum continues to strengthen, particularly as they continue to expand their menu options with limited time offers and are increasing promotional activities. Branded foodservice demand, as it relates to entertainment, stadium or hospitality venues, for instance, is recovering at a slower pace. 
In EMEA and the Americas, during the first quarter, our restaurant and other foodservice customers were still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in many markets. There's now optimism with many of these customers related to restrictions easing and reopening plans. Focus has shifted from adapting operating models to supply chain preparedness for the second half of the year. We're collaborating with our customers to ensure a strong recovery with pent-up demand being met. We expect the recovery of some of our branded food customers will start to begin, similar to what we've seen in APZ. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine-in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum.  
Across our entire Flavor Solutions portfolio, we are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we'll continue to drive new product wins; collaborate on opportunities and solutions; manage the recovery plans; and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships.  
When we collaborate with our customers in our technical innovation centers, we have a high win rate. Since we could not connect in person during 2020, we adapted to new ways of collaborating through creative digital and virtual solutions. The interactive experience for our customers build their excitement, awareness and confidence in our unique capabilities in an engaging and inspiring way. We continue to not only strengthen our engagement in 2020, but we also proved we could maintain our high win rate, whether physically in our innovation centers or not, and have carried that momentum into 2021. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. The top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy. 
Lastly, we continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet, our purpose-led performance. Following being named by Corporate Knights in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the packaged food and processed foods and ingredients sector, McCormick was also recently named to Barron's 2021 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for the fourth consecutive year. As we continue our sustainability journey, I'm excited to announce that later this week, we will begin using 100% renewable electricity in all our Maryland- and New Jersey-based facilities. This includes our manufacturing operations, distribution centers, offices and technical innovation centers, and will result in an 11% reduction in our global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Moving to Slide 16. In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment and with our Flavor Solutions at-home customers, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions away-from-home recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategy, our robust operating momentum and the breadth and reach of our portfolio reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. 
Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization. Our top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we're positioned for continued success. 
Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike."

I'll now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. Starting with our top line gro",1838,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I'll now provide some additional comments on our first quarter performance and an update on our 2021 outlook. As Lawrence mentioned, our first quarter results were outstanding. 
Starting with our top line growth. As seen on Slide 18, we grew sales 20% in constant currency during the first quarter. Higher volume and product mix, acquisitions and pricing each contributed to the increase. Our organic sales growth was 16%, driven by our Consumer segment. And incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributed 4% across both segments. 
The Consumer segment sales grew 32% in constant currency with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. The sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives and resulted in higher volume and mix in each region. 
On Slide 19, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 30% in constant currency versus the first quarter of 2020, with 5% of the increase from the acquisition of Cholula. The remaining increase from higher volume and product mix was broad-based across the majority of categories and brands as well as private label products, with particular strength in the McCormick, Frank's RedHot, French's, Zatarain's, Lawry’s, Simply Asia and Gourmet Garden brands. 
In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales growth grew 26% from 1 year ago with double-digit growth in all countries and categories across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were Schwartz-and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, Vahiné homemade dessert products, Thai Kitchen products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. 
Consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 55% in constant currency, driven primarily by the recovery from the disruption in China consumption last year, as Lawrence mentioned. Excluding that recovery impact, the region had double-digit growth due to strong China consumer and branded foodservice demand, partially driven by the timing of Chinese New Year and related holiday promotions as well as continued strength in Australia. 
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 22. We grew first quarter constant currency sales 3%. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2%, driven by the FONA and Cholula acquisitions, a 7% increase as well as pricing to offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies, with particular strength in snack seasonings and savory flavors. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales were comparable to last year as pricing actions offset cost increases. Volume and product mix declined due to lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers, partially offset by sales growth with packaged food companies, with strength in snack seasonings. 
In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 18% in constant currency driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as the China recovery impact from last year's COVID-19-related lockdown. 
As seen on Slide 26, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, increased 35%, or in constant currency, 32% in the first quarter versus the year ago period. The Consumer segment adjusted operating income grew 59% to $190 million. The 54% constant currency growth from higher sales, favorable mix and CCI-led cost savings more than offset COVID-19-related costs and a 17% increase in brand marketing. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 4% to $73 million with minimal impact from currency. Higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted gross profit margin expanded 60 basis points in the first quarter versus the year ago period due to favorable mix, both within the Consumer segment and due to the sales shift between segments. In addition, CCI-led cost savings were partially offset by COVID-19-related costs. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was down year-on-year by 100 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Leverage from sales growth drove the decline, partially offset by the increase in brand marketing I mentioned a moment ago. With the gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. 
Turning to income taxes on Slide 28. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 18.4% in the year ago period. The first quarter adjusted tax rate in 2020 was significantly impacted by a favorable discrete item related to a refinement of our entity structure. 
Income from unconsolidated operations increased 28% in the first quarter of 2021 due to strong underlying performance of our joint venture in Mexico. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 30, first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.72 as compared to $0.54 for the year ago period. The increase was due to our higher adjusted operating income performance, partially offset by a higher adjusted income tax rate. 
On Slide 31, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was an outflow of $32 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to an inflow of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. This change was primarily due to a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. 
In February, we raised $1 billion through the issuance of 5-year 0.9% notes and 10-year 1.85% notes. We took the opportunity in a low interest rate environment to optimize our long-term financing following our Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 
We also returned $91 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $49 million for capital expenditures this quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to fuel growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 32 and 33. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investments as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We also expect there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, due to our first quarter results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 6% to 8% compared to 5% to 7% previously, which continues to include the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions at the projected range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. 
As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we continue to expect we will drive overall organic sales growth for the full year in both of our segments. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be comparable to 2020 due to increasing inflationary pressure, mainly due to transportation costs. But our inflation expectation for the full year remains a low single-digit increase. Our adjusted gross margin projection reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisition as well as unfavorable sales mix to both segments and COVID-19 costs. Our estimate for COVID-19 costs remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely from third-party manufacturing costs. 
Reflecting the increase in our sales outlook, we are also increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions projected to be 11% to 13% constant currency growth compared to 10% to 12% previously. This is partially offset by a 1% impact from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% impact of the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 7% to 9% in constant currency, increased from 6% to 8% previously. This projection reflects the inflationary pressure I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. We also continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year. 
We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate, projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
We are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5% to 7%, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long-term financing which I mentioned earlier. Our guidance range for the adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02 compared to $2.91 to $2.96 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 11% to 13% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. 
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our first quarter's performance was a strong start to the year, and we are optimistic for the balance of the year. But we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020 while also making investments to drive growth in 2021. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. 
I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I'd like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 34. 
Our first quarter results with double digit sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth were an outstanding start to the year and bolster our confidence in a stronger 2021 outlook. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio which drives consistency in our performance. We are confident the sustainability of higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic, and we are well positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends as well as prepared for away-from-home consumption recovery. 
Cholula and FONA have both started the year with strong momentum and results. Our enthusiasm for these acquisitions and our confidence that we will deliver on our plans has only strengthened over the last few months. 
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will continue on our growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond.

It sounds like there's still some more to go as you move through the year, I guess, particularly in 2Q. Is there any way you can maybe dimensionalize that a bit on how significant that refill might be in 2Q? Even if it's like versus the magnitude of what you saw in 1Q, just to try and put some context around it. 
And have you had any challenges in getting some of those suspended items back on the shelf at all? Because I know that in Europe, you mentioned you had actually benefited from incremental shelf placement at the expense of some competitors that had some capacity issues. I didn't know if the reverse had been an issue for you here. And then I've just got a follow-up."

Well, as we've gone through the COVID crisis in 2020, we undershipped consumption every quarter because we were not able to keep up with the extended, elevated levels of demand overall. And in order to keep our best-selling items; our core items; and in particular as we got to the fall, protect the holiday items, we did suspend a substantial number of items. And hence, we've added capacity. We've been steadily restoring them as we've gone through this first quarter of this year. 
And I'd say that right now, we probably are around the halfway point in terms of getting items back on the shelf. But any -- you or anyone on this call and certainly my friends and family, who hector me about this endlessly, can walk into any store and find that there are a lot of holes on the shelf and a lot of our products that are not yet in full distribution. And even within a given account, the store-by-store situation, it might be different. There's a supply chain aspect to it, there's a retail work aspect to getting on the shelf. And I think that this is going to be a steady rebuild as we go through the rest of the year. I know we've made a good start on it in Q1, but we have quite a long way to go. And it's -- I would hesitate to get overly precise about it. I would expect to see the shelf getting restored as we go through the year. 
I think one of the big variables for us, Andrew, is just the strength of the consumer demand. Consumer demand has been higher than we originally planned. And so we're actually not as far along in our restoration plans as we would have hoped. That's because, as fast as we supply the market, consumers are pulling the product through. But I do think that it's hard -- I'd say it's hard for us to dimensionalize. 
I will emphasize it's an Americas problem. Most of the world, we are shipping to consumption. And our supply chain is well caught up. Our service levels are solid. And it's in the Americas where we've got some catching up to do. And in most categories here in the Americas, we're also shipping to consumption as well. It's primarily a herbs and spices and our recipe mixes situation. 
I think you're going to see a big change in the TDPs as we go through the coming weeks. And I think I'm sure we've hit bottom on that and have already turned the corner just because of the restoration efforts that we..."

So I'd say that the branded foodservice side, the restaurant customers, might be off to a little bit slower start to the year than everyone may be thinking. 
I do think there's a lot of optimism among restaurant operators as we go into the second quarter and as the vaccination rates go up and many of these restrictions are lifted.

Kind of leading into your second question, that [ co-man ] was coming in, the first quarter wasn't a full impact of the [ co-man ] cost as we've ramped things up. So really, the second quarter is where that would be, every month, we'll have the full [ co-man ] costs. So that's a little bit of a headwind in the second quarter. 
We talked about the first quarter, our Consumer A&P was up around 17%. We're going to have another investment of A&P in the second quarter to drive sales, as we said. So again, that's part of the front -- first half, second half story. 
So I think Q2 has a bit of a headwind from an expense perspective and a COVID and an A&P cost perspective, and also the tax rate. They're going down to the EPS line."

During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted leverage ratio that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA and for 2019, the net nonrecurring benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release and slides.
As a reminder, we completed a 2:1 stock split at the end of our fiscal 2020. As a result, all per share amounts mentioned today, which will be also included in our 10-K, reflect the retroactive presentation of those amounts on a split adjusted basis. In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. Please refer to our presentation for complete information.

I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment.
We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, 2 fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond.
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile times as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift of consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption and eat as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. 
Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. And our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.
This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter and fiscal year results as well as the details of our 2021 guidance.
Turning to Slide 6. Starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line, versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with a partial offset from lower interest expense.
Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance. Starting on Slide 7, in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6% on constant currency, 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.
As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. To protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. And consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.
Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio. In spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. While fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints, this had double-digit growth for the year as did spices and seasonings and the other key categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. The majority of our categories continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.
While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the 5 weeks ending January 17 showed total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again.
In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on holiday proving to be successful. And our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and will continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation.
Now turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, and our Vahiné brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category.
In the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The foodservice industry is continuing to recover but at a gradual pace. Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.
Turning to Slide 8. Our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3%, and all 3 regions contributed to the sales growth. In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products.
Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice, growth of 2%. In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers, where we continue to see momentum in limited time offers and the core business, partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.
Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we have achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment, led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers.
We achieved $113 million of annual cost saves driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth. And there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.
2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements.
At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.
Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift to increase online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead.
We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments increasing 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again recognized as we were ranked as the #1 food brand, with the highest designation of GENIUS, by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. rankings. This is the seventh year in a row we were ranked in the top 5 food and beverage brands.
We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc top 50 company. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year as well as the #1 U.S. company overall and globally #6 overall.
Finally, during the year, we continued to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new ""state of the art"" Northeast distribution center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.
Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plans. 
Starting on Slide 11. In addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms through the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high-growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and foodservice operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors, increases the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration to more value-added and technically insulated products.
We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December, respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans, and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. 
We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extend its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, with our broad presence across all foodservice channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution in its existing foodservice channels as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers, combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends, expands the recipe inspiration and flavor solutions that we offer operators.
Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration, will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. 
With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. We're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods, including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus and fruit flavors. The combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better-for-you and consumer-preferred Flavor Solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. 
Our complementary customer bases of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA's customer-centric culture is very similar to ours. And with the combined power of our organization, we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition.
We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. This confidence is bolstered by a proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy, and both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. We're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, as well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown.
And in Australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption. And we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same in the Americas.
Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. And while there have been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our categories across the globe experienced a sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift in consumer preference, which, coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where through the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. 
Currently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top-selling products. We've now resumed shipping approximately 2/3 of the products, which had been suspended, with the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period, and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both our customers and McCormick, and I'd like to thank our customers for their partnership and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021, and we've implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer term to support continued growth.
Also in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings to consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021. And with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth.
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, bringing real-time insights into actions by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration, for instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and product to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.
New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last 3 years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. 
Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year.
In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various stages of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum with packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic products as well as new products and bigger-bet innovation in 2021. 
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in most markets. In some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants, have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models toward delivery and carryout, the recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences.
Overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun, and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in Flavor Solutions and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships.
Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. With top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
The following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment.
Now Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance."
181176,700101529,2255065,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in con",2128,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.
Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year. Pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.
The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals, continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.
On Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes as well as private-label products due to capacity constraints.
In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago, with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, our Vahiné homemade dessert products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year, as Lawrence mentioned.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases, offset partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasonings. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5%, attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies with strength in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. 
Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. 
As seen on Slide 28. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year ago period as we had planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.
For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. 
The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% in constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by a 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs.
In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense, with a partial offset for CCI-led cost savings.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the full year was comparable to 2019. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. 
For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income, combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.
On Slide 32, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. 
We returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9x. And we expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.
Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we had in progress as well as support our investment to fuel future growth. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.
In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go-lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. 
Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs and, of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations.
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.
Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96, compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. 
We have a strong foundation. We're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We're excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiment and flavors growth platform. We are confident these investments further position us for continued success.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times. 
Now let's turn to your questions."

I guess, first off, I'm curious if those dynamics are in such a place now where we should expect sort of shipments to start to outpace consumption sort of in 1Q and 2Q. Or if you expect still maybe somewhat of a lag effect because you're still building the capacity and the service levels to where you want them to be? 
Because I'm trying to just dimensionalize that sort of first quarter aspect. But more importantly, how to dimensionalize maybe how big of a benefit to 2001 organic growth just a rebuilding of inventory levels to the extent that needs to happen can be to organic growth? And then I just have a quick follow-up."

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter -- and well, really it's through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls. And anybody that walks into a store can see that the shelves are pretty poor conditioned. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes that reflect the fact that we've had our secondary SKUs on suspension to protect the key holiday items. And it's really been those 2 categories that's had the greatest impact. 
Our other product categories has had pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. 
We have -- starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on. As we said in our prepared remarks, about 2/3 of them have been reinstated and the remainder coming in the coming weeks. So I think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. 
We still are allocating product. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries being a bit bare during this time as well. So we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year. And we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of Consumer inventory.
I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. It's just the scale of our Consumer business in the Americas is so great, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. Even in normal circumstances, we have to prebuild inventory to supply the huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. And coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have service issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. 
I will say, just commenting on current conditions, and I don't want to get too much into 2021. We were almost 2/3 of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers, while we're still allocating product, it's the best service that we've had since the spring."

And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior.

I'll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are through the Flavor Solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on a contractual relationship where there's a pass-through of pricing. I don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. 
We are seeing cost inflations. Freight is up. Ocean freight, in particular, is an emerging -- a current and emerging concern. But we're really not prepared to talk about -- make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions.

But on pricing, there are 2 things that are happening in Nielsen that make it look like there's more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there's been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis, where, I'd say, regular -- I'd say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels and tend to carry a higher price point as a result. And that comes through as pricing inflection in the Nielsen data. That is really kind of artificial, and that was one of the things that I was pointing to. 
And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board. That comes through as if it was a price increase in the Nielsen data.
As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch up on trade stock that we will ship to. We have shipped under consumption now for 3 quarters. And I think that you can expect that we will -- as our American supply chain catches up, that we'll -- you'll start to see us shipping above consumption. 
Now consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. Consumer business. And then the market took all of that and that has just -- it still blasted through. 
When we talk about inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock. It's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. And I think that, that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year."

Which is really between the 2 years is quite enough, it really moves the needle. And so we're continuing with those efforts that we think are important. 
This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the category. And so we've taken a look as part of this to -- it reduces the number of items in the store for their section. But we've also looked at the assortment that we offer, and we've SKU rationalized out part of the fairly long tail of products that we have to the tune of about 250 items in the -- purged by seasoning and recipe mix categories to simplify our assortment as well."

Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment.
We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, 2 fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond.
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile times as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift of consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption and eat as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. 
Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. And our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.
This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter and fiscal year results as well as the details of our 2021 guidance.
Turning to Slide 6. Starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line, versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with a partial offset from lower interest expense.
Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance. Starting on Slide 7, in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6% on constant currency, 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.
As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. To protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. And consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.
Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio. In spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. While fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints, this had double-digit growth for the year as did spices and seasonings and the other key categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. The majority of our categories continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.
While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the 5 weeks ending January 17 showed total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again.
In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on holiday proving to be successful. And our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and will continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation.
Now turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, and our Vahiné brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category.
In the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The foodservice industry is continuing to recover but at a gradual pace. Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.
Turning to Slide 8. Our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3%, and all 3 regions contributed to the sales growth. In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products.
Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice, growth of 2%. In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers, where we continue to see momentum in limited time offers and the core business, partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.
Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we have achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment, led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers.
We achieved $113 million of annual cost saves driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth. And there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.
2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements.
At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.
Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift to increase online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead.
We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments increasing 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again recognized as we were ranked as the #1 food brand, with the highest designation of GENIUS, by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. rankings. This is the seventh year in a row we were ranked in the top 5 food and beverage brands.
We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc top 50 company. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year as well as the #1 U.S. company overall and globally #6 overall.
Finally, during the year, we continued to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new ""state of the art"" Northeast distribution center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.
Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plans. 
Starting on Slide 11. In addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms through the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high-growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and foodservice operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors, increases the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration to more value-added and technically insulated products.
We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December, respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans, and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. 
We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extend its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, with our broad presence across all foodservice channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution in its existing foodservice channels as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers, combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends, expands the recipe inspiration and flavor solutions that we offer operators.
Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration, will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. 
With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. We're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods, including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus and fruit flavors. The combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better-for-you and consumer-preferred Flavor Solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. 
Our complementary customer bases of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA's customer-centric culture is very similar to ours. And with the combined power of our organization, we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition.
We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. This confidence is bolstered by a proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy, and both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. We're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, as well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown.
And in Australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption. And we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same in the Americas.
Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. And while there have been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our categories across the globe experienced a sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift in consumer preference, which, coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where through the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. 
Currently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top-selling products. We've now resumed shipping approximately 2/3 of the products, which had been suspended, with the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period, and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both our customers and McCormick, and I'd like to thank our customers for their partnership and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021, and we've implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer term to support continued growth.
Also in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings to consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021. And with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth.
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, bringing real-time insights into actions by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration, for instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and product to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.
New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last 3 years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. 
Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year.
In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various stages of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum with packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic products as well as new products and bigger-bet innovation in 2021. 
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in most markets. In some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants, have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models toward delivery and carryout, the recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences.
Overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun, and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in Flavor Solutions and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships.
Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. With top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
The following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment.
Now Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance."
181176,700101529,2255069,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in con",2128,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.
Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year. Pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.
The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals, continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.
On Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes as well as private-label products due to capacity constraints.
In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago, with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, our Vahiné homemade dessert products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year, as Lawrence mentioned.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases, offset partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasonings. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5%, attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies with strength in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. 
Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. 
As seen on Slide 28. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year ago period as we had planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.
For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. 
The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% in constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by a 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs.
In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense, with a partial offset for CCI-led cost savings.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the full year was comparable to 2019. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. 
For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income, combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.
On Slide 32, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. 
We returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9x. And we expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.
Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we had in progress as well as support our investment to fuel future growth. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.
In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go-lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. 
Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs and, of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations.
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.
Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96, compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

We have a strong foundation. We're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends.

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter -- and well, really it's through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls. And anybody that walks into a store can see that the shelves are pretty poor conditioned. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes that reflect the fact that we've had our secondary SKUs on suspension to protect the key holiday items. And it's really been those 2 categories that's had the greatest impact. 
Our other product categories has had pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. 
We have -- starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on. As we said in our prepared remarks, about 2/3 of them have been reinstated and the remainder coming in the coming weeks. So I think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. 
We still are allocating product. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries being a bit bare during this time as well. So we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year. And we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of Consumer inventory.
I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. It's just the scale of our Consumer business in the Americas is so great, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. Even in normal circumstances, we have to prebuild inventory to supply the huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. And coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have service issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. 
I will say, just commenting on current conditions, and I don't want to get too much into 2021. We were almost 2/3 of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers, while we're still allocating product, it's the best service that we've had since the spring."

So it's not the same as it was a year ago where there was a government lockdown. But the government is encouraging people not to travel, encouraging people to celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Generally in China when the government gives encouragement to do something, they do it. And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior. 
It's not quite as clean as in Australia, where COVID seems to be under control. Restrictions have been lifted, and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home."

I'll remind everybody on the call that 40% of our sales are through the Flavor Solutions segment, and a great portion of that is based on a contractual relationship where there's a pass-through of pricing. I don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. 
We are seeing cost inflations. Freight is up. Ocean freight, in particular, is an emerging -- a current and emerging concern. But we're really not prepared to talk about -- make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions.

But on pricing, there are 2 things that are happening in Nielsen that make it look like there's more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there's been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis, where, I'd say, regular -- I'd say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels and tend to carry a higher price point as a result. And that comes through as pricing inflection in the Nielsen data. That is really kind of artificial, and that was one of the things that I was pointing to. 
And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board. That comes through as if it was a price increase in the Nielsen data.
As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch up on trade stock that we will ship to. We have shipped under consumption now for 3 quarters. And I think that you can expect that we will -- as our American supply chain catches up, that we'll -- you'll start to see us shipping above consumption. 
Now consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. Consumer business. And then the market took all of that and that has just -- it still blasted through. 
When we talk about inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock. It's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. And I think that, that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year."

Although we didn't make as much progress on that last year as we would have hoped when we were talking about it at CAGNY, we were able to impact a little over 5,000 stores last year. So we did continue that effort, even with the pandemic going on. And we would expect to get a like number of stores again in 2021. Which is really between the 2 years is quite enough, it really moves the needle. And so we're continuing with those efforts that we think are important. 
This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the category. And so we've taken a look as part of this to -- it reduces the number of items in the store for their section. But we've also looked at the assortment that we offer, and we've SKU rationalized out part of the fairly long tail of products that we have to the tune of about 250 items in the -- purged by seasoning and recipe mix categories to simplify our assortment as well."

We've talked about kind of there being some unfavorable segment mix. So presumably, we're going to have expectations of the Consumer business being a little below that and Flavor Solutions above that baseline. And the Consumer business does have a tailwind of -- from this restocking benefit as we think about the first half, because you've been undershipping consumption. Now I understand the consumption comps get exceedingly difficult as you get into March, April, May. But I'm just trying to wrap my head around the idea that with some inventory, we're thinking about -- because of the restock, we're thinking about kind of flat to up 2% or so Consumer growth.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Throughout the pandemic, we remain steadfast in our focus on our growth, performance and people strategies, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick to emerge stronger from the crisis. We continue to execute from a position of strength through the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made and the capabilities we've built as an organization. Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on and the effective execution of those strategies, as well as our recent acquisitions of 2 fantastic businesses and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year. 
Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflects our robust growth momentum on a 2-year basis, as seen on Slide 4. We delivered significant double-digit 2-year growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins. Even considering increased COVID-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments. We are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategies actively responding to changing consumer behaviors and capitalizing on new opportunities. 
We are emerging stronger. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. 
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings rates balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment as evidenced again by our second quarter results. 
During last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers cooking and eating more at home, at home consumption resulting in a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our flavor solutions segment. 
Last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the Away from Home products in our portfolio. Our second quarter results reflect the lapping of the year ago comparisons as well as the sustained shift to consumer at home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels and a robust recovery from away-from-home customers. 
Our second quarter results also included strong contributions from our Cholula and Fona acquisition, which further extended the breadth and reach of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident in our balanced portfolio and will continue to differentiate McCormick and sustainably position us for growth. 
Now let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results. Turning to Slide 6. Total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year ago period. In constant currency, sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our Consumer segment, both impacted by the factors I mentioned a few moments ago. The considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income declined 1% or 4% in constant currency. 
At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 in the year ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate. As we stated in our March earnings call, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. 
Importantly, though, we started the first half of the year with outstanding performance. Year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income 16% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, both of which include 3% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share 10%. While Mike will provide more details in a few moments, I'd like to comment on our outlook. 
With our first half results and our robust operating momentum, we are increasing our 2021 outlook for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We are operating in a dynamic cost environment, and we're certainly not unique in experiencing cost pressures. We're seeing broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. To offset rising costs, we are raising prices where appropriate. But usually, there is a lag time associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, most of our actions won't go into effect until late 2021. 
As pricing discussions are ongoing, we can't provide further specifics. We have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings. 
Now let's turn to our second quarter segment business performance, which will include comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic level as we believe these to be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year ago period. 
Starting on Slide 7. with our consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by 2% or in constant currency, 5%.  Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a 2-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product, and importantly, outpaces prepandemic levels. 
Our Americas constant currency sales declined 7% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined 26%. Following a 55% consumption increase in the second quarter of 2020. The difference between year-over-year shipment and consumption changes is attributable to 2 factors. First, we undershipped consumption in the second quarter of last year. Second, we continue to replenish retailer and consumer pantry inventories that were completed throughout last year Demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion. Throughout our first half of the year, we restored products, which had been suspended at the end of last year and continue to see service levels improve, and we're refilling the inventory pipeline. 
As we have said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year through working with our customers on improving shelf conditions we estimate approximately 90% of the suspended products are now back on shelf. We know in the categories most impacted by supply constraints, spices and seasonings and dry recipe mix. There is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. Products that had strong supply and remained on shelf performed well and a suspended products are restocked on shelf, we're seeing improved performance. 
This improvement is somewhat masked due to the lapping of significant overall share gains in the second quarter of last year, Importantly, we continue to anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve. Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our IRI consumption data combined with unmeasured channels, indicates consumption of the portfolio grew 18% versus the second quarter of 2019, led by significant growth in spices and seasonings and hot sauces, and also includes triple-digit pure-play growth in e-commerce, with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the third consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits in the mid- to high teens versus the 2 year ago period, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our categories. 
Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well. Household penetration and repeat buy rates have also grown versus 2019, and when our consumers shop they were buying more of our products than they were prepandemic. And finally, for the Americas, our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings consumers with new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration is yielding great early results were implemented, the category and McCormick branded growth is outpacing the rest of market, and we plan to implement this in thousands of additional stores in the third quarter. 
Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the second quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share in our core brands and markets following the strong gains in the second quarter last year. Notably, both Schwartz and Ducros spices and seasoning as well as Frank's RedHot grew consumption during the second quarter against a strong comparison to double-digit growth last year. And not only are we retaining new households we gained last year, but we are also continuing to increase household penetration for the fifth consecutive quarter. 
Our investments in brand marketing in EMEA which significantly increased in the second quarter compared to last year are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed as well as our achieving above benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click through, for instance, in our digital marketing. 
Additionally, the creativity of [indiscernible] campaign received national media attention in France as well as a prestigious award for its excellence in advertising and design. On a 2-year basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019, we drove double-digit consumption growth and market share gains in our core categories and markets, including total EMEA region spices and seasoning, [indiscernible] Homemade desserts in France and both Schwartz recipe mixes and Frank's RedHot in the U.K. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region. 
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter sales growth was strong. During this time last year, China's Hubei province, where our Wuhan operations are located, remains in lockdown in part of the second quarter, and our results reflect the recovery from that as well as the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China. China's food service is almost fully returned to prepandemic levels with restaurant home delivery increasing of popularity. Our consumer product demand declined due to lapping significant growth last year. 
In Australia, we continue to see elevated consumption and share gains versus the second quarter of 2019 with Frank's RedHot and subs consumption growing triple digits and gaining share. the Gourmet Garden, McCormick and Teens spice and seasonings outpacing the category with double-digit consumption growth. Across all our regions, our new products continue to be integral to our growth, and we're gaining significant momentum for the recent launches. For instance, our Grill Mates all purpose seasoning and our Frank's frozen appetizers are driving growth in the Americas as consumers have shifted their thinking about convenience from no cooking to cooking easily. And in EMEA, the rollout of our First Choice glass bottle into the Eastern European market is going very well, increasing our relevance with consumers and driving share gains as they perceive the glass bottle as a premium to sachets. 
Moving forward, but we know we will be lapping challenging year-over-year consumption comparisons in the second half of the year, we are confident that we continue to capture the momentum in our consumer segment, we have more consumers than pre-pandemic that come into our brands for having a good experience and are buying our products again. We are excited about our growth trajectory and expect continued and long-lasting growth from the sustained shift consumers cooking more at health, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives as well as growth from our Cholula acquisition. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our Flavor Solutions second quarter results include not only recovering from significant curtailment of away-from-home dining during last year's second quarter, but also the growth momentum we are gaining with our restaurant and other foodservice customers as well as the continued strong momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. 
In the second quarter, our sales rose 39% or 34% at constant currency, with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. And on a 2-year basis, our sales also increased double digits in all 3 regions. In the Americas, our Fona and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant growth in the second quarter, and we are executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. We continue to see strong growth in our consumer packaged food customers while executing on our portfolio migration through new products and base business strength. Compared to last year's second quarter, snack seasonings grew double digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. Consumers rising global demand for hot spicy flavors is driving growth for our customer snacks and for our seasonings that flavor net. And with the flavored hard seltzer trend accelerating, we are winning new business and growing our flavor sales for beverages considerably, up triple digits in the second quarter. Demand from our Americas Away-From-Home customer base, for branded foodservice and restaurant customers increased significantly due to the recovery I mentioned a few moments ago. Our away-from-home rebound in this region is at a slower pace as our customer base is more skewed to branded foodservice. 
We anticipate our demand from this channel will strengthen as the year progresses and more dining options reopen. In EMEA, as we cycled a significant decline in last year's second quarter from region-wide shutdowns, our growth was substantial. Our sales to quick service restaurants, or QSRs, more than doubled from the second quarter of last year and increased double digits from the same period in 2019, with particular strength in the U.K. Turning to our consumer packaged food and beverage customers. We had strong second quarter performance on top of last year's strong growth with growth in flavors for sweet beverages and the hot and spicy trend fueling both base and new product growth in snack seasonings. 
Our sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was partially due to the recovery from lockdowns, closures and curfews in countries outside of China during the second quarter of last year. as well as continued momentum in Australia from QSR customers, limited time offer. Additionally, China where QSRs were opened in the second quarter of last year, delivered double-digit growth due to significant momentum and limited time offers as well as strength in the core business. Across all regions, we recognize a large part of our second quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to abnormally low away-from-home demand last year. 
Importantly, though, our growth also includes contributions for Fona and Cholula, strong growth with packaged food and beverage customers, both in the base business and the new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum of QSRs, partially from their limited time offers and promotional activity. While we know a portion of our second half growth will still be impacted by recovery, our second quarter results and our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence in returning to our robust pre-pandemic growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
Now for a brief update on how we're driving growth with Cholula and Fona, starting with Cholula on Slide 9. In our consumer segment, Cholula continues to outpace category growth and gained share growing consumption of 54% since the second quarter of 2019. We're using our category management expertise to expand distribution points, including with the 2-ounce bottle size and expansion into new channels, optimize shelf assortment and placement and gained momentum in e-commerce where Cholula has been underpenetrated. We are increasing awareness through brand partnerships such as with HelloFresh and DoorDash as well as through brand marketing investments and by leveraging promotional scale across McCormick brand, including Cholula's best-ever Cinco de Mayo promotion with double the merchandising in 2019 and scale with McCormick's taco seasoning. 
Our initiatives are yielding results. We have grown total distribution points 11% and household penetration 5% since the second quarter of 2020. We recently launched Cholula wing sauces and also relaunched the green pepper -- flavors with cleaner formulas. And in our flavor solutions segment, we're using our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, to grow our back-of-house food service penetration by increasing Cholula's menu participation. 
Since the beginning of the year, we've driven a 63% increase in U.S. national chain restaurant locations activating a Cholula branded limited time offer. We are winning in food service. 
Now moving to Fona. We're excited by year-to-date double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category continued to drive significant growth for Fona, 14% on a year-to-date basis. We're driving growth with our global footprint. For example, by leveraging -- infrastructure, we're expanding flavors for our top phone customer into the EMEA region, but the first order being manufactured this month. We're also leveraging McCormick's sustainability leadership to create new opportunities with Fona customers. Combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to bid on customer briefs to capitalize on core strengths across McCormick and Fona, including McCormick's culinary focus and Fona speed to market. 
Fona's year-to-date new product wins and its pipeline potential has hit record highs fueling future growth. We have also identified longer-term opportunities to optimize our combined assets and technologies across the network to expand our capacity and drive further solutions for our customers. Customer reaction has been extremely positive. They are repressed for their early collaboration and excitement about our increased customer value proposition continues to build. Our enthusiasm for Cholula and Fona and our confidence we will deliver on our acquisition plans, accelerate growth with these portfolios and drive shareholder value continue to strengthen. In fact, we're now projecting the incremental sales contribution of these acquisitions to be at the high end of our 3.5% to 4% guidance range. 
Now I'd like to share some of our insights on long-term consumer trends. As seen on Slides 11 and 12. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. We are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as they have been in the past with the younger generations continuing to fuel the demand for flavor at a greater rate. As we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research tells us that consumers are enjoying the cooking experience. It provides a creative outlet, makes them feel adventurous, reduces stress and connects the family, and they feel home cooked meals are healthier. In a recent consumer survey from May n68% of U.S. consumer survey state they are cooking more today than prepandemic, and 78% claim, they would maintain or increase their level of cooking at home as things return to normal next week. With no meaningful difference between those vaccinated and those not. 
Research indicates a continued increased level of cooking in other countries as well. Consumers have formed new habits. They invested in new kitchen appliances and want to try new things. They want to cook versus have to cook, but the majority of food from restaurants being consumed at home and over 70% of U.S. consumers are adding their own spices, seasonings and economists to further flavor their takeaway or deliver food, channels have become worth. And lunch is the new meal to prepare at home. With hybrid workplace models, more common post pandemic, allowing employees to split time between the office and home. Research indicates at-home lunch occasions increasing up to 30%. 
We believe consumer behavior and sentiment driving accelerated and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic and combined with the effective execution of our growth strategies will further drive consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 13. We are making transformative investments, which will enable us to sustainably meet increasing demand both for our product and our customers' product. We're investing in our supply chain to expand our capacity and capabilities as well as increase our resiliency. For example, we are increasing our condiment and seasoning capacity. We plan to optimize our distribution network for their new Northeast U.S. distribution center, our largest in the world, and we are in the final stages of building a new U.K. flavor solutions manufacturing facility, which is on track to become comes first net 0 carbon building. These investments will enable us to remain agile and scalable and deliver the future growth that we expect. 
Now for some summary comments. First, I am pleased to share an important milestone for McCormick. With our overarching focus on growth and the successful execution of our strategy, we have consistently driven industry-leading revenue growth, resulting in McCormick being made the latest Fortune 500 list of companies by Fortune Magazine. We are proud of our sustained performance and being included on this prestigious list. We take pride in delivering our industry-leading financial performance while doing the right thing with responsibility to the long-term vitality of people, communities and the planet we share. In May, we were named a Diversity Inc. top 50 company for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally as well as our broader ESG efforts. 
In summary, our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook continue to be stronger than ever. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, the breadth and reach of our portfolio and a robust operating momentum combined with the successful execution of our strategy, bolsters our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments. 
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we are sustainably positioned for growth. I would like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their dedicated efforts and engagement. They've done a tremendous job navigating this past year's volatile environment and ensuring that we emerge stronger with their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor and winning they drive our momentum and success. 
Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?"

For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. Our second quarter performance was very strong. Starting with our top line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and Fona acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with flavor solutions growth offsetting a decline in the consumer segment, versus the second quarter of 2019, we grew sales 18% in constant currency. During the second quarter, our consumer segment lapped exceptionally high demand for our products driven by the surge in consumers cooking more at home at the onset of the pandemic. As such, versus last year, our second quarter Consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency. 
On Slide 18, consumer segment sales in the Americas lapping the demand surge in the year-ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of Cholula. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency, with significant broad-based growth across the McCormick branded portfolio. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago. Also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. 
Notably, this decline includes growth in our U.K. and Eastern European markets on top of their significant growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region. 
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in Wuhan last year, with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery. 
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 21. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our Fona and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher sales of away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency. 
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with Fona and Cholula contributing 13%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers as well as growth to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings and beverages. 
On a 2-year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business. In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. 
Constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and QSR customers. In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year, led by growth with QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to new products and our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns in countries outside of China in the year ago period. 
Sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019. As seen on Slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and Fona acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency, 4% in the second quarter versus the year ago period. Adjusted operating income in the consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency, 26%, driven by -- primarily by lower sales. 
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales. Both segments were favorably impacted by product mix and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from cost inflation, including transportation costs. COVID-19-related costs were comparable to the year-ago period. Additionally, in the consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% from the second quarter of last year. 
As seen on Slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points, with the increase in brand marketing, partially offset by leverage from sales growth. Adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margin declined by 200 basis points. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both margins. 
Importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points, even considering incremental COVID-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments. 
Turning to income taxes. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact last year due to discrete tax item related to the refinement of our entity structure. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of March, we completed the sale of our minority stake in Eastern Condiments, one of our joint ventures in India. 
For 2021, we now expect a low single-digit decline in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, partially due to the elimination of ongoing income from [indiscernible]. Previously, we were projecting a low single-digit increase. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 29, quarter 2020 earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by a higher adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share. 
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021. Compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020. This change primarily resulted from a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. We returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 31 and 32. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. 
At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously. This includes the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions projected to be at the high end of the 3.5% to 4% range. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and our customer engagement growth plans. 
Pricing taken to partially offset cost inflation is also expected to contribute to sales growth. We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020. Our previous projection was comparable to 2020. We are increasing our inflation expectation for the year to a mid-single-digit increase as compared to a low single-digit increase previously. 
Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, COVID-19 costs and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing as well as margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. 
Reflecting the changes in our sales and gross profit margin outlooks, we are increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth. Partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency. This projection includes the inflationary pressure, I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. 
It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments. We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. We are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, as I mentioned earlier. 
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax segment. 
I'll now turn it back to Lawrence."

We're certainly seeing that all over the world, our research and survey data with consumers that we commented on just a few minutes ago, all points in that direction and the behavior seems to be bearing it out, of course, in this quarter in many developed markets where we're lapping extraordinary consumption when lockdowns were heavily in place for the first time. But even in each this time. If you look at the stack 2 year, you see consumption is still up very dramatically versus then. 
And just all indications are that, that's going to be the case. -- we are seeing foodservice recover. And it is a bit of a paradox that consumer consumption at home seems to be remaining high and food services is recovering. We don't believe that people are eating more, but we do believe that they're cooking more, and that benefits our more ingredient-based flavor products."

We're shipping to consumption and have been in the rest of the world. Our Flavor Solutions isn't impacted by that on the Americas consumer. We weren't able to keep up with the sustained demand and so trade inventories. And frankly, consumer pantries have been depleted. And so there has been a need to do rebuild you all saw on the shelf that, especially as we came through the end of last year, the shelf look pretty rough. A number of you on the call, and Ken, I think maybe you also have written about TDPs and so on. But we're about 90% of the way to restoring the shelf, we really see we ended suspensions. We still have a few products on allocation and demand has continued to be really strong. So we're in some cases, very much and do -- on some products -- is a product that we have -- that requires a lot of blending capacity. And so we're a bit hand to mouth on that one, believe it or not. But -- But in terms of restocking the shelf, honestly, I wish we had done a little bit more in second quarter. I said we're at 90%. We would have really hoped to have it all done and there is still more work to do because the demand has just continued to remain high through this period. If you just do the math, -- there's a lot of noise in the year ago numbers. So if you take it back then a year ago, consumption was up tremendously, but we couldn't ship to that. Our shipments flagged a lot. So if we compare back to 2019, our consumption is up in second quarter, 18% versus 2019. Our organic sales, stripping out acquisitions are up 22%. That would suggest there's about a 4% inventory rebuilding impact in the second quarter on our Americas consumer business. So it was a factor. It's not as big as I think a lot of people have it in their mind."

There is always an amount of commercial tension in our pricing discussions, but we're really confident that we're going to be able to get through the pricing that we need. We take a long-term perspective with our customers. They know that we are fair that we are transparent in our cost. There is broad-based inflation that's recognized by everybody. It's not just us that's going up in isolation that's full industry is moving. And so we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to take the pricing that we need. We're going to use all of the levers that we have to address costs. So pricing certainly has to be part of the solution. But cost savings and revenue management are going to factor in the dealing with the inflation issue. And I think we have pretty strong confidence that these discussions are going to be positive. 
I think too, we're continuing to invest in our brands. We're -- most of the share of voice in the category, which our customers know that. And you saw year-to-date we're up nicely in A&P. And again into the third quarter, so that is supporting their business, too."

In the year ago period, we had heavy supply heavy through second quarter, we were in a great stock position. We were building inventory for an ERP pilot. And so we had unusually high stock levels of finished goods ourselves going when the crisis hit, which enabled us to have extraordinary supply in the early weeks of the pandemic. 
I will say, by the end of second quarter, it was a very different situation, but going into the quarter, it was strong. And so our -- our shelf position was really advantaged. And then, of course, we went through a long period where we weren't able to meet the demand and our shelf position deteriorated. We had to suspend items put them on allocation, stop promotion and so on. And our total distribution points declined as a result. And -- and so we're comparing against a period of unusual strength at retail and in the year ago period and in this period, we've got a time when we're rebuilding that shelf position pretty much everywhere where we we've been able to have good supply and good service to our customers. 
Our share has grown, not declined. That's the case across our markets in Europe.

I mean there's been a lot of talk about changes in consumer behavior, but really is an amplification of trends that were already in place that we believe our long-term secular trends that underlie our growth and that our strategies are designed to capitalize on and the global demand for flavor has been growing steadily for I don't even know how long. It's a tremendous amount -- projects global flavor demand to grow the 6% rate going forward for the next 5 years. 
And that is really the foundation for our sales growth. And then if you just think about compared to 2019, underlying global demand for flavor growing in the absence of a pandemic, 6% CAGR, you would expect us to be up 12%. So I think that the performance that you're seeing is really more of a bleed through of what you're going to see in a post-pandemic world, consumers for cooking at home more before the pandemic. We believe that, that was accelerated that people -- a lot of lapsed cooks had the opportunity to cook. Everyone learned their Grandma and mother's secret recipes and then how to prepare them, someone in every household has become a very proficient. And it's been a positive experience for people. They have an outlet for creativity. It's brought families together, and we think that this is a behavior that is going to be sticky. Younger consumers, in particular, have leaning towards healthy, flavorful, more scratch cooking and in particular, among Gen Z, a return to trusted brands and brands with some nostalgia, we think that these are really long-term demographic trends that are going to benefit us for a long time.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth, performance and people strategies, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick",3806,"Thank you, Kasey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth, performance and people strategies, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick to emerge stronger from the crisis.
We continued to execute from a position of strength through the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made and the capabilities we've built as an organization. Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on and the effective execution of those strategies, as well as our recent acquisitions of 2 fantastic businesses and, importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lapped very strong growth last year.
Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflects our robust growth momentum on a 2-year basis, as seen on Slide 4. We delivered significant double-digit 2-year growth rate for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins, even considering increased COVID-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments. We are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategies, actively responding to changing consumer behaviors and capitalizing on new opportunities. We are emerging stronger.
As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment as evidenced again by our second quarter results.
During last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers cooking and eating more at home, at-home consumption, resulting in a substantial increase in our consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. Last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio. Our second quarter results reflect the lapping of these year-ago comparisons as well as the sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels and a robust recovery from away-from-home customers.
Our second quarter results also include strong contributions from our Cholula and FONA acquisition, which further extended the breadth and reach of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers. Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident in our balanced portfolio and will continue to differentiate McCormick and sustainably position us for growth.
Now let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results. Turning to Slide 6. Total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year-ago period. In constant currency, sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our Consumer segment, both impacted by the factors I mentioned a few moments ago. The considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income decline of 1% or 4% in constant currency.
At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 in the year-ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate. As we stated in our March earnings call, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. Importantly, though, we started the first half of the year with outstanding performance. Year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income 16% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, both of which include 3% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share 10%.
While Mike will provide more details in a few moments, I'd like to comment on our outlook. With our first half results and our robust operating momentum, we are increasing our 2021 outlook for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. We are operating in a dynamic cost environment, and we're certainly not unique in experiencing cost pressures. We're seeing broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs.
To offset rising costs, we are raising prices where appropriate. But usually, there is a lag time associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, most of our actions won't go into effect until late 2021. As pricing discussions are ongoing, we can't provide further specifics. We have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings.
Now let's turn to our second quarter segment business performance, which will include comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic level as we believe these to be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year-ago period. Starting on Slide 7. With our Consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by 2% or in constant currency, 5%. Our Consumer segment's organic sales momentum on a 2-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product, and importantly, outpaces pre-pandemic levels.
Our Americas constant currency sales declined 7% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined 26%, following a 55% consumption increase in the second quarter of 2020.
The difference between year-over-year shipment and consumption changes is attributable to 2 factors. First, we undershipped consumption in the second quarter of last year. Second, we continued to replenish retailer and consumer pantry inventories that were completed throughout last year. Demand has remained high, and we continued to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion.
Throughout our first half of the year, we restored products, which had been suspended at the end of last year and continued to see service levels improve, and we're refilling the inventory pipeline. As we have said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. Through working with our customers on improving shelf conditions, we estimate approximately 90% of the suspended products are now back on shelf.
We know in the categories most impacted by supply constraints, spices and seasonings and dry recipe mix, there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. Products that had strong supply and remained on shelf performed well and as suspended products are restocked on shelf, we're seeing improved performance. This improvement is somewhat masked due to the lapping of significant overall share gains in the second quarter of last year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve.
Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our IRI consumption data, combined with unmeasured channels, indicates consumption of the portfolio grew 18% versus the second quarter of 2019, led by significant growth in spices and seasonings and hot sauces, and also includes triple-digit pure-play growth in e-commerce, with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the third consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits in the mid- to high teens versus the 2 year-ago period, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our categories. Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well.
Household penetration and repeat buy rates have also grown versus 2019. And when our consumers shop, they were buying more of our products than they were prepandemic. And finally, for the Americas, our initiative to reinvent the in-store experiences for spices and seasonings consumers with new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration is yielding great early results. Where implemented, the category and McCormick branded growth is outpacing the rest of market, and we plan to implement this in thousands of additional stores in the third quarter.
Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the second quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share in our core brands and markets following the strong gains in the second quarter last year. Notably, both Schwartz and Ducros spices and seasonings as well as Frank's RedHot grew consumption during the second quarter against a strong comparison to double-digit growth last year. And not only are we retaining new households we gained last year, but we are also continuing to increase household penetration for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Our investments in brand marketing in EMEA which significantly increased in the second quarter compared to last year are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed as well as our achieving above benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click through, for instance, in our digital marketing. Additionally, the creativity of our Vahiné Happy Birthday campaign received national media attention in France as well as a prestigious award for its excellence in advertising and design.
On a 2-year basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019, we drove double-digit consumption growth and market share gains in our core categories and markets, including total EMEA region spices and seasoning, Vahiné homemade desserts in France and both Schwartz recipe mixes and Frank's RedHot in the U.K. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region.
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter sales growth was strong. During this time last year, China's Hubei province, where our Wuhan operations are located, remained in lockdown in part of the second quarter, and our results reflect the recovery from that as well as the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China. China's foodservice is almost fully returned to prepandemic levels with restaurant home delivery increasing of popularity. Our consumer product demand declined due to lapping significant growth last year.
In Australia, we continued to see elevated consumption and share gains versus the second quarter of 2019 with Frank's RedHot and subs consumption growing triple digits and gaining share. The Gourmet Garden, McCormick and Keene’s spice and seasonings outpacing the category with double-digit consumption growth.
Across all our regions, our new products continue to be integral to our growth, and we're gaining significant momentum for the recent launches. For instance, our Grill Mates all purpose seasoning and our Frank's frozen appetizers are driving growth in the Americas as consumers have shifted their thinking about convenience from no cooking to cooking easily. And in EMEA, the rollout of our first choice glass bottle into the Eastern European market is going very well, increasing our relevance with consumers and driving share gains as they perceive the glass bottle as a premium to sachets.
Moving forward, while we know we will be lapping challenging year-over-year consumption comparisons, in the second half of the year, we are confident that we continue to capture the momentum in our consumer segment. We have more consumers than pre-pandemic that have come into our brands, are having a good experience and are buying our products again. We are excited about our growth trajectory and expect continued and long-lasting growth from the sustained shift in consumers cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives as well as growth from our Cholula acquisition.
Turning to Slide 8. Our Flavor Solutions second quarter results include not only recovering from the significant curtailment of away-from-home dining during last year's second quarter, but also the growth momentum we are gaining with our restaurant and other foodservice customers as well as the continued strong momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. In the second quarter, our sales rose 39% or 34% at constant currency, with double-digit growth in all 3 regions. And on a 2-year basis, our sales also increased double digits in all 3 regions.
In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant growth in the second quarter, and we are executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. We continue to see strong growth in our consumer packaged food customers while executing on our portfolio migration through new products and base business strength. Compared to last year's second quarter, snack seasonings grew double digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust.
Consumers rising global demand for hot spicy flavors is driving growth for our customer snacks and for our seasonings that flavor them. And with the flavored hard seltzer trend accelerating, we are winning new business and growing our flavor sales for beverages considerably, up triple digits in the second quarter. Demand from our Americas away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers increased significantly due to the recovery I mentioned a few moments ago. Our away-from-home rebound in this region is at a slower pace as our customer base is more skewed to branded foodservice. We anticipate our demand from this channel will strengthen as the year progresses and more dining options reopen.
In EMEA, as we cycled a significant decline in last year's second quarter from region-wide shutdowns, our growth was substantial. Our sales to quick service restaurants, or QSRs, more than doubled from the second quarter of last year and increased double digits from the same period in 2019, with particular strength in the U.K. Turning to our consumer packaged food and beverage customers. We had strong second quarter performance on top of last year's strong growth with growth in flavors for sweet beverages and the hot and spicy trend fueling both base and new product growth in snack seasonings.
Our sales growth in the Asia Pacific region was partially due to the recovery from lockdowns, closures and curfews in countries outside of China during the second quarter of last year as well as continued momentum in Australia from QSR customers' limited time offer. Additionally, China, where QSRs were opened in the second quarter of last year, delivered double-digit growth due to significant momentum and limited time offers as well as strength in the core business.
Across all regions, we recognized a large part of our second quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to abnormally low away-from-home demand last year. Importantly, though, our growth also includes contributions from FONA and Cholula, strong growth with packaged food and beverage customers, both in the base business and the new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum of QSRs, partially from their limited time offers and promotional activity. While we know a portion of our second half growth will still be impacted by recovery, our second quarter results and our effective growth strategies bolster our confidence in returning to our robust pre-pandemic growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment.
Now for a brief update on how we're driving growth with Cholula and FONA, starting with Cholula on Slide 9. In our Consumer segment, Cholula continues to outpace category growth and gained share, growing consumption of 54% since the second quarter of 2019. We're using our category management expertise to expand distribution points, including with the 2-ounce bottle size and expansion into new channels, optimize shelf assortment and placement and gain momentum in e-commerce where Cholula has been underpenetrated. We are increasing awareness through brand partnerships such as with HelloFresh and DoorDash as well as through brand marketing investments and by leveraging promotional scale across McCormick brand, including Cholula's best-ever Cinco de Mayo promotion with double the merchandising in 2019 and scale with McCormick's taco seasoning.
Our initiatives are yielding results. We have grown total distribution points 11% and household penetration 5% since the second quarter of 2020. We recently launched Cholula wing sauces and also relaunched the green pepper and chipotle flavors with cleaner formulas. And in our Flavor Solutions segment, we're using our culinary foundation and insights on menu trends, to grow our back-of-house foodservice penetration by increasing Cholula's menu participation. Since the beginning of the year, we've driven a 63% increase in U.S. national chain restaurant locations activating a Cholula branded limited time offer. We are winning in foodservice.
Now moving to FONA. We're excited by year-to-date double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category continued to drive significant growth for FONA, 14% on a year-to-date basis. We're driving growth with our global footprint. For example, by leveraging Giotti's infrastructure, we're expanding flavors for our top FONA customer into the EMEA region, with the first order being manufactured this month.
We're also leveraging McCormick's sustainability leadership to create new opportunities with FONA customers. Combination of our capabilities has created new opportunities to bid on customer briefs to capitalize on core strengths across McCormick and FONA, including McCormick's culinary focus and FONA's speed to market.
FONA'S year-to-date new product wins and its pipeline potential has hit record highs fueling future growth. We've also identified longer term opportunities to optimize our combined assets and technologies across the network to expand our capacity and drive further solutions for our customers. Customer reaction has been extremely positive. They are impressed for their early collaboration and excitement about our increased customer value proposition continues to build.
Our enthusiasm for Cholula and FONA and our confidence we will deliver on our acquisition plans, accelerate growth with these portfolios and drive shareholder value continue to strengthen. In fact, we're now projecting the incremental sales contribution of these acquisitions to be at the high end of our 3.5% to 4% guidance range.
Now I'd like to share some of our insights on long-term consumer trends, as seen on Slides 11 and 12. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth. We are capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends and the rising global demand for great taste are as relevant today as they have been in the past with the younger generations continuing to fuel the demand for flavor at a greater rate.
As we've shared previously, our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research tells us that consumers are enjoying the cooking experience. It provides a creative outlet, makes them feel adventurous, reduces stress and connects the family, and they feel home cooked meals are healthier. In a recent consumer survey from May, 68% of U.S. consumers surveyed state they are cooking more today than prepandemic, and 78% claim they would maintain or increase their level of cooking at home, things return to normal next week with no meaningful difference between those vaccinated and those not.  
Research indicates a continued increased level of cooking in other countries as well. Consumers have formed new habits. They invested in new kitchen appliances and want to try new things. They want to cook versus have to cook, but the majority of food from restaurants being consumed at home and over 70% of U.S. consumers are adding their own spices, seasonings and condiments to further flavor their takeaway or deliver food, channels have become [ blurb ]. And lunch is the new meal to prepare at home. 
With hybrid workplace models more common post pandemic, allowing employees to split time between the office and home, research indicates at-home lunch occasions increasing up to 30%. We believe consumer behavior and sentiment driving accelerated and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and persist beyond the pandemic and, combined with the effective execution of our growth strategies, will further drive consumer demand for our products in 2021 and beyond.
Moving to Slide 13. We are making transformative investments, which will enable us to sustainably meet increasing demand both for our products and our customers' product. We're investing in our supply chain to expand our capacity and capabilities as well as increase our resiliency. For example, we are increasing our condiment and seasoning capacity. We plan to optimize our distribution network with our new Northeast U.S. distribution center, our largest in the world, and we are in the final stages of building a new U.K. Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility, which is on track to become McCormick's first net-zero carbon building. These investments will enable us to remain agile and scalable and deliver the future growth that we expect.
Now for some summary comments. First, I am pleased to share an important milestone for McCormick. With our overarching focus on growth and the successful execution of our strategy, we have consistently driven industry-leading revenue growth, resulting in McCormick being made the latest Fortune 500 list of companies by Fortune Magazine. We are proud of our sustained performance and being included on this prestigious list.
We take pride in delivering our industry-leading financial performance while doing the right thing with responsibility to the long-term vitality of people, communities and the planet we share. In May, we were named a DiversityInc top 50 company for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition is a testament to our emphasis on embracing and leveraging diversity and inclusion globally as well as our broader ESG efforts.
In summary, our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook continue to be stronger than ever. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, the breadth and reach of our portfolio and a robust operating momentum, combined with the successful execution of our strategy, bolsters our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021. Following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth, even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments.
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we are sustainably positioned for growth. I would like to recognize and thank McCormick employees around the world for their dedicated efforts and engagement. They've done a tremendous job navigating this past year's volatile environment and ensuring that we emerge stronger. With their agility, teamwork and passion for flavor and winning, they drive our momentum and success.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?"

For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. Our second quarter performance was very strong. Starting with our top line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant c",1830,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. For the reasons Lawrence mentioned, my comments will also include comparisons to 2019. Our second quarter performance was very strong. Starting with our top line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with Flavor Solutions growth offsetting a decline in the Consumer segment. Versus the second quarter of 2019, we grew sales 18% in constant currency.
During the second quarter, our Consumer segment lapped exceptionally high demand for our products, driven by the surge in consumers cooking more at home at the onset of the pandemic. As such, versus last year, our second quarter Consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency.
On Slide 18, Consumer segment sales in the Americas lapping the demand surge in the year-ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of Cholula. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency, with significant broad-based growth across the McCormick branded portfolio. In the EMEA, constant currency consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago. Also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year.
Notably, this decline includes growth in our U.K. and Eastern European markets on top of their significant growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region.
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in Wuhan last year, with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year-ago period. Sales were comparable to the second quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 21. We grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a higher sales of away-from-home products in our portfolio across all regions. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency.
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with FONA and Cholula contributing 13%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales to branded foodservice customers as well as growth to packaged food and beverage companies with particular strength in snack seasonings and beverages. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business.
In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and QSR customers.
In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year, led by growth with QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to new products and our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns in countries outside of China in the year-ago period. Sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019.
As seen on Slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency, 4%, in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency, 26%, driven by -- primarily by lower sales.
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales. Both segments were favorably impacted by product mix and CCI-led cost savings with a partial offset from cost inflation, including transportation costs. COVID-19 related costs were comparable to the year-ago period. Additionally, in the Consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% from the second quarter of last year.
As seen on Slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points, with the increase in brand marketing, partially offset by leverage from sales growth. Adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margin declined by 200 basis points. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, the sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both margins. Importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points, even considering incremental COVID-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments.
Turning to income taxes. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items, with a more significant impact last year due to discrete tax item related to the refinement of our entity structure. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021. At the end of March, we completed the sale of our minority stake in Eastern Condiments, one of our joint ventures in India.
For 2021, we now expect a low single-digit decline in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, partially due to the elimination of ongoing income from Eastern. Previously, we were projecting a low single-digit increase. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 29, second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year-ago period. The decline was primarily driven by a higher adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
On Slide 30, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021, compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020. This change primarily resulted from a lower level of cash generated from working capital associated with increased sales, higher incentive compensation payments and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions.
We returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter. We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 31 and 32. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.
We expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously. And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates.
At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously. This includes the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions projected to be at the high end of the 3.5%, 4% range. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and our customer engagement growth plans. Pricing taken to partially offset cost inflation is also expected to contribute to sales growth.
We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020. Our previous projection was comparable to 2020. We are increasing our inflation expectation for the year to a mid-single-digit increase as compared to a low single-digit increase previously. Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impacts from sales mix between segments, COVID-19 costs and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing as well as margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions.
As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year.
Reflecting the changes in our sales and gross profit margin outlooks, we are increasing our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment.
This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency. This projection includes the inflationary pressure I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments.
We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%.
We are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, as I mentioned earlier.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020. This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax segment.
I'll now turn it back to Lawrence."

Our research and survey data with consumers that we commented on just a few minutes ago, all points in that direction and the behavior seems to be bearing it out, of course, in this quarter in many developed markets where we're lapping extraordinary consumption when lockdowns were heavily in place for the first time. But even in this time, if you look at the stack 2 year, you see consumption is still up very dramatically versus then.
And just all indications are that, that's going to be the case. We are seeing foodservice recover.

We don't believe that people are eating more, but we do believe that they're cooking more, and that benefits our more ingredient-based flavor products."

We're shipping to consumption and have been in the rest of the world. Our Flavor Solutions isn't impacted by that on the Americas consumer. We weren't able to keep up with the sustained demand and so we have trade inventories. And frankly, consumer pantries have been depleted. And so there has been a need to do a rebuild. You all saw on the shelf that, especially as we came through the end of last year, the shelf looked pretty rough. A number of you on the call, and Ken, I think maybe you also have written about TDPs and so on.
But we're about 90% of the way to restoring the shelf. We really -- we ended suspensions. We still have a few products on allocation and demand has continued to be really strong. So we're, in some cases, very much hand to mouth on some products. OLD BAY is a product that we have -- that requires a lot of blending capacity. And so we're a bit hand to mouth on that one, believe it or not.
But in terms of restocking the shelf, honestly, I wish we had done a little bit more in second quarter. I said we're at 90%. We would have really hoped to have it all done and there is still more work to do because the demand has just continued to remain high through this period. If you just do the math, -- there's a lot of noise in the year-ago numbers. So if you take it back then a year ago, consumption was up tremendously, but we couldn't ship to that. Our shipments flagged it a lot.
So if we compare back to 2019, our consumption is up in second quarter, 18%, versus 2019. Our organic sales, stripping out acquisitions, are up 22%. That would suggest there's about a 4% inventory rebuilding impact in the second quarter on our Americas consumer business. So it was a factor. It's not as big as I think a lot of people have it in their mind."

COVID cost obviously hit us in the second quarter, although we were comparable to last year overall, but there was some segment mix there.
We do feel too within the Flavor Solutions category though, we -- one with FONA, that's a nice margin bump.

In the year-ago period, we had heavy supply -- heavy -- through second quarter, we were in a great stock position. We were building inventory for an ERP pilot. And so we had unusually high stock levels of finished goods ourselves going when the crisis hit, which enabled us to have extraordinary supply in the early weeks of the pandemic.
I will say, by the end of second quarter, it was a very different situation, but going into the quarter, it was strong. And so our shelf position was really advantaged. And then, of course, we went through a long period where we weren't able to meet the demand and our shelf position deteriorated. We had to suspend items, put them on allocation, stop promotion and so on.
And our total distribution points declined as a result. And so we're comparing against a period of unusual strength at retail and in the year-ago period and in this period, we've got a time when we're rebuilding that shelf position pretty much everywhere where we've been able to have good supply and good service to our customers.
Our share has grown, not declined. That's the case across our markets in Europe.

I mean there's been a lot of talk about changes in consumer behavior, but really is an amplification of trends that were already in place that we believe our long-term secular trends that underlie our growth and that our strategies are designed to capitalize on. I mean the global demand for flavor has been growing steadily for I don't even know how long. It's a tremendous amount. Euromonitor projects global flavor demand to grow at a 6% rate going forward for the next 5 years. And that is really the foundation for our sales growth.

So I think that the performance that you're seeing is really more of a bleed through of what you're going to see in a post-pandemic world, consumers for cooking at home more before the pandemic. We believe that, that was accelerated, that people -- a lot of lapsed cooks had the opportunity to cook.
Everyone learned their grandma and their mother's secret recipes and then how to prepare them. Someone in every household has become a very proficient cook. And it's been a positive experience for people. They have an outlet for creativity. It's brought families together, and we think that this is a behavior that is going to be sticky.
Younger consumers, in particular, have leaned towards healthy, flavorful, more scratch cooking and, in particular, among Gen Z, a return to trusted brands and brands with some nostalgia. We think that these are really long-term demographic trends that are going to benefit us for a long time.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter performance demonstrates again that the combination of our balanced portfolio with the effective execution of our strategies to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends and the strong engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth. Remarkably, we delivered an 8% sales increase versus last year and 17% versus 2019. 
Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we delivered organic sales growth on top of our exceptional third quarter performance last year. Our third quarter results also include strong contributions from Cholula and FONA. Sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment was broad based with the at-home products in our portfolio, flavors and seasonings, growing at approximately the same rate as our away-from-home product, which was primarily driven by a robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers attributable to COVID-19 restrictions and consumers' reluctance to dine out. 
Our Consumer segment results reflect the lapping of the year ago elevated demand and the lockdown date of the pandemic from consumers eating and cooking more at home as well as a sustained shift to Consumer at-home consumption higher than prepandemic levels. Taken together, these results continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. The breadth and reach of our portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels creates a balanced and diversified portfolio that enables us to drive consistency in our performance even in a volatile environment. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total third quarter sales grew 8% from the year ago period or 5% in constant currency. Substantial constant currency sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment more than offset slight constant currency sales decline in our Consumer segment, driven by the factors I just mentioned. Adjusted operating income was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher cost inflation and industry-wide logistics challenges as well as by a shift in sales between segments. 
On the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 in the year ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures. As we have stated previously, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021. Importantly, we have delivered outstanding year-to-date performance. Sales and adjusted operating income are up 13% and 9% year-over-year, respectively, both of which include a 3% favorable impact from currency. And we've grown adjusted earnings per share of 8%. Year-to-date versus 2019, we've driven sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly 20% across all 3 metrics. 
I'd like to say a few words about the current cost environment impact on our third quarter results as well as our outlook, which Mike will cover in more detail. We stated in our July earnings call, we are operating in a dynamic cost environment and like the rest of the industry experiencing cost pressures. We're seeing broad-based inflation across our raw and packaging materials as well as transportation costs. To partially offset rising costs, we have raised prices where appropriate. But as usual, there is a time lag associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, the phase-in of most of our actions is taking place during the fourth quarter. Those pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment. 
In the last few months, inflation has continued to ratchet up, mainly with packaging and transportation costs. We're experiencing the highest inflationary period of the last decade or even 2. We, along with our peers and customers, are also facing additional pressure in our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity and labor shortages and distribution. These pressures not only impact costs but also negatively impact sales as the addition of further supply chain complexity makes it harder to get orders shipped and received for customers, and this pressure is amplified by continued elevated demand. Overall, we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings, and we expect to manage through this period as we have in the past. 
Now let's turn to our third quarter segment business performance, which includes comparisons to 2019 prepandemic levels as we believe these will be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at home and away from home experienced in the year ago period. Starting on Slide 7. Consumer segment sales grew 1%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency and incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition compared to the highly elevated demand levels in the year ago period. Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a 2-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpaces prepandemic levels. 
or Americas constant currency sales declined 1% in the first quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels declined 10% following a 31% consumption increase in the third quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a 2-year basis. Demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. Shelf conditions are improving, and we're seeing sequential improvement in our share performance. That said,  as I mentioned a moment ago, the current issues related to logistics pressures continue to make it challenging for market leaders like McCormick to keep high demand products in stock, which has prevented us from making further progress in replenishing both retailer and consumer inventories in the third quarter. Importantly, though, we're better positioned than we were last year entering the holiday season and are confident in our holiday merchandising plans. 
Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the third quarter of 2019 was led by double-digit growth in spices  and seasonings, hot sauces, both Cholula and Frank's RedHot, and barbecue sauce as well as our Asian and frozen products. In pure-play e-commerce, we delivered triple-digit growth compared to 2019 with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the sixth consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the same period 2 years ago, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brand. 
Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates versus the same period 2 years ago, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but our smaller brands as well. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. And when our consumers shop, they are buying more of our products than they were prepandemic. McCormick continues to win in hot sauce. Across our brands, McCormick grows to be the #1 hot sauce manufacturer globally earlier this year. In the third quarter, Frank's RedHot, the #1 brand in the U.S., was joined at the top of the category by Cholula, which we have driven to the #2 ranking. 
Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the third quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share across the region in key categories following our strong gains in the third quarter last year. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, our total EMEA region, we drove double-digit consumption growth in herbs, spices and seasonings. And turning up the heat, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption 75% and is gaining significant share versus the 2-year ago period. Across the region, our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the 2-year ago period. 
Our year-to-date higher brand marketing investments in the EMEA are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed as well as our achieving above benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click-through, for instance, in our digital marketing. In the Asia/Pacific region, third quarter sales were strong, reflecting our continued recovery from China's lower brand foodservice sales last year. Our consumer product demand in the region declined due to lapping significant growth last year. The region has also experienced supply chain challenges with ocean freight capacity constraints impacting the quarter's growth. In Australia, we continue to see strong consumption growth versus 2019 with key brands recently trending back toward 2020 levels, with Frank's RedHot already higher than last year's elevated consumption. 
Across all regions in our Consumer segment, we are continuing to fuel our growth with our strong brand marketing, new product launches and our category management initiatives. We're making brand marketing investments across our portfolio to connect with our consumers, particularly online. Early in the third quarter in the Americas, we began our search for the first Director of Taco Relations. This was a dream opportunity for the over 5,000 applicants to showcase their taco expertise and enthusiasm for our product and their video application. To date, we have garnered over 1 billion earned impressions related to our search. And these will continue to grow upon the announcement of our new Director of Taco Relations next week on October 4 in celebration of National Taco Day. 
We're not only creating buzz through our digital marketing, but also with our e-commerce direct-to-consumer new product launches. In the Americas, we drove new passionate users to our brands and digital properties with the launch of Sunshine All-Purpose Seasoning, a new product developed in partnership with social media influencer Tabitha Brown. Inspired by her joyful personality and health- and wellness-focused recipes, the salt-free and gluten-free Caribbean-inspired blend sold out in just 39 minutes, generating record sales from e-commerce-driven innovation and over 700 million earned impressions. 
Our new product launches differentiate our brands and strengthen our relevance with consumers. And with our global leadership position in hot sauce, we are in a perfect position to capitalize on consumers' rising demand for hot and spicy flavors through a global heat platform. Our recent launches of Frank's RedHot frozen appetizers and Cholula wing sauces in the Americas as well as Frank's RedHot craft flavors in the EMEA have made strong contributions to growth in the third quarter. Just in time for Halloween, EMEA is introducing DeadHot gift sets for e-commerce, featuring Frank's RedHot. And in China, our recently launched ready-to-eat chilli paste has the highest 30-day repeat rate of all McCormick direct-to-consumer products on Tmall. 
Turning to category management. Our initiatives are designed to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both McCormick and retailers. These initiatives include simply changing shelf placement, for instance, increasing Cholula's velocity over 30% by changing its aisle placement at a large retailer, to reinventing the spice and seasoning shopping experience. In the U.S., we're anticipating a cumulative implementation of our spice program since it began in 2020 of 10,000 stores by year-end. Versus 2019 to remove year-over-year noise, sales through the beginning of August show retailers that have adopted spice aisle changes are growing the category faster than those who have not. And McCormick's branded spice and season in portfolio is growing solid mid-single digits faster in implemented stores versus stores which have not adopted the changes. 
And in Eastern Europe, the rollout of our First Choice bottle, which was perceived as premium in what was predominantly a sachet only market, is elevating the spices and seasoning category and driving increased share in our Eastern European market. Moving forward, we are confident that we will continue the momentum of our Consumer segment. We have more consumers than prepandemic. They have come into our brand, are having a good experience and are buying our products again. We're excited about our growth trajectory and expect long-lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 21% or 17% in constant currency, reflecting both strong base business growth and contributions from our FONA and Cholula acquisition. Our third quarter results include the robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers, many of which are lapping the curtailment of away-from-home dining as well as strong continued momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and the away-from-home products in our portfolio. On a 2-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all 3 regions. 
In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant third quarter growth. And we're executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. We continue to see outstanding growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers through new products and base business strength. 
Consumers' rising global demand for hot and spicy flavors is driving growth for both our customers snacks and for our seasonings that flavor them. Compared to last year's third quarter, snack seasonings grew high single digits, but strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. 
Our confidence that FONA will accelerate our global flavors platform continues to be reinforced by their excellent performance with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages are driving significant growth with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category. And finally, in the Americas, branded foodservice contributed significant growth for the quarter as our demand for this channel has continued to strengthen as more dining options reopen. 
In EMEA, we had strong growth versus both last year and 2019 across all markets and channels. Quick service restaurants, or QSRs, are driving growth through increased promotional activities and limited time offers. Our branded foodservice sales with easing restrictions in the hospitality industry increased at a double-digit rate versus the third quarter of last year. And as packaged food and beverage company, our performance was strong on top of last year's strong growth with the hot and spicy trends fueling growth in snack seasoning, particularly through new product innovation. Our sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region was partially impacted by the timing of our QSR customers' strong limited time offers and their promotional activities in the third quarter of last year, which increased restaurant traffic as COVID-19 restrictions lifted. As we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter-to-quarter. 
We recognize a part of our third quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to low away-from-home demand last year. Notably, our growth also includes strong contributions from FONA and Cholula, robust growth with packaged food and beverage customers, both in the base business and the new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with QSRs. Year-to-date versus 2019, we've delivered 13% constant currency growth, including FONA and Cholula, and 6% constant currency organic growth. These results, combined with our effective growth strategies, bolster our confidence in the continuation of our robust growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
Now on Slide 10, I'm excited to share some important purpose-led performance news. Just a few days ago, we were named as a global compact lead company by the United Nations for our ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles for responsible business. We are honored by this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and to be 1 of only 37 companies in the world and the only U.S.-based food producer to be included on this prestigious list. 
Sustainable sourcing is a top priority, and we've been actively working on initiatives such as our sustainability-linked financing partnership with IFC and Citi, which provides our urban by suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability as well as our partnership with Heather International on the launch of the [indiscernible] Forestry Project, which aims to increase small, older farmer resilience and improve the quality of cardamom and all spice in Guatemala. 
In addition, Latina Style, Inc. recently named us as one of the top 50 best companies for Latinas to work in the U.S. We are thrilled to be recognized for our continued efforts around diversity and inclusion. We are committed to the long-term vitality of the people, communities and the planet we share and are proud of our impact in these areas. We look forward to sharing more about these accomplishments as well as many others with you through our purpose-led performance report, which will be issued early next year. 
Before turning it over to Mike, I'd like to make some qualitative comments regarding 2022. To be clear, we are not providing 2022 guidance at this time. We are a growth company, and we expect to grow in both of our segments next year. At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor fueled by younger generations. We've intentionally focused on great categories that are growing and generating a long-term tailwind. We're capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, and we're successfully executing on our strategies and initiatives. 
In this dynamic and fast-paced environment, we are ensuring that we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. Recently, cost pressures have rapidly accelerated, and we're preparing for them to remain in 2022. We plan to mitigate these costs, which we expect to fully offset over time through a combination of CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and pricing actions as needed. In addition, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. We also expect the impact of COVID-19 to persist into 2022, which will create continued broad-based supply chain challenges. We've successfully demonstrated in the past our ability to manage through inflationary environments and cost pressures. Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence that our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top line growth and margin expansion. We have a strong foundation and remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. 
Around the world, McCormick employees drive our momentum and success, and I thank them for their hard work, engagement and dedication, particularly in such a volatile environment. And now I'll turn it over to Mike."

Starting on Slide 13. Our top line growth continues to be strong. We grew constant currency sales 5% during the third quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 4% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove our organic sales increase with Flavor Solutions' growth offsetting a decline in the Consumer segment. Versus the third quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency with both segments growing double digits. 
During the third quarter, our Consumer segment continued to lap last year's exceptionally high demand. Versus 2020, our third quarter Consumer segment sales declined 1% in constant currency, which includes a 3% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Consumer segment sales grew 14% in constant currency. 
On Slide 14, Consumer segment sales in the Americas declined 1% in constant currency, lapping the elevated lockdown demand in the year ago period as well as the logistics challenges Lawrence mentioned earlier. Incremental sales from the Cholula acquisition contributed 3% growth. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 17% in constant currency, led by significant growth in the McCormick, Lawry's, Grill Mates, Old Bay, Frank's RedHot, Cholula, Zatarain, Gourmet Garden, Simply Asia, Stubb's and El Guapo-branded products, that's a lot of brands, partially offset by a decline in private label. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales declined 11% from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes strong growth in our Eastern European market, on top of their significant volume growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 10% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our Kamis, Schwartz and Frank's RedHot branded products. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 11% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales increased 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery. 
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales of 17%, including an 8% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase, led by the Americas and EMEA regions, was due to strong growth with both packaged food and beverage customers and in away-from-home products. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency. 
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 19% year-over-year, with FONA and Cholula contributing 12%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales through branded to service customers, together with growth to packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 19% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 23% versus the third quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2019, both driven by QSR growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 10% to $188 million or in constant currency 12%, driven by the cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges, partially offset by CCI-led cost savings. These logistics challenges not only impacted costs but also negatively impacted sales. 
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 32% to $84 million or 27% in constant currency. Higher sales, CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix as we continue to migrate our portfolio more than offset the cost pressures in this segment. Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERP program was offset by lower COVID-19 costs compared to last year. During the quarter, we invested in brand marketing ahead of last year. And notably, we have increased our investments 11% on a year-to-date basis. 
As seen on Slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points driven primarily by the cost pressures we are experiencing and the lag in pricing. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 110 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 150 basis points. In addition to the factors I mentioned a few moments ago, a sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both gross and operating margins. 
Turning to income taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 14.1% compared to 19.3% in the year-ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a larger impact this year due to the favorable impact of a reversal of a tax accrual. Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 5% versus the third quarter of 2020. Based on our year-to-date results, we now expect a mid-single-digit increase in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations for 2021, up from our previous projection of a low single-digit decrease. This improvement is driven by strong performance from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by a lower adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the third quarter of 2019, our 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by sales growth. 
On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2021, our cash flow from operations was $373 million, which is lower than the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction and integration costs and higher use of cash associated with working capital. This includes the impact of planned higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues as well as buffer against cost volatility. Through the third quarter, we've returned $272 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $190 million for capital expenditures. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 27 and 28. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and underlying performance, tempered by the higher inflation ahead of pricing and the logistic challenges we previously mentioned. For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We continue to expect an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales and for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 9% to 10%, which is the high end of our previous projection of 8% to 10% and includes a 4% incremental impact from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We had initially projected an incremental acquisition impact in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management brand marketing and new products as well as pricing. We're now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 150 to 170 basis points lower than 2020 due to the increase in cost pressures I mentioned earlier. While we continue to expect a mid-single-digit increase in inflation for the year, it has moved higher and is now approaching a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter. Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impact from sales mix between segments, cost inflation and COVID-19 costs, partially offset by pricing and margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and is weighted to the first half of the year. Reflecting the change in gross profit margin outlook, we are lowering our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 8% to 10% constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges and partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 4% to 6% in constant currency. This projection includes the mid-single-digit inflationary pressure as well as our CCI-led cost save target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments. 
Considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items, we now project our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 21% as compared to our previous projection of 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 1%. We are lowering our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 5% to 7% growth., which includes a favorable impact from currency. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income tax rate as well as the higher adjusted income from unconsolidated operations. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020 and represents 8% to 10% growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. 
I'll now turn it back to Lawrence."

Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we grow strong sales growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date versus 2019, we have driven significant double-digit growth rates for sales, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and are continuing the momentum we are gaining in away-from-home consumption. We're confident the growth momentum of our business is sustainable. As a reminder, McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of short-term pressures. Our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term growth algorithm to drive continuous value creation to top line growth and margin expansion. We're driving McCormick forward and building value for our shareholders. 
Now let's turn to your questions."

I think you also had mentioned that ERP costs could be offset by COVID expenses coming down. So I guess things remain very fluid, of course, and you're not obviously giving specific '22 guidance as of yet. But I'm trying to get a sense of whether sort of an on algorithm year, particularly on the profit side, would be too much to ask in fiscal '22 at this stage, all things considered, particularly given what I assume will be continued margin pressure at least through the first half of next year."

Well, first of all, Andrew, thanks for the opportunity to talk about a pretty high-level question right out of the gate. In your question, you used a couple of my points that I would actually make to answer it, beginning with, just to be clear, I'm not going to give guidance for next year. There are a lot of moving parts. Things are fluid. We are right in the middle of putting together our budgets for next year right now. As we said in the call, our long -- we're very confident about our algorithm over the long term. I'm just not ready to talk about it in 2022 specifically just yet. 
But in our prepared marks, I did say we expect growth in both segments. And so I'll start there and then I'll bring it back to profit. Our -- McCormick is unique in that we've been differentiated by strong growth. The underlying trends that support our business includes a demographic tailwind from younger consumers that has nothing to do with the pandemic. And then many of the consumption trends, we believe, were reinforced and accelerated by the pandemic. So we believe that going into the pandemic, our growth was differentiated already. Through it, it's been differentiated. And coming out, it continues to be differentiated. We made investments, including during the time of this pandemic, both organic and through smart acquisitions that put our portfolio more and more into high-growth categories like hot sauce and flavor. And on top of this, we're going to have the top line benefit of pricing in 2022. So we have confidence in strong growth going forward. 
For operating profit, there are a lot of puts and takes. Over the last few years, we've had rising ERP investment. Over the last 2, we've had the shock of extraordinary COVID costs. And right now we, as everyone else, not just in our industry but across business in general, are wrestling with decades-high inflation. And we're -- that's an area where we're not unique. The first 2 of these, rising European investment versus COVID cost, those should largely offset in 2022. And I think just given the magnitude of the cost that we've described previously, everyone should have an expectation around those largely offsetting. And versus the cost pricing is going to kick in. Pricing has lagged. Pricing in the U.S., largely going into effect in the fourth quarter in particular. And so I would expect that we would see -- you should expect to see the benefits from that not just on the top line, but running through the P&L. But remember, the math says that margins compress when we take pricing. Our approach is to take pricing to pass through costs, and so both the numerator and the denominator go up and so the fraction gets a little bit smaller. So while we do expect that pricing to come in, it would be reasonable to expect some level of margin compression. Nonetheless, with the pricing action and other steps we'll take to offset cost and the top line growth that we expect, I think it's very reasonable to expect solid operating profit growth next year. I'm not ready yet to say if it's exactly on [indiscernible]"

We've made organic investments in that part of the business. We've done acquisitions in that part of the business to accelerate the growth. And as the portfolio continues to shift in that direction, it's going to drive, really, a structural improvement in margin. Those are just categories that command a better margin, and it's going to mix the business up. And at the same time, we've made the decision to get out of some of the lower-margin stuff, some of which is really low margin.

And if you strip out the acquisition, demand -- consumption is up 19%. Our shipments are up 13%. So just this right math on that would suggest we undershipped by about 6 percentage points, which is very substantial. We did that same math in Q2, and it was -- we were ahead by 4. So it would look like we've unwound some of the inventory build that we did. But in 2019, we had a holiday terms program in place, which we normally would do. I mean normally in the third quarter, we're starting to build trade inventories from the heavy fall season. And so that would have been part of the underlying demand. So when you net that all out, we think we're pretty close to even on shipping versus the true change in consumption. But that includes not being able to build for the trade inventories for the holiday as we would have hoped. And so we do think that we're a bit -- as I said on one of the questions earlier, the trade channel right now is a bit starved for inventory in the U.S. Now we think of that as really sloshing between third and fourth quarter, and it's still going to end up getting captured within the year. So it doesn't much change our outlook for the full year. It makes us anticipate a pretty strong fourth quarter. But to bring it back to where we are in rebuilding, we're not as far along as we would have hoped."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our third quarter performance demonstrates again that the combination of our balanced portfolio with the effective execution of our strategies to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends and the strong engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth. Remarkably, we delivered an 8% sales increase versus last year and 17% versus 2019.
Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we delivered organic sales growth on top of our exceptional third quarter performance last year. Our third quarter results also include strong contributions from Cholula and FONA. 
Sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment was broad based with the at-home products in our portfolio, flavors and seasonings, growing at approximately the same rate as our away-from-home product, which was primarily driven by a robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers attributable to COVID-19 restrictions and consumers' reluctance to dine out.
Our Consumer segment results reflect the lapping of the year ago elevated demand in the lockdown days of the pandemic from consumers eating and cooking more at home as well as a sustained shift to Consumer at-home consumption higher than prepandemic levels. Taken together, these results continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, the breadth and reach of our portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels creates a balanced and diversified portfolio that enables us to drive consistency in our performance even in a volatile environment. 
Turning to Slide 5. Total third quarter sales grew 8% from the year ago period or 5% in constant currency. Substantial constant currency sales growth in our Flavor Solutions segment more than offset slight constant currency sales decline in our Consumer segment, driven by the factors I just mentioned. Adjusted operating income was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher cost inflation and industry-wide logistics challenges as well as by a shift in sales between segments. On the bottom line, our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 in the year ago period, driven by higher sales and a lower tax rate, partially offset by cost pressures. 
As we have stated previously, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021. Importantly, we have delivered outstanding year-to-date performance. Sales and adjusted operating income are up 13% and 9% year-over-year, respectively, both of which include a 3% favorable impact from currency. And we've grown adjusted earnings per share 8%. Year-to-date versus 2019, we've driven sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share growth of nearly 20% across all 3 metrics. 
I'd like to say a few words about the current cost environment's impact on our third quarter results as well as our outlook, which Mike will cover in more detail. We stated in our July earnings call we are operating in a dynamic cost environment, and like the rest of the industry, experiencing cost pressures. We're seeing broad-based inflation across our raw and packaging materials as well as transportation costs. To partially offset rising costs, we have raised prices where appropriate. But as usual, there is a time lag associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. And therefore, the phase-in of most of our actions is taking place during the fourth quarter. Those pricing actions are on track, and we appreciate our customers working with us to navigate this environment.
In the last few months, inflation has continued to ratchet up, mainly with packaging and transportation costs. We're experiencing the highest inflationary period of the last decade or even 2. We, along with our peers and customers, are also facing additional pressure in our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity and labor shortages and distribution. These pressures not only impact costs but also negatively impact sales as the addition of further supply chain complexity makes it harder to get orders shipped and received by customers, and this pressure is amplified by continued elevated demand. Overall, we have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary periods with a combination of pricing and cost savings, and we expect to manage through this period as we have in the past.
Now let's turn to our third quarter segment business performance, which includes comparisons to 2019 prepandemic levels as we believe these will be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at home and away from home experienced in the year ago period. Starting on Slide 7. Consumer segment sales grew 1%, including a 2% favorable impact from currency and incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition compared to the highly elevated demand levels in the year ago period. Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a 2-year basis was up double digits, highlighting how the sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our product and outpaces prepandemic levels.
Our Americas constant currency sales declined 1% in the first quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, declined 10% following a 31% consumption increase in the third quarter of 2020, which results in a 19% increase on a 2-year basis. Demand has remained high, and we are realizing the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion, although some products remain stretched by sustained high demand. 
Shelf conditions are improving, and we're seeing sequential improvement in our share performance. That said, as I mentioned moments ago, the current issues related to logistics pressures continue to make it challenging for market leaders, like McCormick, to keep high demand products in stock, which has prevented us from making further progress in replenishing both retailer and consumer inventories in the third quarter. Importantly though, we're better positioned than we were last year entering the holiday season and are confident in our holiday merchandising plans. 
Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our 19% consumption growth versus the third quarter of 2019 was led by double-digit growth in spices and seasonings; hot sauces, both Cholula and Frank's RedHot; and barbecue sauce as well as our Asian and frozen products. In pure-play e-commerce, we delivered triple-digit growth compared to 2019 with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories. This is the sixth consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double digits versus the same period 2 years ago, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brand. 
Our key categories continue to outpace the center-of-store growth rates versus the same period 2 years ago, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but our smaller brands as well. Household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus 2019. And when our consumers shop, they are buying more of our products than they were prepandemic. 
McCormick continues to win in hot sauce. Across our brands, McCormick rose to be the #1 hot sauce manufacturer globally earlier this year. In the third quarter, Frank's RedHot, the #1 brand in the U.S., was joined at the top of the category by Cholula, which we have driven to the #2 ranking.
Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. We had strong market share performance in the third quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share across the region in key categories following our strong gains in the third quarter last year. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, our total EMEA region, we drove double-digit consumption growth in herbs, spices and seasonings. And turning up the heat, Frank's RedHot has grown consumption 75% and is gaining significant share versus the 2-year ago period. Across the region, our household penetration and repeat rates have also grown versus the 2-year ago period. Our year-to-date higher brand marketing investments in the EMEA are proving to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed as well as our achieving above-benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click-through, for instance, in our digital marketing. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, third quarter sales were strong, reflecting our continued recovery from China's lower branded foodservice sales last year. Our consumer product demand in the region declined due to lapping significant growth last year. The region has also experienced supply chain challenges with ocean freight capacity constraints impacting the quarter's growth. In Australia, we continue to see strong consumption growth versus 2019 with key brands recently trending back toward 2020 levels, with Frank's RedHot already higher than last year's elevated consumption.
Across all regions in our Consumer segment, we are continuing to fuel our growth with our strong brand marketing, new product launches and our category management initiatives. We're making brand marketing investments across our portfolio to connect with our consumers, particularly online. 
Early in the third quarter in the Americas, we began our search for the first Director of Taco Relations. This was a dream opportunity for the over 5,000 applicants who showcased their taco expertise and enthusiasm for our product in their video application. To date, we have garnered over 1 billion earned impressions related to our search. And these will continue to grow upon the announcement of our new Director of Taco Relations next week on October 4 in celebration of National Taco Day.
We're not only creating buzz through our digital marketing, but also with our e-commerce direct-to-consumer new product launches. In the Americas, we drove new, passionate users to our brands and digital properties with the launch of Sunshine All-Purpose Seasoning, a new product developed in partnership with social media influencer, Tabitha Brown. Inspired by her joyful personality and health- and wellness-focused recipes, the salt-free and gluten-free Caribbean-inspired blend sold out in just 39 minutes, generating record sales from e-commerce-driven innovation and over 700 million earned impressions.
Our new product launches differentiate our brands and strengthen our relevance with consumers. And with our global leadership position in hot sauce, we are in a perfect position to capitalize on consumers' rising demand for hot-and-spicy flavors through a global heat platform. Our recent launches of Frank's RedHot frozen appetizers and Cholula wing sauces in the Americas as well as Frank's RedHot craft flavors in the EMEA have made strong contributions to growth in the third quarter. 
Just in time for Halloween, EMEA is introducing dead-hot gift sets for e-commerce, featuring Frank's RedHot. And in China, our recently launched ready-to-eat chili paste has the highest 30-day repeat rate of all McCormick direct-to-consumer products on Tmall.
Turning to category management. Our initiatives are designed to strengthen our category leadership by driving growth for both McCormick and retailers. These initiatives include simply changing shelf placement, for instance, increasing Cholula's velocity over 30% by changing its aisle placement at a large retailer, to reinventing the spice and seasoning aisle shopping experience. In the U.S., we're anticipating a cumulative implementation of our spice aisle program since it began in 2020 at 10,000 stores by year-end. 
Versus 2019 to remove year-over-year noise, sales through the beginning of August show retailers that have adopted the spice aisle changes are growing the category faster than those who have not. And McCormick's branded spice and seasoning portfolio is growing solid mid-single digits faster in implemented stores versus stores which have not adopted the changes. And in Eastern Europe, the rollout of our first choice bottle, which was perceived as premium in what was predominantly a sachet-only market, is elevating the spices and seasoning category and driving increased share in our Eastern European market. 
Moving forward, we are confident that we will continue the momentum of our Consumer segment. We have more consumers than prepandemic. They have come into our brand, are having a good experience and are buying our products again. We're excited about our growth trajectory and expect long-lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home fueled by our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives.
Turning to Slide 9. Our Flavor Solutions segment grew 21% or 17% in constant currency, reflecting both strong base business growth and contributions from our FONA and Cholula acquisition. Our third quarter results include the robust recovery from last year's lower demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers, many of which are lapping the curtailment of both away-from-home dining as well as strong continued momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. Notably, growth was driven equally from both the at-home and the away-from-home products in our portfolio. On a 2-year basis, our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all 3 regions.
In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant third quarter growth. And we're executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. We continue to see outstanding growth momentum with our consumer packaged food customers through new products and base business strength. Consumers' rising global demand for hot-and-spicy flavors is driving growth for both our customers snacks and for seasonings that flavor them. Compared to last year's third quarter, snack seasonings grew high single digits, but strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust.
Our confidence that FONA will accelerate our global flavors platform continues to be reinforced by their excellent performance with double-digit sales growth compared to last year. Beverages are driving significant growth with particular strength in the fast-growing performance nutrition category. And finally, in the Americas, branded foodservice contributed significant growth to the quarter as our demand for this channel has continued to strengthen as more dining options reopen.
In EMEA, we had strong growth versus both last year and 2019 across all markets and channels. Quick service restaurants, or QSRs, are driving growth through increased promotional activities and limited time offers. Our branded foodservice sales, with easing restrictions in the hospitality industry, increased at a double-digit rate versus the third quarter of last year. And as packaged food and beverage company, our performance was strong on top of last year's strong growth with the hot-and-spicy trend fueling growth in snack seasoning, particularly through new product innovation. 
Our sales growth in the Asia/Pacific region was partially impacted by the timing of our QSR customers' strong limited time offers and their promotional activities in the third quarter of last year, which increased restaurant traffic as COVID-19 restrictions lifted. As we've said in the past, limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter-to-quarter. 
We recognize a part of our third quarter Flavor Solutions results were due to the comparison to low away-from-home demand last year. Notably, our growth also include strong contributions from FONA and Cholula; robust growth with packaged food and beverage customers, both at the base business and in new product wins driven by our differentiated customer engagement and continuing momentum with QSRs. Year-to-date versus 2019, we've delivered 13% constant currency growth, including FONA and Cholula, and 6% constant currency organic growth. These results, combined with our effective growth strategies, bolster our confidence in the continuation of our robust growth trajectory in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
Now on Slide 10, I'm excited to share some important purpose-led performance news. Just a few days ago, we were named as a Global Compact LEAD company by the United Nations for our ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles for responsible business. We are honored by this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and to be 1 of only 37 companies in the world and the only U.S.-based food producer to be included on this prestigious list.
Sustainable sourcing is a top priority, and we've been actively working on initiatives, such as our sustainability-linked financing partnership with IFC and Citi, which provides our urban spice suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability as well as our partnership with Heifer International on the launch of the Cardaforestry project, which aims to increase smallholder farmer resilience and improve the quality of cardamom and allspice in Guatemala.
In addition, LATINA Style Inc. recently named us as one of the top 50 best companies for Latinas to work in the U.S. We are thrilled to be recognized for our continued efforts around diversity and inclusion. 
We are committed to the long-term vitality of the people, communities and the planet we share and are proud of our impact in these areas. We look forward to sharing more about these accomplishments as well as many others with you through our Purpose-led Performance Report, which will be issued early next year.
Before turning it over to Mike, I'd like to make some qualitative comments regarding 2022. To be clear, we are not providing 2022 guidance at this time. We are a growth company, and we expect to grow in both of our segments next year. At the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor fueled by younger generations. We've intentionally focused on great categories that are growing and generating a long-term tailwind. We're capitalizing on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, and we're successfully executing on our strategies and initiatives.
In this dynamic and fast-paced environment, we are ensuring that we remain focused on long-term, sustainable growth. Recently, cost pressures have rapidly accelerated, and we're preparing for them to remain in 2022. We plan to mitigate these costs, which we expect to fully offset over time through a combination of CCI-led cost savings, revenue management initiatives and pricing actions as needed. In addition, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary spend where possible. 
We also expect the impact of COVID-19 to persist into 2022, which will create continued broad-based supply chain challenges. We've successfully demonstrated in the past our ability to manage through inflationary environments and cost pressures. 
Importantly, our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term financial algorithm to drive continuous value creation through top line growth and margin expansion. We have a strong foundation and remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. Around the world, McCormick employees drive our momentum and success, and I thank them for their hard work, engagement and dedication, particularly in such a volatile environment. 
And now I'll turn it over to Mike."

Starting on Slide 13. Our top line growth continues to be strong. We grew constant currency sales 5% during the third quarter compared to last year, with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 4% across both segments. Higher volume and mix drove our organic sales increase with Flavor Solutions' growth offsetting a decline in the Consumer segment. Versus the third quarter of 2019, we grew sales 15% in constant currency with both segments growing double digits.
During the third quarter, our Consumer segment continued to lap last year's exceptionally high demand. Versus 2020, our third quarter Consumer segment sales declined 1% in constant currency, which includes a 3% increase from the Cholula acquisition. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Consumer segment sales grew 14% in constant currency.
On Slide 14, Consumer segment sales in the Americas declined 1% in constant currency, lapping the elevated lockdown demand in the year ago period as well as the logistics challenges Lawrence mentioned earlier. Incremental sales from the Cholula acquisition contributed 3% growth. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 17% in constant currency, led by significant growth in the McCormick, Lawry's, Grill Mates, OLD Bay, Frank's RedHot, Cholula, Zatarain, Gourmet Garden, Simply Asia, Stubb's and El Guapo-branded products. That's a lot of brands. Partially offset by a decline in private label. 
In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales declined 11% from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year. Notably, this decline includes strong growth in our Eastern European market on top of their significant volume growth last year, which was more than offset by declines in the region's other markets. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 10% in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our Kamis, Schwartz and Frank's RedHot branded products. 
Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 11% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period. Sales increased 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, including a sales decline in India, resulting from a slower COVID-19 recovery.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 17%, including an 8% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions. The year-over-year increase, led by the Americas and EMEA regions, was due to strong growth with both packaged food and beverage customers and in away-from-home products. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 16% in constant currency. 
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 19% year-over-year, with FONA and Cholula contributing 12%. Volume and product mix increased driven by significantly higher sales through branded foodservice customers, together with growth from packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings. On a 2-year basis, sales increased 15% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower-margin business.
In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 19% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies. Constant currency sales increased 23% versus the third quarter of 2019, driven by strong sales growth with packaged food and beverage companies and QSR customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 1% in constant currency versus last year and increased 8% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2019, both driven by QSR growth and partially impacted by the timing of our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities.
As seen on Slide 21, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, was comparable to the third quarter of last year, including a 3% favorable impact from currency. Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 10% to $188 million or in constant currency 12%, driven by the cost pressures from inflation and logistics challenges, partially offset by CCI-led cost savings. These logistics challenges not only impacted costs but also negatively impacted sales. 
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 32% to $84 million or 27% in constant currency. Higher sales, CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix as we continue to migrate our portfolio more than offset the cost pressures in this segment. Across both segments, incremental investment spending for our ERP program was offset by lower COVID-19 costs compared to last year. During the quarter, we invested in brand marketing ahead of last year. And notably, we have increased our investments 11% on a year-to-date basis.
As seen on Slide 22, adjusted gross profit margin declined 260 basis points, driven primarily by the cost pressures we are experiencing and the lag in pricing. Our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales declined 110 basis points, driven by leverage from sales growth. These impacts netted to an adjusted operating margin decline of 150 basis points. In addition to the factors I mentioned a few moments ago, a sales shift between segments unfavorably impacted both gross and operating margins.
Turning to income taxes. Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 14.1% compared to 19.3% in the year ago period. Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a larger impact this year due to the favorable impact of a reversal of a tax accrual. 
Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 5% versus the third quarter of 2020. Based on our year-to-date results, we now expect a mid-single-digit increase in our adjusted income from unconsolidated operations for 2021, up from our previous projection of a low single-digit decrease. This improvement is driven by strong performance from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.80 compared to $0.76 for the year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by a lower adjusted income tax rate. As compared to the third quarter of 2019, our 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by sales growth.
On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2021, our cash flow from operations was $373 million, which is lower than the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of transaction and integration costs and higher use of cash associated with working capital. This includes the impact of planned higher inventory levels to support significantly increased demand and to mitigate supply and service issues as well as buffer against cost volatility. 
Through the third quarter, we've returned $272 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $190 million for capital expenditures. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. 
Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 27 and 28. With our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and underlying performance, tempered by the higher inflation ahead of pricing and the logistic challenges we previously mentioned. 
For 2021, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate. We continue to expect an estimated 3 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, and for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates. 
At the top line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we now expect to grow constant currency sales 9% to 10%, which is the high end of our previous projection of 8% to 10% and includes a 4% incremental impact from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. We had initially projected an incremental acquisition impact in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing and new products as well as pricing. 
We're now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 150 to 170 basis points lower than 2020 due to the increase in cost pressures I mentioned earlier. While we continue to expect a mid-single-digit increase in inflation for the year, it has moved higher and is now approaching a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter. Overall, our projected adjusted gross margin compression reflects unfavorable impact from sales mix between segments, cost inflation and COVID-19 costs, partially offset by pricing and margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions. 
As a reminder, we price to offset cost increases. We do not margin up. Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and is weighted to the first half of the year. 
Reflecting the change in gross profit margin outlook, we are lowering our expected constant currency adjusted operating income growth. Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 8% to 10% constant currency growth, which includes the higher inflation ahead of pricing and logistics challenges and partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 4% to 6% in constant currency. This projection includes the mid-single-digit inflationary pressure as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an expected low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments.
Considering the year-to-date impact from discrete items, we now project our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 21% as compared to our previous projection of 23%. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 1%. 
We are lowering our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 5% to 7% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency. This reflects our lower adjusted operating profit outlook and lower adjusted income tax rate as well as the higher adjusted income from unconsolidated operations. 
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $2.97 to $3.02. This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020 and represents 8% to 10% growth in constant currency from our strong base business and acquisition performance, partially offset by the impacts related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind.
I'll now turn it back to Lawrence."

Our third quarter results reflect a robust and sustained growth momentum as we grow strong sales growth despite a challenging year-over-year comparison. Year-to-date versus 2019, we have driven significant double-digit growth rates for sales, adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. We have a strong foundation and a balanced portfolio, which drives consistency in our performance. We expect higher at-home consumption will persist beyond the pandemic and are continuing the momentum we are gaining in away-from-home consumption. We're confident the growth momentum of our business is sustainable. 
As a reminder, McCormick has grown and compounded that growth successfully over the years regardless of short-term pressures. Our strong growth trajectory supports our confidence in our long-term growth algorithm to drive continuous value creation to top line growth and margin expansion. We're driving McCormick forward and building value for our shareholders.
Now let's turn to your questions."

Others have made very similar sort of comments. Of course, you'll have more pricing kicking in, among other actions, to mitigate some of the challenges. I think you also had mentioned that ERP costs could be offset by COVID expenses coming down. So I guess things remain very fluid, of course, and you're not obviously giving specific '22 guidance as of yet. But I'm trying to get a sense of whether sort of an on-algorithm year, particularly on the profit side, would be too much to ask in fiscal '22 at this stage, all things considered, particularly given what I assume will be continued margin pressure at least through the first half of next year."

Well, first of all, Andrew, thanks for the opportunity to talk about a pretty high-level question right out of the gate. In your question, you included a couple of my points that I would actually make to answer it. Beginning with, just to be clear,",549,"Right. Well, first of all, Andrew, thanks for the opportunity to talk about a pretty high-level question right out of the gate. In your question, you included a couple of my points that I would actually make to answer it. Beginning with, just to be clear, I'm not going to give guidance for next year. It's -- there are a lot of moving parts. Things are fluid. We are right in the middle of putting together our budgets for next year right now. 
As we said in the call, our long -- we're very confident about our algorithm over the long term. I'm just not ready to talk about it in 2022 specifically just yet. But in our prepared marks, I did say we expect growth in both segments. And so I'll start there and then I'll bring it back to profit. 
Our -- McCormick is unique in that we've been differentiated by strong growth. The underlying trends that support our business includes a demographic tailwind from younger consumers that has nothing to do with the pandemic. And then many of the consumption trends, we believe, were reinforced and accelerated by the pandemic. So we believe that going into the pandemic, our growth was differentiated already. Through it, it's been differentiated. And coming out, it continues to be differentiated. 
We've made investments, including during the time of this pandemic, both organic and through smart acquisitions that put our portfolio more and more into high-growth categories like hot sauce and flavor. And on top of this, we're going to have the top line benefit of pricing in 2022. So we have confidence in strong growth going forward.
For operating profit, there are a lot of puts and takes. Over the last few years, we've had rising ERP investment. Over the last 2, we've had the shock of extraordinary COVID costs. And right now we, as everyone else, not just in our industry but across business in general, are wrestling with decades-high inflation. And we're -- that's an area where we're not unique. 
The first 2 of these, rising European investment versus COVID costs, those should largely offset in 2022. And I think that given the magnitude of the cost, as we've described them previously, everyone should have an expectation around those largely offsetting. 
And versus the cost pricing is going to kick in. Pricing has lagged, we -- our pricing in the U.S., largely going into effect in the fourth quarter in particular. And so I would expect that we would see -- you should expect to see the benefits from that not just on the top line, but running through the P&L. 
But remember, the math says that margins compress when we take pricing. Our approach is to take pricing to pass through costs, and so both the numerator and the denominator go up. And so the fraction gets a little bit smaller. So while we do expect that pricing to come in, it would be reasonable to expect some level of margin compression. Nonetheless, with the pricing action and other steps we'll take to offset cost and the top line growth that we expect, I think it's very reasonable to expect solid operating profit growth next year. I'm not ready yet to say if it's exactly on algorithm."

All of our actions on pricing are on track, particularly for the U.S. The price increases that we talked about earlier in the year, that's been sold in. There is a time lag, though, especially with how quickly costs have gone up. Inflation has accelerated since we launched those pricing plans. And so there's more work to do in that area in 2022. The phase-in of most of our actions is happening in Q4, and we would expect to see the benefit of that in 2022."

There's been some discussion about inflation not continuing to escalate, but there hasn't been any discussion about just not being a reset of pricing levels. And I think that there's broad recognition of that. And I will say that I was on a call with Chairman Jerome Powell yesterday where he was saying very much the same thing. 
And so I think that the outlook is that these costs are not transient.

You've seen globally in the U.K. natural gas challenges and things like that, too, and trucking challenges. So it's both getting it here and getting it to customers. 
From a wage rate perspective, we've taken actions just like other companies have to try to aggressively attract talent in our manufacturing facilities and DCs with retention bonuses and other actions like that.

The -- we have great confidence in the margin trajectory of our Flavor Solutions business. We're really changing the portfolio. The big driver of our margin improvement over time has been the shift in the portfolio to more value-added, technically insulated products. We've made organic investments in that part of the business. We've done acquisitions in that part of the business to accelerate the growth. And as the portfolio continues to shift in that direction, it's going to drive a -- kind of a really, a structural improvement in margin. Those are just categories that command a better margin, and it's going to mix the business up. 
And at the same time, we've made the decision to get out of some of the lower-margin stuff, some of which is really low margin. And we found graceful ways of exiting some of that without getting on the wrong side of the customer relationships.

So just this right math on that would suggest we undershipped by about 6 percentage points, which is very substantial. We did that same math in Q2, and it was -- we were ahead by 4%. So it would look like we've unwound some of the inventory build that we did. 
But in 2019, we had a holiday terms program in place, which we normally would do. I mean normally in the third quarter, we're starting to build trade inventories for the heavy fall season. And so that would have been part of the underlying demand. 
So when you net that all out, we think we're pretty close to even on shipping versus the true change in consumption. But that includes not being able to build for the trade inventories for the holiday as we would have hoped. And so we do think that we're a bit -- that as I said on one of the questions earlier, that the trade channel right now is a bit starved for inventory in the U.S. 
Now we think of that as really sloshing between third and fourth quarter, and it's still going to end up getting captured within the year. So it doesn't much change our outlook for the full year.

And so it's pricing actions that we're going forward for our -- include the private label products that we manufacture.

Our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment.
We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees and recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, 2 fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond.
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile times as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. The sustained shift of consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. 
On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away-from-home products in our portfolio. The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away-from-home consumption and eat as well as the pace of each region's COVID-19 recovery. 
Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. And our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.
This morning, I will begin with our fourth quarter results, reflect on our 2020 achievements and then share with you some of our 2021 business momentum and plans. After that, I will turn it over to Mike, who will go in more depth on the quarter and fiscal year results as well as the details of our 2021 guidance.
Turning to Slide 6. Starting with our fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call. On our top line, versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. Adjusted operating income declined 4% as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with a partial offset from lower interest expense.
Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance. Starting on Slide 7, in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6% on constant currency, 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data grew 14%, which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.
As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. To protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution. And consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and club stores as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.
Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio. In spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. While fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints, this had double-digit growth for the year as did spices and seasonings and the other key categories. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broths, barbecue sauce, wet marinade and Asian products. The majority of our categories continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.
While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the 5 weeks ending January 17 showed total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5%, with continued strength in spices and seasonings. Consumers are continuing to come to our brands, have a good experience and buy our products again.
In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on holiday proving to be successful. And our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. And with the manufacturing capacity, we've recently added, we are well positioned moving into 2021 and will continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovation.
Now turning to EMEA. Our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories. Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, and our Vahiné brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category.
In the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. The foodservice industry is continuing to recover but at a gradual pace. Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.
Turning to Slide 8. Our sales performance in Flavor Solutions returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3%, and all 3 regions contributed to the sales growth. In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products.
Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and in the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice, growth of 2%. In the Asia/Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant or QSR customers, where we continue to see momentum in limited time offers and the core business, partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.
Moving from our fourth quarter results. I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments, which not only highlight what we have achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. Now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment, led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurants and other foodservice customers.
We achieved $113 million of annual cost saves driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth. And there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.
2020 was the ninth consecutive year of record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. We're making great progress with our working capital improvements.
At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.
Now I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. We expect the consumer shift to increase online shopping to continue, and we are well positioned for the opportunities still ahead.
We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments increasing 7% in fiscal 2020, most recently with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. We designed targeted media messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. Our digital leadership was again recognized as we were ranked as the #1 food brand, with the highest designation of GENIUS, by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. rankings. This is the seventh year in a row we were ranked in the top 5 food and beverage brands.
We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc top 50 company. And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as #1 in the food products industry for the fifth consecutive year as well as the #1 U.S. company overall and globally #6 overall.
Finally, during the year, we continued to invest to expand our global infrastructure. In the Americas, we broke ground on a new ""state of the art"" Northeast distribution center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. In our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth. These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.
Turning to 2021. Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments, but I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plans. 
Starting on Slide 11. In addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms through the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. Cholula, an iconic brand in a high-growth category, is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and foodservice operators. FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors, increases the scale of our global flavors platform with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration to more value-added and technically insulated products.
We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December, respectively. For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans, and the alignment of our organizations is underway to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. 
We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. In our Consumer segment, we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extend its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021, continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. 
In our Flavor Solutions segment, with our broad presence across all foodservice channels, we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. There are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution in its existing foodservice channels as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth. McCormick's reach across customers, combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends, expands the recipe inspiration and flavor solutions that we offer operators.
Turning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration, will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform. By expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we're providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offering, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth. 
With the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio. We're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform with additional proprietary encapsulation methods, including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition products across a variety of applications. Our clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus and fruit flavors. The combination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better-for-you and consumer-preferred Flavor Solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers. 
Our complementary customer bases of global and mid-tier customers provides growth opportunities for our collective portfolios. FONA's customer-centric culture is very similar to ours. And with the combined power of our organization, we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation. Customer response to the acquisition has been favorable as they recognize our combined power increases our customer value proposition.
We're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans. This confidence is bolstered by a proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of acquired businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's. Acquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy, and both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plan, starting on Slide 14. Global demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth. We're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy, flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices. These long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic. Our alignment with these consumer trends, combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio, sustainably positions us for continued growth. These underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.
Starting with our Consumer segment. Around the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trend of consumers cooking more at home. Across our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong. In China, consumer consumption remains strong, and we continue to see recovery in foodservice, which in China is in our Consumer segment, as well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown.
And in Australia, even with restaurant restrictions eased and away-from-home demand increasing, at-home consumption has remained elevated. In EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption. And we're seeing sustained levels of demand. And of course, we see the same in the Americas.
Consumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their meal occasions is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Our proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better-tasting and cost less. And while there have been great advances in vaccine development and distribution, there's a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months. We believe that consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new products and our strong category management initiatives. 
Our categories across the globe experienced a sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift in consumer preference, which, coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operations. The real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations, where through the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity. We ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan. In December, our Americas consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year. 
Currently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top-selling products. We've now resumed shipping approximately 2/3 of the products, which had been suspended, with the balance to be added over the next several weeks. And we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks. We're continuing to work through a stabilization period, and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year. 
Our category management initiatives are designed to drive growth for both our customers and McCormick, and I'd like to thank our customers for their partnership and working together with us on long-term solutions. We're confident we're well positioned for success in 2021, and we've implemented efficient, long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer term to support continued growth.
Also in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience for spices and seasonings to consumers by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration. Our rollout will continue in 2021. And with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth.
Turning to global brand marketing. We continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI. We will continue to connect with consumers online, bringing real-time insights into actions by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration, for instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and product to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy. We expect our brand marketing investments, combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement, will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.
New products are also integral to our sales growth. In 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last 3 years. In our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers. Our 2020 launches provide significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial. 
Overall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big-bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves. Moving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline, both we and our Flavor Solutions customers are carrying into the year.
In our Flavor Solutions segment, we have a diverse customer base and have seen various stages of recovery. From a food-at-home perspective, our Flavor Solutions growth varies by packaged food customer. But overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates. We're carrying our growth momentum with packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic products as well as new products and bigger-bet innovation in 2021. 
In our away-from-home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions in most markets. In some areas, our restaurant customers, including quick service restaurants, have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences. Although the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis, given many customers have adapted their operating models toward delivery and carryout, the recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences.
Overall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun, and we're expecting it to continue in 2021. As QSR customers are oriented less to dine in, their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry. We have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum. We are advantaged by our differentiated customer engagement in Flavor Solutions and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021. With our customer intimacy approach, we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans and importantly, further strengthen our customer partnerships.
Additionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021. With top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale, our momentum in flavor categories as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.
In summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment, have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021. We expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.
The following an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.
Our top-tier, long-term growth objectives remain unchanged, and we're positioned for continued success. Importantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success. During 2020, our employees demonstrated and advanced their skills, agility and resiliency during a highly challenging time, and I would like to thank them for their dedicated efforts and engagement as well as adapted to this new environment.
Now Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance."

I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in con",2128,"Thanks, Lawrence, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full year results as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.
Starting on Slide 19. During the fourth quarter, sales rose 4% in constant currency. Sales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year. Pricing to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.
The Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency led by the Americas and EMEA regions. The sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals, continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.
On Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019 driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands, including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few. Partially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes as well as private-label products due to capacity constraints.
In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago, with strong growth in all countries across the region. The most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros-branded spices and seasonings, our Vahiné homemade dessert products and our Kamis-branded products in Poland. Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year, as Lawrence mentioned.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23. We grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all 3 regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases, offset partially by lower volume and product mix. Volume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. Partially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasonings. 
In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5%, attributable to pricing to cover cost increases as well as higher volume and product mix. Volume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies with strength in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers. In the Asia/Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities. 
As seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges, declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period with minimal impact from currency. Adjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%. In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency. 
Growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers. In the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to its adjusted operating income decline. Both segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation. 
As seen on Slide 28. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year ago period as we had planned. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I mentioned a moment ago as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.
For the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year. 
The Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% in constant currency, primarily due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by a 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs.
In constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20%, driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense, with a partial offset for CCI-led cost savings.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019. Income from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the full year was comparable to 2019. 
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 as compared to $0.81 for the year ago period. The decline was primarily driven by our lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate. 
For the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income, combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.
On Slide 32, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations ended the year at a record high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income. We finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions. 
We returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands. Following the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9x. And we expect to delever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2022. Based on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and our anticipated strong cash flow generation, we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.
Our capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier. In 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we had in progress as well as support our investment to fuel future growth. 
We expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives. And our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.
Now I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first. Starting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program. We are now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses. As such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.
In fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million over fiscal 2020. And at this time, we are not anticipating any significant go-lives in 2021. By the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense. We are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform. 
Moving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance. In our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution, with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 costs and the ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. 
At the top line, we expect to grow constant currency sales 5% to 7%, including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We anticipate our organic growth will be primarily led by higher volume and product mix driven by our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement growth plans. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery. But importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments. 
Our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs. We estimate COVID-19 costs to be approximately $60 million in 2021 as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year. Fiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs and, of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations.
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment. This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency. This projection includes low single-digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million. It also includes an estimated low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.
Our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth of approximately 4%. 
Our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impacts I just mentioned related to COVID-19 costs, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind. This results in an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96, compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.
Based on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. We have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020. 
In summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 costs and ERP investment as well as a higher projected effective tax rate. I'd like to now turn it back to Lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions."

Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35. We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company as well as the successful execution of our strategies. 
We have a strong foundation. We're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends. We're excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforce our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiment and flavors growth platform. We are confident these investments further position us for continued success.
Our fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever. Our 2021 outlook reflects another year of differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future. We are confident we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times.

I guess, first off, I'm curious if those dynamics are in such a place now where we should expect sort of shipments to start to outpace consumption sort of in 1Q and 2Q. Or if you expect still maybe somewhat of a lag effect because you're still building the capacity and the service levels to where you want them to be? 
Because I'm trying to just dimensionalize that sort of first quarter aspect. But more importantly, how to dimensionalize maybe how big of a benefit to 2001 organic growth just a rebuilding of inventory levels to the extent that needs to happen can be to organic growth? And then I just have a quick follow-up."

Well, Andrew, we've been ramping up production as we've gone through the fourth quarter -- and well, really it's through the third and fourth quarter as we talked about on previous calls. And anybody that walks into a store can see that the shelves are pretty poor conditioned. There are a lot of holes in the shelf, particularly in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes that reflect the fact that we've had our secondary SKUs on suspension to protect the key holiday items. And it's really been those 2 categories that's had the greatest impact. 
Our other product categories has had pretty good service through the third and fourth quarter and into this year. So that's been our focus area. 
We have -- starting at the beginning of January, begun reinstating those secondary items. And so they are coming back on. As we said in our prepared remarks, about 2/3 of them have been reinstated and the remainder coming in the coming weeks. So I think you'll see the shelves starting to get a lot better gradually over the next few weeks. 
We still are allocating product. There's a big bow wave of demand ahead of us as our customers want to rebuild their inventory. And frankly, everyone forgets about consumer pantries being a bit bare during this time as well. So we do expect there to be a benefit to this fiscal year. And we're really thinking about it in terms of the first half in terms of the rebuild of Consumer inventory.
I also want to emphasize that this is an Americas problem. Our manufacturing has really been able to keep up with the demand in the rest of the world. It's just the scale of our Consumer business in the Americas is so great, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. Even in normal circumstances, we have to prebuild inventory to supply the huge demand that comes through in those categories in the fourth quarter of the year. And coming into the fourth quarter, very much hand to mouth already due to the sustained demand. That's why we were signaling that we were going to have service issues through the fourth quarter. We knew that to be the case. 
I will say, just commenting on current conditions, and I don't want to get too much into 2021. We were almost 2/3 of the way through our first quarter and the service levels that we are shipping to our customers, while we're still allocating product, it's the best service that we've had since the spring."

Generally in China when the government gives encouragement to do something, they do it. And so I think that right now, for Chinese New Year, I'm not sure we can draw a lot of conclusions around the consumer behavior. 
It's not quite as clean as in Australia, where COVID seems to be under control. Restrictions have been lifted, and consumers are still making the choice without that government encouragement to continue to cook at home."

I don't think we have the same pressure on pricing as maybe some other companies. Our outlook is for low single-digit inflation. We have a unique basket of commodities and input costs that are not an exact match to inflation or an exact match to our peers. We do use CCI as well. 
We are seeing cost inflations. Freight is up. Ocean freight, in particular, is an emerging -- a current and emerging concern. But we're really not prepared to talk about -- make too many specific comments about pricing right now. We do have some wrap from 2020 pricing actions.

Even during that pause, we spent some time rescoping, realigning partners. And we've actually come out of it with a stronger program. We've got a lot of data cleansing done. Those who have been through this before know that's always an issue. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to handle that, handle the recovery of our business. 
And we really are actually quite thrilled about the 2 acquisitions that we made. We've added a great asset in each one of our segments. We think that this has been a great capital allocation decision. And the integration of these are pretty straightforward, I think. Mike, do you want to comment on that?"

But on pricing, there are 2 things that are happening in Nielsen that make it look like there's more pricing perhaps than there actually is. The first is that there's been a bit of a channel shift as we've gone through the crisis, where, I'd say, regular -- I'd say regular grocery has been stronger than other channels and tend to carry a higher price point as a result. And that comes through as pricing inflection in the Nielsen data. That is really kind of artificial, and that was one of the things that I was pointing to. 
And then the other is there's still a reduced level of promotional activity that is happening. And not just for us, but across the board. That comes through as if it was a price increase in the Nielsen data.
As far as the inventory build, we've not really quantified it, but it stands to reason that there's going to be a substantial catch up on trade stock that we will ship to. We have shipped under consumption now for 3 quarters. And I think that you can expect that we will -- as our American supply chain catches up, that we'll -- you'll start to see us shipping above consumption. 
Now consumption is still very strong. I mentioned that our production was up 40% in December for our U.S. Consumer business. And then the market took all of that and that has just -- it still blasted through. 
When we talk about inventories, it's not backroom warehouse stock. It's restocking the shelf itself, that's part of that. And I think that, that's going to be a gradual process as we go through the first half of the year."

This has also been a chance to rethink the assortment in the category. And so we've taken a look as part of this to -- it reduces the number of items in the store for their section.
