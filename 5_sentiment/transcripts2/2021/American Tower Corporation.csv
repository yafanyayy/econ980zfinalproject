We've posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.a",565,"Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We've posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the quarter and full year 2020. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide a strategic update on our long-term growth trajectory. 
And finally, Rob Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2020 results and 2021 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, our expectations regarding our pending Telxius transaction and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact.
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC.
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020.
During the quarter, our property revenue increased 10% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% to nearly $1.4 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively, to $936 million and $2.10. On an FX-neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 13.4%, 15.9% and 11.9%, respectively.
Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by roughly 35% to $365 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. The decrease included the impacts of approximately $181 million in impairment charges in the quarter across several markets as well as the nonrecurrence of certain income tax benefits in India from 2019. From a full year perspective, our property revenue increased 6.5% to nearly $8 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.7% to approximately $5.2 billion, and our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively, to nearly $3.8 billion and $8.49.
On an FX-neutral basis, full year growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 10.8%, 12.3% and 11.6%, respectively.
Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by about 10.4% to $1.7 billion, or $3.79 per diluted common share, again, impacted by the impairment charges in the fourth quarter and the nonrecurrence of certain income tax benefits in India from 2019. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. As you just saw from our posted results, we finished 2020 with another strong quarter and have solid momentum heading into 2021. Globally, the secular trends in mobile that we've leveraged to deliver sustainable, long",2127,"Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. As you just saw from our posted results, we finished 2020 with another strong quarter and have solid momentum heading into 2021. Globally, the secular trends in mobile that we've leveraged to deliver sustainable, long-term growth are firmly intact as advancing mobile technology modernizes economies, transforms the lives of billions of people and conexus during an unprecedented pandemic.
Our extensive communications real estate portfolio is well positioned to serve as the fundamental backbone of today and tomorrow's modern wireless networks and we're excited about our path forward. But before I get into our future expectations, I want to first briefly summarize our last 5 years of performance and highlight the key drivers of those results as a form of a backdrop for what we expect going forward.
Turning to Slide 6 of our presentation. You can see that from 2015 to 2020, and we generated an 11% CAGR for consolidated property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share. These results were supported by attractive organic tenant billings growth rates, which averaged 6% in the U.S. and 7% internationally. Additionally, over the last 5 years, we have meaningfully enhanced our global new build program creating a platform that enabled us to construct nearly 5,900 sites just this past year and almost 17,000 sites since the start of 2016. 
Our focus on new site construction, together with our proven disciplined M&A strategy has resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 new sites over the last 5 years, further lifting our returns and growth trajectory. Concurrently, we grew our annual common stock dividend by more than 150% from $1.81 per share in 2015 to $4.53 per share in 2020, adding another attractive element to our total return formula.
The consistency of our performance over these last 5 years speaks to the fact that our stand and deliver strategy is working. The 4 pillars of this strategy, operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, extending our platform and driving industry leadership have continued to pay dividends across our global asset base.
We firmly believe that the continued implementation of these strategic priorities will result in sustainable long-term growth generation, and that remains our focus. In other words, while we are obviously mindful of and realize the importance of our quarterly numbers, the way that we run the company is fundamentally designed to optimize returns over a much longer planning horizon. And we believe our results speak for themselves.
This philosophy is evidenced by, among other things, our strategic long-term contracts, such as the T-Mobile agreement that we signed in September. In the immediate term, that deal will result in some elevated churn. But over the longer term, we expect it to create a tremendous value for our stockholders, while helping to secure a significant share of industry leasing activity in our sites and supporting the deployment of 5G across the country.
Our recently announced Telxius transaction is another good example of our stand and deliver construct in action. Our financial strength, proven capital allocation strategy and objective of gaining scale in the most attractive markets globally enabled us to identify what we believe to be a unique opportunity for long-term value creation in Europe.
And overall, as we expand our global platform. As is typical with our investments, this transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. However, most of the accretion and shareholder value will be realized over time as we generate Lisa, construct additional sites to round out the portfolio and drive higher margins.
Additional future upside may come, we believe, from our platform expansion initiatives, particularly in markets like Germany, where we anticipate that edge computing will be important for carriers and enterprise accounts themselves as they seize the benefits of 5G. And the ability to be in a unique position to be able to provide a global platform of well over 200,000 sites in over 20 countries, pro forma Fortelus the global MNOS, hyperscalers, enterprise accounts and data center companies should drive additional value over time.
Our stand and deliver commitment also drives our focus on industry leadership, particularly in the area of ESG, including, among other things, our increasing use of renewable energy, reduction of our emissions and numerous human capital initiatives designed to ensure that we remain is not only a preferred employer, but also a positive driving force in our communities.
This was particularly relevant this past year as we enhanced our commitments to diversity throughout the company, committed funds to help counter Social & Justice and structural and equities and saw additional opportunities to make a positive impact, including initiatives to help bridge the digital divide through programs like our digital villages.
Our culture at American Tower is extremely important to me personally as well as the rest of our executive team. And while we clearly have more to do, I'm proud of the tremendous strides we have all made together over the last few years. Looking forward, we expect our continued execution of Stand and Deliver to result in similarly attractive long-term sustainable growth for American Tower and compelling total returns for our stockholders.
Moving to Slide 7. You can see that the U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth will continue to be a critical component of our long-term success. Having said that, as I just mentioned, we will have elevated levels of U.S. churn beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and particularly in 2022, which will result in average U.S. organic tenant billings growth rates of around 2% across the next 2 years.
This is due to the legacy Sprint network being substantially decommissioned by T-Mobile and the fact that, unlike our peers, we have been able to limit iden-related churn to date as a result of previous master lease agreements. Adjusted to exclude these cancellations, our expected U.S. organic tenant billings growth through 2022 would average around 5%.
As part of that growth, we expect our gross new business commencements to accelerate beyond 2020 levels given the deployment of new technology, new spectrum and new market entrants, which even more interesting for us, in line with our focus on long-term growth, is the organic trajectory beginning in 2023. As you can see in the slide, from 2023 through 2027, we expect organic tenant billings growth to accelerate to, on average, at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6% excluding the impacts of the remaining legacy Sprint churn.
Importantly, much of this growth is contractual, in part driven by escalators on existing leases which will continue to average more than 3% per year and in part represented by future of new business that we have locked in through contractual frameworks like our agreement with T-Mobile.
Said another way, the majority of our expected baseline future organic growth in the United States through 2027 is contractually guaranteed today. This is further supported by our expectations that churn in the U.S. will be lower than historical levels once the legacy Sprint leases fully roll off in 2024. The noncontractually guaranteed components of these projections are based on the assumption that annual wireless CapEx in the U.S. will be slightly higher than current levels through 2027 as 5G deployments take hold and as new spectrum like C-band is deployed. This, in many ways, mirrors what has occurred in the past with new technology rollouts where CapEx levels have risen with each new G. We continue to believe that the carriers have a mandate to deploy 5G as quickly as possible, given it is the most cost-effective way for them to address the tremendous growing levels of mobile data traffic, streaming across their networks.
As a result, we expect to see meaningful incremental densification and amendment activity for the foreseeable future driving strong growth. Importantly, we've not layered in any material assumptions around a potential new entrant outside of DISH, and we have assumed only modest contributions from edge computing and other platform expansion initiatives within these numbers.
We are working diligently to unearth additional meaningful opportunities that can drive further upside to our growth rates. Turning to Slide 8, we are also reiterating our aspirational goal of delivering average annual double-digit consolidated AFFO per share growth for the next 7 years including initial guidance of around 8.5% growth for 2021.
We expect the U.S. organic growth I just referenced to, to be an important component of our AFFO trajectory. In addition, similar to what we have seen in the past, our expectation is for international organic tenant billings growth rates to be at least 200 basis points higher than the U.S. over the long term, further enhancing our consolidated AFFO per share growth.
Many of our international markets are in earlier stages of technology development, have little to no fixed line penetration and require tremendous incremental investment in their wireless network infrastructure to support future densification.
The criticality of wireless in these locations has been further highlighted during the ongoing pandemic as have the limitations of current network infrastructure. As a result, we expect that as carriers ramp their network investments, our emerging market organic growth rates will continue to be very attractive.
Meanwhile, in more advanced markets like Germany, we are now seeing early stages of 5G build-outs, which we believe will result in a long pathway of attractive growth as well. Importantly, we expect organic growth in Germany to accelerate meaningfully over the next several years. Furthermore, we expect recent and future M&A, together with our accelerating new build program to drive additional value.
This includes our pending Celsius deal, several recently closed transactions in the United States as well as the nearly 5,900 sites we constructed in 2020 and the roughly 6,500 sites we expect to build in 2021. In fact, based upon the demand we are seeing for new sites across our international business, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new towers over the next 5 years with day 1 NOI yields continuing to be extremely attractive. And on the M&A side, we expect there to be numerous additional opportunities for us to deploy capital towards high-quality assets with attractive counterparties and favorable economics.
As in the past, we expect M&A to be a key piece of our future growth story. Enhancing operational efficiency, another pillar of stand and deliver will also be a key area for us as we seek to drive continued double-digit growth in consolidated AFFO per share. As we incrementally globalize the business, we are creating shared service centers, optimizing various back-office processes, sharpening our pencils on-site level services like energy provision, and focusing resources on further enhancing and improving our customers' experience with us, utilizing drone technology and our instant colo initiatives are examples of how we are both scaling more efficiently and increasing the value proposition for our customers. 
We remain laser-focused on driving margin improvement throughout the business, which should translate into continued high conversion rates of adjusted EBITDA to consolidated AFFO. Finally, we continue to believe that our leading investment-grade balance sheet is a key differentiator for the company and expect that it will be an important component in achieving double-digit consolidated AFFO per share growth.
Investment-grade debt markets remain extremely attractive from both a rate and access perspective. And we feel good about our ability to not only complete value additive refinancing transactions but also to find accretive M&A in the future. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and expect it to be an important element of our future success. In conclusion, we believe that we are exceptionally well positioned to extend our long track record of driving strong growth and attractive returns particularly at a point in time when mobile broadband connectivity globally has never been more critical.
We have tremendous visibility into our future baseline growth trajectory including having roughly $59 billion in contractually committed revenues, supported by long term, mutually beneficial, comprehensive master lease agreements with key tenants. We also expect to have some interesting opportunities to further enhance that baseline through platform expansion initiatives like edge computing, power as a service and other potential sources of upside.
Moreover, we believe that our unmatched geographic diversification of distributed sites has the potential to set us apart from the competition, particularly in the context of an increasingly global tenant base cross-border infrastructure deployments and an even more connected and digitally driven world. We firmly believe we have the right strategy the right macro tower oriented asset base and the right management team to move American tower forward into the 5G era and beyond. With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2020 results and the details of our 2021 outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are all doing well. As you can see from our press release and presentation, we had another solid year in finish 2020 on a high note, posting another strong quarter of performance across",3477,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are all doing well. As you can see from our press release and presentation, we had another solid year in finish 2020 on a high note, posting another strong quarter of performance across our global business. This included constructing a record number of high-return new sites, completing 2 sizable and accretive acquisitions in the U.S., strengthening our already strong balance sheet and achieving higher than previously expected consolidated AFFO per share growth.
Our mission-critical tower portfolio, ability to execute across our global footprint, disciplined, reliable and proven approach to capital allocation and strong balance sheet, all position us to achieve the long-term predictable growth that Tom referenced earlier.
As part of that growth path, we expect to have a strong year in 2021. But before I get into the details of our 2021 expectations, I'll spend a few minutes on our financial results for the quarter and the full year 2020. As you can see on Slide 10, we reached double-digit growth in property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO in the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Our fourth quarter consolidated property revenue of $2.1 billion grew on a reported basis by $191 million or 10% over the prior year period. And on an FX-neutral basis, by $256 million or 13.4%. We generated consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.4%, including 4% in the U.S. and 5.2% in our international markets, led by Africa at 9.4% in Latin America at more than 7%.
As expected, U.S. organic tenant billings growth pulled back a bit in Q4, due primarily to the flow-through impacts of slower activity levels earlier in the year. Meanwhile, in international markets, we completed the construction of approximately 2,900 new sites, which nearly doubled the previous American tower record set in Q3 of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA growth was 13% in the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins up by over 150 basis points year-over-year due to organic growth, cost controls and straight-line benefits. Finally, we translated that strong adjusted EBITDA growth to solid consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth of nearly 9% or about 12% on a currency-neutral basis.
On Slide 11, you can see that our full year consolidated property revenue growth was 6.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 4.8% and total tenant billings growth of 9.7%. In total, we outpaced our initial property revenue outlook on a currency-neutral basis by more than $130 million. Our organic tenant billings growth included 4.5% in volume growth from colocations and amendment activity, with another 3.3% generated through escalators. Churn was just under 3%, and there was a negative 10 basis point impact from other items.
For the year, we commenced over $19 million in gross new monthly business, with nearly $10 million of that in the U.S. Our U.S. and Canada property revenue grew nearly 8% supported by organic tenant billings growth of 4.6%, contributions to tenant billings from new assets of less than 1% and approximately $135 million in higher straight-line revenue.
With respect to organic tenant billings growth, volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed 3.5% to the full year growth rate, while pricing escalators contributed 3.2%. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.7% and a negative impact of roughly 30 basis points from other items. Our international property revenue grew by nearly 5% or by around 14.5% on a currency-neutral basis as meaningful network capital was again deployed globally by large multinational tenants. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% with colocation and amendment revenue-driving 6.5% growth, while escalators contributed nearly 3.6%. Other run rate items added 20 basis points, while churn concentrated in India was just over 5%.
Finally, the day 1 revenue associated with the more than 23,000 sites we've added through M&A in our newbuild programs over the last 2 years, contributed nearly 5% to our global tenant billings growth. This includes the impact of our nearly 5,900 new builds in 2020, which generated average day 1 NOI yields of over 12%. 
Moving to Slide 12. For the year, adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 64.1%, a year-over-year expansion of over 150 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by strong underlying revenue growth, net straight-line benefits and continuing cost efficiencies throughout the business. On an FX-neutral basis, we exceeded our initial 2020 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by around $150 million. These adjusted EBITDA results included continuing progress in fuel management, particularly in Africa where we reduced our diesel usage by more than 45 million liters in 2020. As of the end of the year, we had more than 7,000 sites with lithium-ion batteries and over 3,000 with solar. We also grew consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share by nearly 8% in 2020 as a result of our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA.
This growth was also supported by our disciplined capital market strategy. We avoided the credit market disruption caused by COVID-19 between March and May, while taking full advantage of improved conditions thereafter. In fact, despite closing over $9 billion in M&A since the start of 2019, we were able to reduce our cash interest expense by approximately $40 million, maintenance CapEx by more than $10 million and kept cash taxes flat 2020 versus 2019.
On a currency-neutral basis, these strategic efforts and effective management of our cost structure, facilitated consolidated AFFO per share growth of roughly 11.6%, exceeding our initial expectations for the year by more than $0.23 per share. Now let's take a look at our expectations for 2021. Before we dig into the numbers, I'd like to summarize a few of the key high level assumptions surrounding our projections. First, both in the U.S. and in our international markets, we expect gross new business additions to our recurring monthly run rate to be above 2020 levels.
This is due to a mix of contractually committed revenue growth particularly in the U.S. and continued solid demand for tower space internationally. Carriers are expected to deploy new technologies and new spectrum while densifying their networks to keep up with rapidly growing mobile data usage around the world.
Second, we expect churn to be somewhat elevated this year due to a combination of T-Mobile lease cancellations in the U.S., primarily in the fourth quarter and holdover churn in India. In the U.S., we expect that churn will be just over 3% for the full year, including 6.5% in Q4, specifically. This includes scheduled cancellations as part of our agreement with T-Mobile, some legacy Sprint and Clearwire churn outside of the MLA and normal course cancellations of around 2%. Of the roughly $375 million in total annualized legacy Sprint churn that we expect over the next 4 years, more than 50% or just under $200 million will hit our run rate in 2021, with the vast majority churning off October 1. 
Given this is an annualized number, we will incur a quarter of the impact in 2021, with 3 quarters of it coming in 2022. In India, we expect churn to be roughly 11% in 2021, which is down about 3% versus 2020, but still higher than historical levels. Similar to 2020, this churn is primarily being driven by holdover consolidation impacts in the effects of the AGR case.
We continue to work closely with the Indian wireless carriers as they plan for the future and are optimistic that churn rates in India will continue to trend down over the next several years. Finally, I would note that we have excluded the impacts of our pending Celsius transaction and its associated financings from our outlook per historical practice.
We continue to expect the deal to close in multiple tranches beginning late in the second quarter. And we'll plan to layer on the deal impacts into the future outlook update. As a reminder, we expect Celsius assets to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. Taking these assumptions into account, as you can see on Slide 13, we expect consolidated property revenue to grow by nearly 8% at the midpoint of our outlook, supported by solid overall levels of organic new business and contributions from new assets.
Our U.S. and Canada property revenue is expected to grow by 8%, with anticipated international property revenue growth of 7.5%, including an approximately 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. We expect organic new business to again be a critical component of our overall growth in 2021. And on a consolidated basis, our outlook assumes more than $23 million of gross new business monthly run rate added across our tower and DAS assets in 2021, up about 20% as compared to 2020.
Turning to Slide 14. In the U.S. and Canada, we are projecting organic tenant billings growth of around 3% as 5G deployments continue to gather steam and network densification efforts progress. On a gross basis, we expect monthly new business run rate added in 2021 to exceed what we added in 2020 by more than 15%. However, we will see elevated churn from T-Mobile beginning in Q4, and we will also see some carryover effects from slower activity levels in 2020, particularly earlier in the year.
As a result, our organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be lower than last year. I would note that these projections don't include significant contributions from DISH, nor do they assume material C-band deployments until quite late in the year. As we saw in the recently concluded C-band option, there is a huge premium being placed on mid-band spectrum by the carriers. And we continue to expect that the majority of mid-band deployments will be on macro tower sites.
We're enthusiastic about the potential impact of these deployments on our U.S. and Canada growth, particularly in 2022 and beyond. Moving on to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of around 7% for the year, broadly in line with what we saw in 2020. Demand trends remain solid with carriers focused on improving and extending 4G networks as mobile data usage accelerates. Additionally, we expect escalators across the region to be around 130 basis points higher than last year due primarily to certain contractual arrangements in Brazil on some of the tenant leases.
Partially offsetting these items is expected churn of nearly 3% in the region due primarily to a settlement agreement we reached with Brazil related to legacy Nextel leases and some TelefÃ³nica churn in Mexico in the second half of the year. On the inorganic side, we expect to further accelerate our new build program and anticipate constructing around 600 sites, a year-over-year increase of almost 50%.
Incorporating contributions from these new sites, we expect Latin America tenant buildings to grow by around 7.5% for the full year. Meanwhile, in Africa, 2021 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be more than 8%. We anticipate gross new business monthly run rate added to be up roughly 70% year-over-year with Nigeria leading the way in terms of higher activity levels.
Partially offsetting this are escalated that we anticipate will be around 70 basis points lower than last year, in churn of about 3% up about 140 basis points versus 2020. The escalators are largely a function of local CPI, while the slightly elevated churn primarily reflects some carrier consolidation in South Africa.
We also expect another year of significant new build activity in Africa with 1,300 new builds planned for 2021. In total, we expect to drive tenant billings growth of more than 13% in the region. In Europe, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% in 2021, up from 2.2% in 2020. The acceleration is being driven by the combination of higher levels of expected new business and slightly lower churn as carriers advance their network deployments.
We are starting to see some of the growth that drives our optimism around the healthiest assets in our existing European business. Germany's gross organic tenant billings growth in Q4 of 2020 was nearly 7% and is expected to continue at that level into 2021, with further accelerations anticipated in future years. Finally, in India, we expect organic tenant billings growth to be roughly flat in 2021, broadly similar to what we saw in 2020. While we believe the wireless industry consolidation process is essentially complete, there remains some uncertainty with respect to the exact path forward post AGR.
As a result, our outlook for 2021 incorporates the expectation that we will again see higher than historical levels of churn. In addition, while new monthly run rate added from new business is expected to be slightly up versus 2020 due to the activity being mostly in the second half of the year, it will not fully impact our organic growth in 2021.
As a result, although we expect churn to be 11%, down from nearly 14% in 2020, overall organic tenant billings growth is projected to be similar. Long term, we remain optimistic with respect to our India business. There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to bring networks across the country up to 4G standards, and our portfolio is well positioned to capture that activity.
From a structural perspective, we think there is a path to an eventual return to high typical organic tenant billings growth rates in the high single digits. What is less clear is the specific timing of that growth acceleration, which will depend on a number of factors in the marketplace.
As we learn more and as the trajectory becomes clear, we will plan to keep you all updated. Turning to Slide 15. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by almost $485 million or nearly 9.5%. This includes continued high margin flow-through of organic growth as well as the impacts of accretive M&A transactions completed in 2020, along with build-to-suit activity and a full year of our recent MLA agreement with T-Mobile.
In addition, we expect to target areas in our business where we can take additional efficiencies, including power and fuel, where we are continuing to invest in more efficient equipment and renewable energy solutions. Our cash SG&A expense as a percent of total property revenue is expected to be around 7.3%, down from just over 8% in 2020, and we anticipate further reductions in the future.
Finally, our adjusted EBITDA expectations include an estimated positive impact of around $27 million from the effects of FX translation. Moving to the next slide, we expect to convert our adjusted EBITDA growth into year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of around $322 million or 8.5%. This includes $358 million from FX-neutral cash adjusted EBITDA growth, benefits from lower cash interest costs due to the recent refinancing initiative, and about $23 million in favorable translational FX impacts.
Partially offsetting these items is a $62 million increase in FX-neutral cash taxes versus the prior year as well as a slight increase in total maintenance Capex. On a per share basis, we expect consolidated AFFO growth to be nearly 8.5% for the year, setting the stage for us to achieve double-digit per share growth if we drive some outperformance versus current expectations.
Moving on to Slide 17. Let's review our capital deployment in 2020 and our expectations for 2021. In 2020, we deployed about $2 billion for our dividend while spending roughly $1.1 billion on Capex, with more than 85% of that being discretionary. Part of that discretionary spend was to build nearly 5,900 sites throughout our global footprint, a new record for American Tower. We spent around $5.5 billion, including the assumption of debt, to acquire new assets and additional stakes in our Africa and India businesses from JV partners, and we also dedicated about $56 million to buybacks.
In total, we deployed nearly $9 billion in 2020, a record year for American Tower while staying within our leverage targets and simultaneously strengthening the balance sheet. We again expect to deploy capital in a consistent, balanced manner in 2021. This includes $1.4 billion committed to Capex, again, largely discretionary and about $2.3 billion allocated towards our dividend, assuming a growth rate of around 15% in subject to Board approval.
Included in our discretionary CapEx spend is the expected construction of 6,500 new sites worldwide, an increase of more than 600 sites compared to 2020. Day 1 NOI yields on these bills are expected to continue to average more than 10%. And new build CapEx remains as our highest return investment with solid anchor tenant credit quality. In addition, and as I'll talk more in a minute, we expect to close our pending Celsius acquisition this year for total consideration of about $9.4 billion.
Including this transaction, we expect that roughly 90% of our total capital deployment in 2021 will be an investment-grade rated geographies with investment-grade carriers. As you can see on the right side of the slide, our discipline to capital allocation strategy, coupled with solid operational execution and a strong balance sheet has enabled us to drive consistent reoccurring long-term growth in consolidated AFFO per share.
And we expect more of the same this year. In fact, in 2021, we expect our 2020 investments in new builds and M&A to generate around $0.15 in incremental consolidated AFFO per share. We continue to believe that both consolidated AFFO per share growth and attractive returns on invested capital are critical to our creation of long-term sustainable stockholder value.
Now turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our financing plans for the pending Celsius acquisition. As a reminder, this transaction is transformational for our European business as it delivers significant scale in key markets, is expected to drive some of the highest organic tenant billings growth rates available in the region.
And based on our analysis, represents the best portfolio of tower assets that has come to market in Europe. The total consideration will be approximately $9.4 billion, and we anticipate completing the purchase in 2021 through multiple closings. We expect the first closing to consist of a large portion of the European assets in late Q2, with the remaining assets in Europe and Latin America closing in late Q3.
Of course, this time line may shift as the regulatory process unfolds. As we communicated when we announced the deal, we plan to finance the transaction in a manner consistent with maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. We anticipate this will include bringing our net leverage, which stood at 5x at the end of 2020, up to the high 5x range temporarily. Importantly, we are committed to organically delevering back down to a level consistent with our stated financial policy of 3 to 5x net leverage over a multiyear period. On the debt funding front, we expect to utilize a combination of our recently upsized revolving credit facility and new euro-denominated term loans and plan to opportunistically consider long-term sources including senior unsecured notes.
The balance of the total consideration is expected to be funded with equity, which may include common stock issuances, mandatory convertible preferred instruments and/or private capital raised through the sale of minority stakes of our European subsidiary to one or more private investment partners.
On the private capital side, we are currently engaged in discussions with a select group of premier strategic investors who not only can provide capital but also have considerable experience in telecommunications infrastructure and in the European region specifically. We are encouraged by our progress on this front. And if terms are sufficiently attractive, are optimistic that we can complement a public equity issuance with a high-quality strategic private capital raise. 
As always, through this process, we remain disciplined and focused on minimizing dilution to our common stockholders, while optimizing our long-term value creation objectives. On Slide 19, and in summary, 2020 was a very strong resilient year for America Tower with solid organic growth, operational efficiencies, providing high conversion rates, record new build activity, accretive M&A and continued value creation for our shareholders.
Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term potential of our business. Our comprehensive portfolio is well positioned to capture meaningful lease-up as new spectrum assets and new network technologies are deployed globally. In the U.S., activity is ramping up, and we expect to continue to create significant value through the master lease agreements with key tenants.
We stand ready to quickly integrate the new Celsius assets this year and leverage our expanded European presence for significant future growth, which will complement our operations in other less mature markets. Taking into account continued strong tailwinds from secular growth trends in mobile, we expect to be able to deliver attractive, sustainable growth in revenues and cash flows for years to come while driving compelling total stockholder returns. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for questions."

First, you mentioned that you do expect that gross activity is likely to increase from here. One of your peers outlined a view that, that will begin in the second half of this year. I'm wondering if that's the same assumption you've embedded in your outlook. I'm also curious how sensitive your outlook is to that. I think at this point, you have an MLA with all of your major customers. And so perhaps the variability here is narrower.
And then just on churn, I think you suggested a non Sprint churn was going to be in the 2% range this year, which is a bit above trend. I'm wondering if there's anything we need to focus on. And then I believe T-Mobile has indicated they're going to be shutting down the Sprint CDMA network, I think, starting next year, is that captured in your churn assumptions as well?"

So I'll take that. This is Rob Smith. Thanks for the question. So with regards to our U.S. organic tenant billings growth as we roll into 2021, let me get a couple of the component drivers that will be factors, including the new business. So as you saw in the presentation, we expect to have organic tenant billings growth of around 3% for 2021. That's down from about 4.6% in 2020. There's a few factors driving that. The first one is that our monthly run rate new biz is anticipated to increase by about 15% year-over-year. So that's going to drive some growth there in our organic tenants billings growth. That obviously is being offset by a couple of factors. One is, as you mentioned, the Sprint churn. 
So we do expect to begin to see Sprint churn in Q3 of 2021. And as you saw in the presentation in some of our prepared remarks, we are expecting over the next 4 years to have about $375 million of annualized Sprint churn. The vast majority of that ends up coming in, in the beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 so we'll see churn beginning in the fourth quarter. That will represent about $200 million of annualized run rate that will begin to come off or come off into in Q4 of 2020.
That has a drag on organic and it's billings growth of almost 100 basis points. So that explains a big chunk of that step down between year-over-year. The next piece that I would highlight is the activity levels coming out of 2020. So everyone knows there was kind of a slowdown from T-Mobile and Sprint in 2020, begin in 2019 and way into 2020. That slowdown has flow through effect into 2021, which also impact our growth rates. And that is going to impact the beginning of the year, the first half of the year, more than the second half of the year. So that's probably consistent with what you may have heard from some other folks.
And then the final piece, this -- the size of our base is getting bigger, and that usually brings down growth by about 20 bps. So we have that as well. And then I would -- the final point I would make on the organic tenant billings growth is our organic tenant billings growth is not that sensitive to the timing of activity and even other network decommissioning as it's mostly made up of contracts that have minimum levels of activity and predefined churn reductions and those sorts of things.
So there's not a lot of variability in our numbers from that perspective. And then in terms of the spring, I guess I addressed the Sprint to our numbers. So I think that probably addresses that part of your question, Brett?"

No. I think the way you framed it up is correct. So we expect churn -- normal churn to be within that 1% to 2% range, pretty consistent, nothing abnormal there.

So we expect churn -- normal churn to be within that 1% to 2% range, pretty consistent, nothing abnormal there. And then the Sprint churn, again, that begins in Q4, we'll have about 100 basis point hit. So when you think about that, all in, our annual churn would be in the range of 3%, a little bit above what our normal ranges. And again, as you see the quarters unfold in 2021, the fourth quarter will be where you'll see the kind of that big bump up in the churn numbers.
And then, of course, that will take 1/4 of that in 2021. And then there'll be flow through effects from that churn into 2022, where we get 3 quarters of that churn in 2022. And that, of course, will have a flow-through negative impact on the 2020 system growth numbers. But -- and gross new business is accelerating as we head into 2021, and we expect that to continue into 2022. It's really the churn that will partially or fully offset that in 2021 or 2022."

With regards to your first comment, I mean, there are no new MLAs that -- I mean, we already have MLAs in place with the major carriers. So there's nothing else that's driving that, which I think is what your question was.
The most significant MLA that we've recently amended clearly with T-Mobile. And so that's what's really impacting, if you will. And as I mentioned, over 2/3 of over the planning period that we're talking about, 2/3 of our growth rates are locked in. And so we have a tremendous visibility in terms of what that's going to look like. And as I mentioned, we have $59 billion or $60 billion of already contractually committed revenue on the books.
So that gives us, I think, some really good comfort in terms of what we would expect. On top of that, we will also have the large Celsius transaction that will kick in, as Rod said, throughout the year. And so we'll have that benefit continuing forward, which kind of gets into your second question. We've looked at, as I mentioned in my comments, over the last 5 years, we're talking about double-digit growth rates in terms of AFFO per share.
I'm compensated candidly on the bulk on AFFO per share growth as well as return on invested capital. So those are 2 critical benchmarks for myself and my team. So we obviously spend a lot of time working through all of the elements of those. In 2022, yes, there is going to be the trough of the T-Mobile churn that we're going to see. We know what it is. We're working on opportunities now to be able to mitigate a lot of that as we go into 2022. We put out an initial guide for 2021 at that 8.5% level.
We are all hoping that we're going to be able to improve on that for 2021, particularly as we bring on kind of the Celsius transaction. And then we're working through what 2022 will look like. But clearly, are committed to driving that double-digit AFFO per share growth over the long period of time, as we've done in the past.
And so we've had historically consolidations going on. As you know, we've had consolidation churn in India over the past. No doubt that the T-Mobile-Sprint churn is a large item for us that we need to address. But our teams are working on it diligently right now. And we're trying to work through that. And -- but clearly, we are committed to driving that double-digit kind of growth."

As Rod said and I alluded to as well, we continue to remain really positive on the market overall. It's a work in progress, as you well know. We're looking at growth -- gross growth in the market of double digit. The challenge is the churn, and it's coming down on a year-over-year basis, and we will -- it will continue to come down. And that's what we need to be working on with our carriers, particularly Vodafone in the region, and we are working on that as we speak.
And so over the longer period of time, I would expect that churn to be coming down and for us to be really be able to start to drive the positive net organic growth. I mean, if you take a look at our overall international markets, we're growing 7% to 9% in Latin America and Africa, Europe, as I mentioned before with brick, we really see some nice growth, I think, that we're going to be experiencing there. So it is India. It is that focus on that particular market that we need to drive that will bring up the overall, clearly, the growth rate in the -- in an international space. And there are a number of things that have to happen in the marketplace, which we see happening they just don't happen very quickly.
Clearly, the government is committed to digital India, to their digital India program. I think the pandemic has made that even more obvious because so many Indians are looking for telehealth services, and they need that broadband connection. So everything that we're hearing, we're seeing is really giving me even more and more comfort. That the government is going to be supporting the carriers to really being able to densify the overall network.
And we're seeing that. We're seeing it in the build programs. Clearly, we're seeing that from all of the 3 major carriers in the marketplace. We're starting to see price increases in the market, which I think is really positive. We're also seeing our customers and particularly, Vodafone, looking to identify different areas to be able to infuse capital.
I also just saw yesterday from an AGR perspective at the government is now relooking at some of the new calculations that the carriers were being opposed on that they are going to have to pay over the next 10 years or so. So again, I think that's just indicative of the fact that the government very much wants -- each and every one of the carriers to survive and to participate to their own digitization that's going on within the marketplace. But we got more work to do.
We've got to work through the contracts that we have in place, particularly with Vodafone to try to nip some of that churn. But as I said, we're seeing the growth in the marketplace, which I think is what we've always seen is that opportunity. And so now we need to work on that the churn, which is exactly what we're doing."

So now it's at 6%. And I guess the question then becomes 2 questions. One, can you disaggregate that 6% growth into organic growth inflation-based escalators and new builds relative to the U.S.? And then can you disaggregate it regionally with respect to which regions are going to be driving more than six? And I guess your answer to Simon's question just now, maybe India is on the lower end of that six, if that calculation is correct."

David, well, thanks for that question. Let me take a -- I'll start it, and then I'm sure Rod and Igor or might be able to fill in some of the pieces. But as I talked about it, I mean you're right.

Let me take a -- I'll start it, and then I'm sure Rod and Igor or might be able to fill in some of the pieces. But as I talked about it, I mean you're right. We talked about kind of a 6% to 8% kind of growth range on a consolidated basis, right? 
If you go back a number of years. Now we are twice the size of business that we were back then. So growth on a base of that size does get to be a little bit more challenging. But if you even take a look at the numbers that I laid out for the U.S., this is just organic, right? And so it's not -- it does not include the -- our build-to-suit programs. In the United States, the big item there is the Sprint churn. And so that's why we kind of laid it out, looking at the next couple of years.
And then even layering in on top of, okay, what would that growth look like perhaps without that Sprint churn. And that's where it goes next couple of years being on average in the United States organically a couple percent but being up in that 5% range to the extent that we did not have it. And then you go out longer term, '23 to '27 in the United States, where it would be greater or equal to 5% and then without a greater equal to 6%. So it's kind of getting back.
And particularly, if you then weigh in the fact that the business is so much bigger, it's getting back to those ranges. And we're looking at some of that growth coming from some of our platform extension initiatives, but not in any significant way. I mean, it's largely from pure organic growth coming from our contractually committed master lease agreements that we have with our customers.
On the international side, we didn't necessarily come out with kind of long-term growth projections for them other than saying that we would expect it to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than what we're seeing in the United States. So given that, you would look at the 23% to 27% kind of average up in that 7%, 8% normalized without the kind of -- without the impact of the churn in the United States.
So it's really rather consistent with some of those growth rates that we laid out several years ago. And as I said that we do have a much bigger base of business. What's also exciting, though, is on the build-to-suit program that's driving tens of millions of dollars of new revenue for us each and every year.
We do have and I do expect, as I mentioned, kind of sights on adding 40,000 to 50,000 new build-to-suits over the next 5 years. We set records kind of every month, every year in terms of the building of these double-digit NOI. So it's really good return of capital for us and with good tenants. So it really provides upside to our overall growth rate that we expect going forward.
With the Telxius deal and the heavier European presence, we're getting a little bit more of a presence in even the developed markets. And I would expect, as I mentioned, I think it was to Rick, up 6% kind of growth rates are kind of being expected from my perspective in Germany.
And I think that there's really a lot of opportunities there. So again, just kind of stepping back, I don't think they're inconsistent with what we've said in the past. We are a bigger business. We did -- we do have the big Sprint churn event, which will impact us over the next couple of years, which is to no one's surprise, kicking in really the fourth quarter here. We talked about that right out of the gate with a up being churn in that kind of 4 percentage range, if you will, of our business. And it really did land on that. And I think we've been able to put in place a long-term contract with T-Mobile who are really in a very good position from a spectrum perspective and a build perspective, and I think we're going to be very aggressive. And so given the kind of after lease agreement we have in place with them, I'm really excited about the kind of the strategic relationship that we have with them to be able to explore new stuff and new areas of business so kind of long rambling answer for your question, but I think it's pretty consistent."

So I think I'll start by just reminding everyone, we ended the year with leverage at about 5x. That is at the top of our stated financial policy of 3 to 5x when it comes to Celsius and financing, the Celsius acquisition, of course, we expect to do that in a manner that's consistent with maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. That's always been important unless it continues to be very important to us. And we've been engaged in a variety of fronts here since we announced that deal in terms of preparing some financing.
The first thing I would note is we do have the committed bridge led by Bank of America, and we've gone further and syndicated that. So we have that in place as a backstop. You've also seen us in the in the debt market here in terms of the bank facilities, we upsized a couple of our revolvers. We also entered into a new term loan that's euro denominated.
That's about $1.5 -- or $1.9 billion dollar value. So we've got increased liquidity from that perspective. We did end 2022 at about $4.5 billion or almost $1.9 billion of liquidity, and these are additive to that, to prepare for the closing. One thing that we are comfortable with doing. We've been working with the rating agencies. We've been doing a lot of internal analysis, and we're comfortable increasing our leverage to the high 5x as and when we close the Celsius deal, and then we'll be committing to delevering back into within our financial policies over a couple of year time period.
So you will see us with higher leverage probably for an extended time period. And I'll let you do the math gold in terms of what that might mean in terms of how much we'll raise from debt to actually execute on the Celsius transaction. The balance of the purchase price that will remain, we'll look at a number of different equity sources. We're looking at public equity.
We're looking at mandatory converts, and we're also looking at private capital. And we're doing a lot of different analysis. Around that, it will make the best decisions for our shareholders in terms of maximizing total shareholder return, maximizing AFFO per share growth and also looking to help make sure that we have a really strong balance sheet as we go into the future, so we can continue to grow. 
So when you think about that, one of the things we've done is we've looked very hard at raising private capital. We've done a lot of work there. We're continuing to be engaged with just a small number of very large premier investors around the world, and we maintain a high level of confidence there that, that could be a very attractive vehicle for our shareholders. So we're continuing to explore that. And we'll make the decisions kind of along the way. And I would say when you think about private capital, we are in our analysis and the way we're thinking about it, we would be selling minority stakes in our European business.
It's not really related to the Telxius transaction specifically. It's the entire European business that we would look to finance potentially by adding some private capital in there. And in terms of the mix, how much private capital versus how much public equity, will be making those decisions here over the coming weeks and months as we kind of work through the analysis and get closer to closing. Did that hit all your points, Colby?"

Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I'll quickly summarize our financial results for the quarter and full year 2020. Next, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide a strategic update on our long-term growth trajectory. And finally, Rod Smith, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, will discuss our 2020 results and 2021 outlook. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. 
Before I begin, I'll remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2021 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance; our expectations regarding the impacts of COVID-19, our expectations regarding the impacts of the AGR decision in India, our expectations regarding our pending Telxius transaction and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. 
You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2020, and in other filings we make with the SEC. 
We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. 
During the quarter, our property revenue increased 10% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 13% to nearly $1.4 billion. And our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively, to $936 million and $2.10. On an FX-neutral basis, growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 13.4%, 15.9% and 11.9%, respectively. 
Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by roughly 35% to $365 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. The decrease included the impacts of approximately $181 million in impairment charges in the quarter across several markets as well as the nonrecurrence of certain income tax benefits in India from 2019. From a full year perspective, our property revenue increased 6.5% to nearly $8 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.7% to approximately $5.2 billion, and our consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share increased by 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively, to nearly $3.8 billion and $8.49. 
On an FX-neutral basis, full year growth rates for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share would have been 10.8%, 12.3% and 11.6%, respectively. 
Finally, net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders decreased by about 10.4% to $1.7 billion, or $3.79 per diluted common share, again, impacted by the impairment charges in the fourth quarter and the nonrecurrence of certain income tax benefits to India from 2019. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. As you just saw from our posted results, we finished 2020 with another strong quarter and have solid momentum heading into 2021. Globally, the secular trends in mobile that we've leveraged to deliver sustainable, long",2126,"Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. As you just saw from our posted results, we finished 2020 with another strong quarter and have solid momentum heading into 2021. Globally, the secular trends in mobile that we've leveraged to deliver sustainable, long-term growth are firmly intact as advancing mobile technology modernizes economies, transforms the lives of billions of people and connects us during an unprecedented pandemic. 
Our extensive communications real estate portfolio is well positioned to serve as the fundamental backbone of today and tomorrow's modern wireless networks and we're excited about our path forward. But before I get into our future expectations, I want to first briefly summarize our last 5 years of performance and highlight the key drivers of those results. As a form of a backdrop for what we expect going forward. 
Turning to Slide 6 of our presentation. You can see that from 2015 to 2020, we generated an 11% CAGR for consolidated property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO per share. These results were supported by attractive organic tenant billings growth rates, which averaged 6% in the U.S. and 7% internationally. Additionally, over the last 5 years, we have meaningfully enhanced our global new build program creating a platform that enabled us to construct nearly 5,900 sites just this past year and almost 17,000 sites since the start of 2016.  
Our focus on new site construction, together with our proven disciplined M&A strategy has resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 new sites over the last 5 years, further lifting our returns and growth trajectory. Concurrently, we grew our annual common stock dividend by more than 150% from $1.81 per share in 2015 to $4.53 per share in 2020, adding another attractive element to our total return formula. 
The consistency of our performance over these last 5 years speaks to the fact that our Stand and Deliver strategy is working. The 4 pillars of this strategy, operational efficiency, growing our assets and capabilities, extending our platform and driving industry leadership have continued to pay dividends across our global asset base. 
We firmly believe that the continued implementation of these strategic priorities will result in sustainable long-term growth generation, and that remains our focus. In other words, while we are obviously mindful of and realize the importance of our quarterly numbers, the way that we run the company is fundamentally designed to optimize returns over a much longer planning horizon. And we believe our results speak for themselves. 
This philosophy is evidenced by, among other things, our strategic long-term contracts, such as the T-Mobile agreement that we signed in September. In the immediate term, that deal will result in some elevated churn. But over the longer term, we expect it to create tremendous value for our stockholders, while helping to secure a significant share of industry leasing activity in our sites and supporting the deployment of 5G across the country. 
Our recently announced Telxius transaction is another good example of our Stand and Deliver construct in action. Our financial strength, proven capital allocation strategy and objective of gaining scale in the most attractive markets globally enabled us to identify what we believe to be a unique opportunity for long-term value creation in Europe. And overall, as we expand our global platform. As is typical with our investments, this transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. However, most of the accretion and shareholder value will be realized over time as we generate lease-up, construct additional sites to round out the portfolio and drive higher margins. 
Additional future upside may come, we believe, from our platform expansion initiatives, particularly in markets like Germany, where we anticipate that edge computing will be important for carriers and enterprise accounts themselves as they seize the benefits of 5G. And the ability to be in a unique position to be able to provide a global platform of well over 200,000 sites in over 20 countries, pro forma for Telxius the global MNOs, hyperscalers, enterprise accounts and data center companies should drive additional value over time. 
Our Stand and Deliver commitment also drives our focus on industry leadership, particularly in the area of ESG, including, among other things, our increasing use of renewable energy, reduction of our emissions and numerous human capital initiatives designed to ensure that we remain as not only a preferred employer, but also a positive driving force in our communities. 
This was particularly relevant this past year as we enhanced our commitments to diversity throughout the company, committed funds to help counter social and justice and structural and equities and saw additional opportunities to make a positive impact, including initiatives to help bridge the digital divide through programs like our digital Village. 
Our culture at American Tower is extremely important to me personally as well as the rest of our executive team. And while we clearly have more to do, I'm proud of the tremendous strides we have all made together over the last few years. Looking forward, we expect our continued execution of Stand and Deliver to result in similarly attractive long-term sustainable growth for American Tower and compelling total returns for our stockholders. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can see that the U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth will continue to be a critical component of our long-term success. Having said that, as I just mentioned, we will have elevated levels of U.S. churn beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and particularly in 2022, which will result in average U.S. organic tenant billings growth rates of around 2% across the next few years. 
This is due to the legacy Sprint network being substantially decommissioned by T-Mobile and the fact that, unlike our peers, we have been able to limit iDEN-related churn to date as a result of previous master lease agreements. Adjusted to exclude these cancellations, our expected U.S. organic tenant billings growth through 2022 would average around 5%. 
As part of that growth, we expect our gross new business commencements to accelerate beyond 2020 levels given the deployment of new technology, new spectrum and new market entrants. What's even more interesting for us, in line with our focus on long-term growth, is the organic trajectory beginning in 2023. As you can see in the slide, from 2023 through 2027, we expect organic tenant billings growth to accelerate to, on average, at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6% excluding the impacts of the remaining legacy Sprint churn. 
Importantly, much of this growth is contractual, in part driven by escalators on existing leases which will continue to average more than 3% per year and in part represented by future of new business that we have locked in through contractual frameworks like our agreement with T-Mobile. 
Said another way, the majority of our expected baseline future organic growth in the United States through 2027 is contractually guaranteed today. This is further supported by our expectations that churn in the U.S. will be lower than historical levels once the legacy Sprint leases fully roll off in 2024. The noncontractually guaranteed components of these projections are based on the assumption that annual wireless CapEx in the U.S. will be slightly higher than current levels through 2027 as 5G deployments take hold and this new spectrum like C-band is deployed. 
This, in many ways, mirrors what has occurred in the past with new technology rollouts where CapEx levels have risen with each new G. We continue to believe that the carriers have a mandate to deploy 5G as quickly as possible, given it is the most cost-effective way for them to address the tremendous growing levels of mobile data traffic, streaming across their networks. 
As a result, we expect to see meaningful incremental densification and amendment activity for the foreseeable future driving strong growth. Importantly, we've not layered in any material assumptions around a potential new entrant outside of DISH, and we have assumed only modest contributions from edge computing and other platform expansion initiatives within these numbers. We are working diligently to unearth additional meaningful opportunities that can drive further upside to our growth rates. 
Turning to Slide 8. we are also reiterating our aspirational goal of delivering average annual double-digit consolidated AFFO per share growth for the next 7 years including initial guidance of around 8.5% growth for 2021. We expect the U.S. organic growth, I just referenced to, to be an important component of our AFFO trajectory. In addition, similar to what we have seen in the past, our expectation is for international organic tenant billings growth rates to be at least 200 basis points higher than the U.S. over the long term, further enhancing our consolidated AFFO per share growth. 
Many of our international markets are in earlier stages of technology development, have little to no fixed line penetration and require tremendous incremental investment in their wireless network infrastructure to support future densification. The criticality of wireless in these locations has been further highlighted during the ongoing pandemic as have the limitations of current network infrastructure. As a result, we expect that as carriers ramp their network investments, our emerging market organic growth rates will continue to be very attractive. 
Meanwhile, in more advanced markets like Germany, we are now seeing early stages of 5G build-outs, which we believe will result in a long pathway of attractive growth as well. Importantly, we expect organic growth in Germany to accelerate meaningfully over the next several years. Furthermore, we expect recent and future M&A, together with our accelerating new build program to drive additional value. 
This includes our pending Telxius deal, several recently closed transactions in the States as well as the nearly 5,900 sites we constructed in 2020 and the roughly 6,500 sites we expect to build in 2021. In fact, based upon the demand we are seeing for new sites across our international business, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new towers over the next 5 years with day 1 NOI yields continuing to be extremely attractive. 
And on the M&A side, we expect there to be numerous additional opportunities for us to deploy capital towards high-quality assets with attractive counterparties and favorable economics. As in the past, we expect M&A to be a key piece of our future growth story. 
Enhancing operational efficiency, another pillar of Stand and Deliver will also be a key area for us as we seek to drive continued double-digit growth in consolidated AFFO per share. As we incrementally globalize the business, we are creating shared service centers, optimizing various back-office processes, sharpening our pencils on-site level services like energy provision, and focusing resources on further enhancing and improving our customers' experience with us, utilizing drone technology and our instant Colo initiatives are examples of how we are both scaling more efficiently and increasing the value proposition for our customers.  
We remain laser-focused on driving margin improvement throughout the business, which should translate into continued high conversion rates of adjusted EBITDA to consolidated AFFO. Finally, we continue to believe that our leading investment-grade balance sheet is a key differentiator for the company and expect that it will be an important component in achieving double-digit consolidated AFFO per share growth. 
Investment-grade debt markets remain extremely attractive from both a rate and access perspective. And we feel good about our ability to not only complete value additive refinancing transactions but also to find accretive M&A in the future. We remain fully committed to our investment-grade credit rating and expect it to be an important element of our future success. 
In conclusion, we believe that we are exceptionally well positioned to extend our long track record of driving strong growth and attractive returns particularly at a point in time when mobile broadband connectivity globally has never been more critical. 
We have tremendous visibility into our future baseline growth trajectory including having roughly $59 billion in contractually committed revenues, supported by long term, mutually beneficial, comprehensive master lease agreements with key tenants. We also expect to have some interesting opportunities to further enhance that baseline through platform expansion initiatives like edge computing, power as a service and other potential sources of upside. 
Moreover, we believe that our unmatched geographic diversification of distributed sites has the potential to set us apart from the competition, particularly in the context of an increasingly global tenant base, cross-border infrastructure deployments and an even more connected and digitally driven world. We firmly believe we have the right strategy the right macro tower oriented asset base and the right management team to move American Tower forward into the 5G era and beyond. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our 2020 results and the details of our 2021 outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are all doing well. As you can see from our press release and presentation, we had another solid year and finish 2020 on a high note, posting another strong quarter of performance across our global business. This included constructing a record number of high-return new sites. Completing 2 sizable and accretive acquisitions in the U.S., strengthening our already strong balance sheet and achieving higher than previously expected consolidated AFFO per share growth. 
Our mission-critical tower portfolio, ability to execute across our global footprint, disciplined, reliable and proven approach to capital allocation and strong balance sheet, all position us to achieve the long-term predictable growth that Tom referenced earlier. As part of that growth path, we expect to have a strong year in 2021. But before I get into the details of our 2021 expectations, I'll spend a few minutes on our financial results for the quarter and the full year 2020. 
As you can see on Slide 10, we reached double-digit growth in property revenue, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO in the fourth quarter on an FX-neutral basis. Our fourth quarter consolidated property revenue of $2.1 billion grew on a reported basis by $191 million or 10% over the prior year period. And on an FX-neutral basis, by $256 million or 13.4%. We generated consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 4.4%, including 4% in the U.S. and 5.2% in our international markets, led by Africa at 9.4% in Latin America at more than 7%. 
As expected, U.S. organic tenant billings growth pulled back a bit in Q4. due primarily to the flow-through impacts of slower activity levels earlier in the year. Meanwhile, in international markets, we completed the construction of approximately 2,900 new sites, which nearly doubled the previous American Tower record set in Q3 of 2020. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was 13% in the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins up by over 150 basis points year-over-year due to organic growth, cost controls and straight-line benefits. Finally, we translated that strong adjusted EBITDA growth to solid consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth of nearly 9% or about 12% on a currency-neutral basis. 
On Slide 11, you can see that our full year consolidated property revenue growth was 6.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 4.8% and total tenant billings growth of 9.7%. In total, we outpaced our initial property revenue outlook on a currency-neutral basis by more than $130 million. Our organic tenant billings growth included 4.5% in volume growth from colocations and amendment activity, with another 3.3% generated through escalators. Churn was just under 3%, and there was a negative 10 basis point impact from other items. 
For the year, we commenced over $19 million in gross new monthly business, with nearly $10 million of that in the U.S. Our U.S. and Canada property revenue grew nearly 8% supported by organic tenant billings growth of 4.6%, contributions to tenant billings from new assets of less than 1% and approximately $135 million in higher straight-line revenue. 
With respect to organic tenant billings growth, volume growth from colocations and amendments contributed 3.5% to the full year growth rate, while pricing escalators contributed 3.2%. This was partially offset by churn of about 1.7% and a negative impact of roughly 30 basis points from other items. 
Our international property revenue grew by nearly 5% or by around 14.5% on a currency-neutral basis as meaningful network capital was again deployed globally by large multinational tenants. International organic tenant billings growth was 5.1% with colocation and amendment revenue-driving 6.5% growth, while escalators contributed nearly 3.6%. Other run rate items added 20 basis points, while churn concentrated in India was just over 5%. 
Finally, the day 1 revenue associated with the more than 23,000 sites we've added through M&A in our new build programs over the last 2 years, contributed nearly 5% to our global tenant billings growth. This includes the impact of our nearly 5,900 new builds in 2020, which generated average day 1 NOI yields of over 12%.  
Moving to Slide 12. For the year, adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly 9%, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to 64.1%, a year-over-year expansion of over 150 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by strong underlying revenue growth, net straight-line benefits and continuing cost efficiencies throughout the business. 
On an FX-neutral basis, we exceeded our initial 2020 outlook for adjusted EBITDA by around $150 million. These adjusted EBITDA results included continuing progress in fuel management, particularly in Africa where we reduced our diesel usage by more than 45 million liters in 2020. As of the end of the year, we had more than 7,000 sites with lithium-ion batteries and over 3,000 with solar. We also grew consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share by nearly 8% in 2020 as a result of our previously discussed growth in cash adjusted EBITDA. 
This growth was also supported by our disciplined capital market strategy. We avoided the credit market disruption caused by COVID-19 between March and May, while taking full advantage of improved conditions thereafter. In fact, despite closing over $9 billion in M&A since the start of 2019, we were able to reduce our cash interest expense by approximately $40 million, maintenance CapEx by more than $10 million and kept cash taxes flat 2020 versus 2019. 
On a currency-neutral basis, these strategic efforts and effective management of our cost structure, facilitated consolidated AFFO per share growth of roughly 11.6%, exceeding our initial expectations for the year by more than $0.23 per share. 
Now let's take a look at our expectations for 2021. Before we dig into the numbers, I'd like to summarize a few of the key high level assumptions surrounding our projections. First, both in the U.S. and in our international markets, we expect gross new business additions to our recurring monthly run rate to be above 2020 levels. 
This is due to a mix of contractually committed revenue growth particularly in the U.S. and continued solid demand for tower space internationally. Carriers are expected to deploy new technologies and new spectrum while densifying their networks to keep up with rapidly growing mobile data usage around the world. 
Second, we expect churn to be somewhat elevated this year due to a combination of T-Mobile lease cancellations in the U.S., primarily in the fourth quarter and holdover churn in India. In the U.S., we expect that churn will be just over 3% for the full year, including 6.5% in Q4, specifically. 
This includes scheduled cancellations as part of our agreement with T-Mobile, some legacy Sprint and Clearwire churn outside of the MLA and normal course cancellations of around 2%. Of the roughly $375 million in total annualized legacy Sprint churn that we expect over the next 4 years, more than 50% or just under $200 million we'll hit our run rate in 2021, with the vast majority churning off October 1.  
Given this is an annualized number, we will incur 1/4 of the impact in 2021, with 3/4 of it coming in 2022. In India, we expect churn to be roughly 11% in 2021, which is down about 3% versus 2020, but still higher than historical levels. Similar to 2020, this churn is primarily being driven by holdover consolidation impacts in the effects of the AGR case. 
We continue to work closely with the Indian wireless carriers as they plan for the future and are optimistic that churn rates in India will continue to trend down over the next several years. Finally, I would note that we have excluded the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financings from our outlook per historical practice. 
We continue to expect the deal to close in multiple tranches beginning late in the second quarter. And we'll plan to layer on the deal impacts into the future outlook update. As a reminder, we expect Telxius assets to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share. 
Taking these assumptions into account, as you can see on Slide 13, we expect consolidated property revenue to grow by nearly 8% at the midpoint of our outlook, supported by solid overall levels of organic new business and contributions from new assets. 
Our U.S. and Canada property revenue is expected to grow by 8%, with anticipated international property revenue growth of 7.5%, including an approximately 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation. We expect organic new business to again be a critical component of our overall growth in 2021. And on a consolidated basis, our outlook assumes more than $23 million of gross new business monthly run rate added across our tower and DAS assets in 2021, up about 20% as compared to 2020. 
Turning to Slide 14. In the U.S. and Canada, we are projecting organic tenant billings growth of around 3% as 5G deployments continue to gather steam and network densification efforts progress. On a gross basis, we expect monthly new business run rate added in 2021 to exceed what we added in 2020 by more than 15%. However, we will see elevated churn from T-Mobile beginning in Q4, and we will also see some carryover effects from slower activity levels in 2020, particularly earlier in the year. 
As a result, our organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be lower than last year. I would note that these projections don't include significant contributions from DISH, nor do they assume material C-band deployments until quite late in the year. As we saw in the recently concluded C-band auction, there is a huge premium being placed on mid-band spectrum by the carriers. And we continue to expect that the majority of mid-band deployments will be on macro tower sites. We're enthusiastic about the potential impact of these deployments on our U.S. and Canada growth, particularly in 2022 and beyond. 
Moving on to Latin America. We expect organic tenant billings growth of around 7% for the year, broadly in line with what we saw in 2020. Demand trends remain solid with carriers focused on improving and extending 4G networks as mobile data usage accelerates. Additionally, we expect escalators across the region to be around 130 basis points higher than last year due primarily to certain contractual arrangements in Brazil on some of the tenant leases. 
Partially offsetting these items is expected churn of nearly 3% in the region. Due primarily to a settlement agreement we reached with Brazil related to legacy Nextel leases and some Telefónica churn in Mexico in the second half of the year. On the inorganic side, we expect to further accelerate our new build program and anticipate constructing around 600 sites, a year-over-year increase of almost 50%. 
Incorporating contributions from these new sites, we expect Latin America tenant billings to grow by around 7.5% for the full year. Meanwhile, in Africa, 2021 organic tenant billings growth is expected to be more than 8%. We anticipate gross new business monthly run rate added to be up roughly 70% year-over-year with Nigeria leading the way in terms of higher activity levels. 
Partially offsetting this are escalators that we anticipate will be around 70 basis points lower than last year, and churn of about 3%  up about 140 basis points versus 2020. The escalators are largely a function of local CPI, while the slightly elevated churn primarily reflects some carrier consolidation in South Africa. We also expect another year of significant new build activity in Africa with 1,300 new builds planned for 2021. In total, we expect to drive tenant billings growth of more than 13% in the region. 
In Europe, we expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% in 2021, up from 2.2% in 2020. The acceleration is being driven by the combination of higher levels of expected new business and slightly lower churn as carriers advance their network deployments. 
We are starting to see some of the growth that drives our optimism around the Telxius assets in our existing European business. Germany's gross organic tenant billings growth in Q4 of 2020 was nearly 7% and is expected to continue at that level into 2021, with further accelerations anticipated in future years. 
Finally, in India, we expect organic tenant billings growth to be roughly flat in 2021, broadly similar to what we saw in 2020. While we believe the wireless industry consolidation process is essentially complete, there remains some uncertainty with respect to the exact path forward post-AGR. 
As a result, our outlook for 2021 incorporates the expectation that we will again see higher than historical levels of churn. In addition, while new monthly run rate added from new business is expected to be slightly up versus 2020 due to the activity being mostly in the second half of the year, it will not fully impact our organic growth in 2021. 
As a result, although we expect churn to be 11%, down from nearly 14% in 2020, overall organic tenant billings growth is projected to be similar. Long term, we remain optimistic with respect to our India business. There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to bring networks across the country up to 4G standards, and our portfolio is well positioned to capture that activity. 
From a structural perspective, we think there is a path to an eventual return to high typical organic tenant billings growth rates in the high single digits. What is less clear is the specific timing of that growth acceleration, which will depend on a number of factors in the marketplace. As we learn more and as the trajectory becomes clear, we will plan to keep you all updated. 
Turning to Slide 15. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by almost $485 million or nearly 9.5%. This includes continued high margin flow-through of organic growth as well as the impacts of accretive M&A transactions completed in 2020, along with build-to-suit activity and a full year of our recent MLA agreement with T-Mobile. 
In addition, we expect to target areas in our business where we can take additional efficiencies, including power and fuel, where we are continuing to invest in more efficient equipment and renewable energy solutions. Our cash SG&A expense as a percent of total property revenue is expected to be around 7.3%, down from just over 8% in 2020, and we anticipate further reductions in the future. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA expectations include an estimated positive impact of around $27 million from the effects of FX translation. 
Moving to the next slide, we expect to convert our adjusted EBITDA growth into year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of around $322 million or 8.5%. And this includes $358 million from FX-neutral cash adjusted EBITDA growth, benefits from lower cash interest costs due to the recent refinancing initiative, and about $23 million in favorable translational FX impacts. 
Partially offsetting these items is a $62 million increase in FX-neutral cash taxes versus the prior year. As well as a slight increase in total maintenance CapEx. On a per share basis, we expect consolidated AFFO growth to be nearly 8.5% for the year, setting the stage for us to achieve double-digit per share growth if we drive some outperformance versus current expectations. 
Moving on to Slide 17. Let's review our capital deployment in 2020 and our expectations for 2021. In 2020, we deployed about $2 billion for our dividend while spending roughly $1.1 billion on CapEx, with more than 85% of that being discretionary. Part of that discretionary spend was to build nearly 5,900 sites throughout our global footprint, a new record for American Tower. We spent around $5.5 billion, including the assumption of debt, to acquire new assets and additional stakes in our Africa and India businesses from JV partners, and we also dedicated about $56 million to buybacks. 
In total, we deployed nearly $9 billion in 2020, a record year for American Tower while staying within our leverage targets and simultaneously strengthening the balance sheet. We again expect to deploy capital in a consistent, balanced manner in 2021. This includes $1.4 billion committed to CapEx, again, largely discretionary and about $2.3 billion allocated towards our dividend, assuming a growth rate of around 15% in subject to Board approval. 
Included in our discretionary CapEx spend is the expected construction of 6,500 new sites worldwide, an increase of more than 600 sites compared to 2020. Day 1 NOI yields on these bills are expected to continue to average more than 10%. And new build CapEx remains as our highest return investment with solid anchor tenant credit quality. In addition, and as I'll talk more in a minute, we expect to close our pending Telxius acquisition this year for total consideration of about $9.4 billion. 
Including this transaction, we expect that roughly 90% of our total capital deployment in 2021 will be in investment-grade rated geographies with investment-grade carriers. As you can see on the right side of the slide, our discipline to capital allocation strategy, coupled with solid operational execution and a strong balance sheet has enabled us to drive consistent reoccurring long-term growth in consolidated AFFO per share. 
And we expect more of the same this year. In fact, in 2021, we expect our 2020 investments in new builds and M&A to generate around $0.15 in incremental consolidated AFFO per share. We continue to believe that both consolidated AFFO per share growth and attractive returns on invested capital are critical to our creation of long-term sustainable stockholder value. 
Now turning to Slide 18. I will discuss our financing plans for the pending Telxius acquisition. As a reminder, this transaction is transformational for our European business as it delivers significant scale in key markets, is expected to drive some of the highest organic tenant billings growth rates available in the region. And based on our analysis, represents the best portfolio of Tower assets that has come to market in Europe. 
The total consideration will be approximately $9.4 billion, and we anticipate completing the purchase in 2021 through multiple closings. We expect the first closing to consist of a large portion of the European assets in late Q2, with the remaining assets in Europe and Latin America closing in late Q3. Of course, this time line may shift as the regulatory process unfolds. 
As we communicated when we announced the deal, we plan to finance the transaction in a manner consistent with maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. We anticipate this will include bringing our net leverage, which stood at 5x at the end of 2020, up to the high 5x range temporarily. Importantly, we are committed to organically delevering back down to a level consistent with our stated financial policy of 3 to 5x net leverage over a multiyear period. 
On the debt funding front, we expect to utilize a combination of our recently upsized revolving credit facility and new euro-denominated term loans and plan to opportunistically consider long-term sources including senior unsecured notes. The balance of the total consideration is expected to be funded with equity, which may include common stock issuances, mandatory convertible preferred instruments and/or private capital raised through the sale of minority stakes of our European subsidiary to one or more private investment partners. 
On the private capital side, we are currently engaged in discussions with a select group of premier strategic investors who not only can provide capital but also have considerable experience in telecommunications infrastructure and in the European region specifically. We are encouraged by our progress on this front. And if terms are sufficiently attractive, are optimistic that we can complement a public equity issuance with a high-quality strategic private capital raise. As always, through this process, we remain disciplined and focused on minimizing dilution to our common stockholders, while optimizing our long-term value creation objectives. 
On Slide 19, and in summary, 2020 was a very strong resilient year for American Tower with solid organic growth, operational efficiencies, providing high conversion rates, record new build activity, accretive M&A and continued value creation for our shareholders. 
Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term potential of our business. Our comprehensive portfolio is well positioned to capture meaningful lease-up as new spectrum assets and new network technologies are deployed globally. In the U.S., activity is ramping up, and we expect to continue to create significant value through the master lease agreements with key tenants. 
We stand ready to quickly integrate the new Telxius assets this year and leverage our expanded European presence for significant future growth, which will complement our operations in other less mature markets. Taking into account continued strong tailwinds from secular growth trends in mobile, we expect to be able to deliver attractive, sustainable growth in revenues and cash flows for years to come while driving compelling total stockholder returns. 
And with that, operator, will you please open the line for questions."

First, you mentioned that you do expect that gross activity is likely to increase from here. One of your peers outlined a view that, that will begin in the second half of this year. I'm wondering if that's the same assumption you've embedded in your outlook. I'm also curious how sensitive your outlook is to that. I think at this point, you have an MLA with all of your major customers. And so perhaps the variability here is narrower.
And then just on churn, I think you suggested a nonSprint churn was going to be in the 2% range this year, which is a bit above trend. I'm wondering if there's anything we need to focus on. And then I believe T-Mobile has indicated they're going to be shutting down the Sprint CDMA network, I think, starting next year, is that captured in your churn assumptions as well?"

So with regards to our U.S. organic tenant billings growth as we roll into 2021, let me get a couple of the component drivers that will be factors, including the new business. S",467,"Thanks, Brett. So I'll take that. This is Rod Smith. Thanks for the question. So with regards to our U.S. organic tenant billings growth as we roll into 2021, let me get a couple of the component drivers that will be factors, including the new business. So as you saw in the presentation, we expect to have organic tenant billings growth of around 3% for 2021. That's down from about 4.6% in 2020. There's a few factors driving that. The first one is that our monthly run rate new biz is anticipated to increase by about 15% year-over-year. So that's going to drive some growth there in our organic tenants billings growth. That obviously is being offset by a couple of factors. One is, as you mentioned, the Sprint churn. 
So we do expect to begin to see Sprint churn in Q3 of 2021. And as you saw in the presentation in some of our prepared remarks, we are expecting over the next 4 years to have about $375 million of annualized Sprint churn. The vast majority of that ends up coming in, in the beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 so we'll see churn begin in the fourth quarter. That will represent about $200 million of annualized run rate that will begin to come off in Q4 of 2020. That has a drag on organic tenants billings growth of almost 100 basis points. So that explains a big chunk of that step down between year-over-year. 
The next piece that I would highlight is the activity levels coming out of 2020. So everyone knows there was kind of a slowdown from T-Mobile and Sprint in 2020, began in 2019 and way into 2020. That slowdown has flow through effect into 2021, which also impact our growth rates. And that is going to impact the beginning of the year, the first half of the year, more than the second half of the year. So that's probably consistent with what you may have heard from some other folks.
And then the final piece is this, the size of our base is getting bigger, and that usually brings down growth by about 20 bps. So we have that as well. And then I would -- the final point I would make on the organic tenant billings growth is our organic tenant billings growth is not that sensitive to the timing of activity and even other network decommissioning as it's mostly made up of contracts that have minimum levels of activity and predefined churn reductions and those sorts of things.
So there's not a lot of variability in our numbers from that perspective. And then in terms of the Sprint, I guess I addressed the Sprint churn numbers. So I think that probably addresses that part of your question, Brett?"

No. I think the way you framed it up is correct. So we expect churn -- normal churn to be within that 1% to 2% range, pretty consistent, nothing abnormal there.

So we expect churn -- normal churn to be within that 1% to 2% range, pretty consistent, nothing abnormal there. And then the Sprint churn, again, that begins in Q4, we'll have about 100 basis point hit. So when you think about that, all in, our annual churn would be in the range of 3%, a little bit above what our normal range is. And again, as you see the quarters unfold in 2021, the fourth quarter will be where you'll see the kind of that big bump up in the churn numbers.
And then, of course, that will take 1/4 of that in 2021. And then there'll be flow-through effects from that churn into 2022, where we get 3/4 of that churn in 2022. And that, of course, will have a flow-through negative impact on the 2022 growth numbers. But gross new -- and gross new business is accelerating as we head into 2021, and we expect that to continue into 2022. It's really the churn that will partially or fully offset that in 2021 or 2022."

With regards to your first comment, I mean, there are no new MLAs that -- I mean, we already have MLAs in place with the major carriers. So there's nothing else that's driving that, which I think is what your question was.
The most significant MLA that we've recently amended clearly with T-Mobile. And so that's what's really impacting, if you will. And as I mentioned, over 2/3 of -- over the planning period that we're talking about, 2/3 of our growth rates are locked in. And so we have a tremendous visibility in terms of what that's going to look like. And as I mentioned, we have $59 billion or $60 billion of already contractually committed revenue on the books.
So that gives us, I think, some really good comfort in terms of what we would expect. On top of that, we will also have the large Telxius transaction that will kick in, as Rod said, throughout the year. And so we'll have that benefit continuing forward, which kind of gets into your second question. We've looked at, as I mentioned in my comments, over the last 5 years, we're talking about double-digit growth rates in terms of AFFO per share.
I'm compensated candidly on the bulk on AFFO per share growth as well as return on invested capital. So those are 2 critical benchmarks for myself and my team. So we obviously spend a lot of time working through all of the elements of those. In 2022, yes, there is going to be the trough of the T-Mobile churn that we're going to see. We know what it is. We're working on opportunities now to be able to mitigate a lot of that as we go into 2022. We put out an initial guide for 2021 at that 8.5% level.
We are all hoping that we're going to be able to improve on that for 2021, particularly as we bring on kind of the Telxius transaction. And then we're working through what 2022 will look like. But clearly, are committed to driving that double-digit AFFO per share growth over the long period of time, as we've done in the past.
And so we've had historically consolidations going on. As you know, we've had consolidation churn in India over the past. No doubt that the T-Mobile-Sprint churn is a large item for us that we need to address. But our teams are working on it diligently right now. And we're trying to work through that. And -- but clearly, we are committed to driving that double-digit kind of growth."

And now with the presence that we have there, particularly with the rooftops, we now have that dense urban area covered, which we didn't have before. So I think it really positions us well to be able to capture new business."

And that's where I think that your pro forma for Telxius were 220,000 sites. We're looking to build 40,000 to 50,000 more sites over the next several years. We have a massive global platform, Ric, which I think is really going to be -- put us in a really unique spot to be able to offer that global platform through hyperscalers, data center companies, even global MNOs who are looking for that kind of a ubiquitous type of a capability. 
And so that's what we're looking and trying to build here. This is not a 2021 real big revenue opportunity. I think it's going to take a few years. But we have MOUs in place with several companies in the United States, working with them on different kind of value propositions, different type of market entries. We have proof of concepts that we're in -- we're dropping in front of the major MNOs. 
And so we're very excited on it about it. We're spending a lot of think time working through this and working with potential partners. This is not something that we would be looking to bring entirely on our own. So I do see this as an opportunity to be partnering with a number of other players to bring in. I think that even in our own market in the United States, in our portfolio, there are probably 4,000 or 5,000 sites that we've identified where we think that we can bring in several shelters into a site, being able to offer up 20 to 30 cabs with 100 to 300, 400 kilowatts of power.
And so I think we're uniquely positioned to be able to do this not just in the United States, but globally. But I do think it will be start in the United States. But as I said, I think our global reach really puts us in a unique position to be able to offer a high-value prop to potential customers."

As Rod said and I alluded to as well, we continue to remain really positive on the market overall. It's a work in progress, as you well know. We're looking at growth -- gross growth in the market of double digit. The challenge is the churn, and it's coming down on a year-over-year basis, and we will -- it will continue to come down. And that's what we need to be working on with our carriers, particularly Vodafone in the region, and we are working on that as we speak.
And so over the longer period of time, I would expect that churn to be coming down and for us to be really be able to start to drive the positive net organic growth. I mean, if you take a look at our overall international markets, we're growing 7% to 9% in Latin America and Africa. Europe, as I mentioned before with Ric, we really see some nice growth, I think, that we're going to be experiencing there. So it is India. It is that focus on that particular market that we need to drive that will bring up the overall, clearly, the growth rate in the -- in an international space. And there are a number of things that have to happen in the marketplace, which we see happening they just don't happen very quickly.
Clearly, the government is committed to Digital India, to their Digital India program. I think the pandemic has made that even more obvious because so many Indians are looking for telehealth services, and they need that broadband connection. So everything that we're hearing, we're seeing is really giving me even more and more comfort. That the government is going to be supporting the carriers to really being able to densify the overall network.
And we're seeing that. We're seeing it in the build programs. Clearly, we're seeing that from all of the 3 major carriers in the marketplace. We're starting to see price increases in the market, which I think is really positive. We're also seeing our customers, in particularly, Vodafone, looking to identify different areas to be able to infuse capital.
I also just saw yesterday from an AGR perspective that the government is now relooking at some of the new calculations that the carriers were being opposed on that they are going to have to pay over the next 10 years or so. So again, I think that's just indicative of the fact that the government very much wants -- each and every one of the carriers to survive and to participate to their own digitization that's going on within the marketplace. But we got more work to do.
We've got to work through the contracts that we have in place, particularly with Vodafone to try to nip some of that churn. But as I said, we're seeing the growth in the marketplace, which I think is what we've always seen is that opportunity. And so now we need to work on that the churn, which is exactly what we're doing."

So now it's at 6%. 
And I guess the question then becomes 2 questions. One, can you disaggregate that 6% growth into organic growth inflation-based escalators and new builds relative to the U.S.? And then can you disaggregate it regionally with respect to which regions are going to be driving more than 6%? And I guess your answer to Simon's question just now, maybe India is on the lower end of that 6%, if that calculation is correct."

David, well, thanks for that question. Let me take a -- I'll start it, and then I'm sure Rod and Igor might be able to fill in some of the pieces. But as I talked about it, I mean you're right. We talked about kind of a 6% to 8% kind of growth range",776,"Okay. David, well, thanks for that question. Let me take a -- I'll start it, and then I'm sure Rod and Igor might be able to fill in some of the pieces. But as I talked about it, I mean you're right. We talked about kind of a 6% to 8% kind of growth range on a consolidated basis, right? 
If you go back a number of years. Now we are twice the size of business that we were back then. So growth on a base of that size does get to be a little bit more challenging. But if you even take a look at the numbers that I laid out for the U.S., this is just organic, right? And so it's not -- it does not include the our build-to-suit programs. In the United States, the big item there is the Sprint churn. And so that's why we kind of laid it out, looking at the next couple of years.
And then even layering in on top of, okay, what would that growth look like perhaps without that Sprint churn. And that's growth goes next couple of years being on average in the United States organically a couple percent but being up in that 5% range to the extent that we did not have it. And then you go out longer term, '23 to '27 in United States, where it would be greater or equal to 5% and then without it greater equal to 6%. 
So it's kind of getting back. And particularly, if you then weigh in the fact that the business is so much bigger, it's getting back to those ranges. And we're looking at some of that growth coming from some of our platform extension initiatives, but not in any significant way. I mean, it's largely from pure organic growth coming from our contractually committed master lease agreements that we have with our customers.
On the international side, we didn't necessarily come out with kind of long-term growth projections for them other than saying that we would expect it to be a couple of 100 basis points higher than what we're seeing in the United States. So given that, you would look at the '23to '27 kind of average up in that 7%, 8% normalized without the kind of -- without the impact of the churn in the United States.
So it's we're really rather consistent with some of those growth rates that we laid out several years ago. And as I said that we do have a much bigger base of business. What's also exciting, though, is on the build-to-suit program that's driving tens of millions of dollars of new revenue for us each and every year.
We do have and I do expect, as I mentioned, kind of sites on adding 40,000 to 50,000 new build-to-suits over the next 5 years. We set records kind of every month, every year in terms of the building of these double-digit NOI. So it's really good return of capital for us and with good tenants. So it really provides upside to our overall growth rate that we expect going forward.
With the Telxius deal and the heavier European presence, we're getting a little bit more of a presence in even the developed markets. And I would expect, as I mentioned, I think it was to Ric, up 6% kind of growth rates are kind of being expected from my perspective in Germany. And I think that there's really a lot of opportunities there. 
So again, just kind of stepping back, I don't think they're inconsistent with what we've said in the past. We are a bigger business. We did -- we do have the big Sprint churn event, which will impact us over the next couple of years, which is to no one's surprise, kicking in really the fourth quarter here. We talked about that right out of the gate with that up being churn in that kind of 4 percentage range, if you will, of our business. And it really did land on that. 
And I think we've been able to put in place a long-term contract with T-Mobile who are really in a very good position from a spectrum perspective and a build perspective, and I think we're going to be very aggressive. And so given the kind of master lease agreement we have in place with them, I'm really excited about the kind of the strategic relationship that we have with them to be able to explore new stuff and new areas of business so kind of long rambling answer for your question, but I think it's pretty consistent."

The high level pieces of that, we maintain a 3% escalator in our business. So that's a piece of that 6%. We expect new business to drive 4% to 5% in that range. And then churn outside of Sprint would be back down into the -- between 1% and 2%. That's how you get to that 6% over that '23 to '27 time frame."

That is at the top of our stated financial policy of 3 to 5x. When it comes to Telxius and financing, the Telxius acquisition, of course, we expect to do that in a manner that's consistent with maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. That's always been important unless it continues to be very important to us. And we've been engaged in a variety of fronts here since we announced that deal in terms of preparing some financing.
The first thing I would note is we do have the committed bridge led by Bank of America, and we've gone further and syndicated that. So we have that in place as a backstop. You've also seen us in the debt market here in terms of the bank facilities, we upsized a couple of our revolvers. We also entered into a new term loan that's euro denominated.  That's about $1.5 -- or $1.9 billion value. So we've got increased liquidity from that perspective. 
We did end 2022 at about $4.5 billion or almost $1.9 billion of liquidity, and these are additive to that, to prepare for the closing. One thing that we are comfortable with doing. We've been working with the rating agencies. We've been doing a lot of internal analysis, and we're comfortable increasing our leverage to the high 5x as and when we close the Telxius deal, and then we'll be committing to delevering back into within our financial policies over a couple of year time period.
So you will see us with higher leverage probably for an extended time period. And I'll let you do the math, Colby, in terms of what that might mean in terms of how much we'll raise from that to actually execute on the Telxius transaction. The balance of the purchase price that will remain, we'll look at a number of different equity sources. We're looking at public equity. We're looking at mandatory converts, and we're also looking at private capital. And we're doing a lot of different analysis. 
Around that, we will make the best decisions for our shareholders in terms of maximizing total shareholder return, maximizing AFFO per share growth and also looking to help make sure that we have a really strong balance sheet as we go into the future, so we can continue to grow. 
So when you think about that, one of the things we've done is we've looked very hard at raising private capital. We've done a lot of work there. We're continuing to be engaged with just a small number of very large premier investors around the world, and we maintain a high level of confidence there that, that could be a very attractive vehicle for our shareholders. So we're continuing to explore that. And we'll make the decisions kind of along the way. 
And I would say when you think about private capital, we are in our analysis and the way we're thinking about it, we would be selling minority stakes in our European business. It's not really related to the Telxius transaction specifically. It's the entire European business that we would look to finance potentially by adding some private capital in there. 
And in terms of the mix, how much private capital versus how much public equity, will be making those decisions here over the coming weeks and months as we kind of work through the analysis and get closer to closing. Did that hit all your points, Colby?"

Good morning, everyone. As is typical in our first quarter call, the focus of my comments today will be on our foundational U.S. business, which represented nearly 58% of our total property revenue and more than 2/3 of our consolidated prope",2374,"Thanks, Igor. Good morning, everyone. As is typical in our first quarter call, the focus of my comments today will be on our foundational U.S. business, which represented nearly 58% of our total property revenue and more than 2/3 of our consolidated property segment operating profit in Q1 while accounting for about 3/4 of our $60 billion in contractually committed revenue. The overall NOI yield of our U.S. property segment now stands at 11.5%. The sites in the portfolio for at least 10 years, generating more than 20%. These metrics reflect our long track record of driving strong, profitable, recurring cash flow growth in the U.S., and we remain confident in our ability to extend that track record long into the future.
This confidence is inspired not only by the exceptional visibility we have into our long-term organic growth rates through our existing comprehensive master lease agreement, but also due to a number of favorable industry trends that we expect to drive our business forward. These trends, in large part, center on our customers' 5G network deployments which we expect to meaningfully accelerate over the next several years, giving rise to a more developed 5G world.
On the demand side of the equation, mobile data usage growth shows no signs of slowing. The average smartphone user in the U.S. is currently consuming more than 15 gigabits per month and is expected to be using more than 50 gigabits on a monthly basis by 2026, reflecting a CAGR of nearly 30%. The proliferation of value-added streaming services, mobile video conferencing and other content-rich bandwidth-intensive applications continues to stress existing 4G wireless network, creating the need for more material additional network capital investments.
An emerging AR and VR applications and other next-gen capabilities are contributing virtually nothing to mobile data uses today given the limited coverage and low 5G device penetration. But we don't think that will be the case for long. The 5G network revolution is underway, and it's quite possible, perhaps even likely, the current growth projections for U.S. mobile data usage will prove to be conservative, much like what we've seen in the past. The development of 5G-related low-latency application services, additional growth from enterprise accounts and even fixed wireless applications in the home could all drive usage much higher over time. We expect that the increased availability of spectrum in the marketplace, particularly on the mid-band side, will help enable this usage growth going forward.
Spectrum has always been the lifeblood of the wireless industry. And given the capacity necessary to provide users a true 5G experience, it is more important today than ever before. Particularly significant, in our view, our mid-band spectrum assets, like 2.5 gig in the newly acquired C-band frequencies, as they provide our customers with a crucial middle ground between the attractive propagation characteristics of low-band spectrum and the deep capacity characteristics of higher band. We believe the results of the most recently completed C-band auction underscore the importance of this spectrum to our customers as they look to monetize the benefits of 5G.
Importantly, as the carriers emphasized in their public comments after the auction, we expect this spectrum to be deployed quickly. The wireless industry is in a strong financial position, and numerous steps have been taken by the carrier to not only fund the upfront purchase price of the spectrum, but also to effectively deploy it. In fact, we are already seeing sizable increases in activity in our own services segment. And consistent with our long-term outlook expectations, we expect to see higher levels of gross new business in our property segment beginning later this year, particularly in '22 and beyond.
Part of this uptick in activity is in rural area, as stimulus funds from the government support smaller companies to effectively deploy wireless Internet services and as the major operators continue to fill in the white spaces in their network. The deployment of fixed wireless for households around the country using mid-band spectrum as our customers are planning could also provide further opportunities for us going forward.
Taking all of these factors into account, we believe we have a highly attractive long-term monetization opportunity in front of us. The carriers further densify their network and add more equipment to existing lease sites to support their incremental capacity needs. A significant portion of this growth is locked in to our existing contractual relationships. Other components of the growth may be more variable. Either way, we expect to see higher levels of activity in the marketplace, accompanied by increasing wireless CapEx spend. On this point, analysts are projecting more than $35 billion in average annual capital spending from our customers over the next several years, which would represent industry record.
With that in perspective, that average annual rate is more than double what the carriers sent back when 2G was actually deployed. While each of our customers have slightly different strategies to deploy 5G, we are confident that they will be successful in doing so.
We also believe that our macro tower-oriented U.S. portfolio of over thousand sites is optimally positioned to benefit from these accelerating deployment. Macro sites continue to be, by far, the most cost-effective RF efficient network engineering option and are also optimally located to help deliver coverage and capacity for hundreds of millions of people nationwide. As a result, we continue to believe that the vast majority of mid-band deployments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future will be on macro towers. As our network infrastructure was ideally suited for our customers' needs for 2G, 3G and 4G, we have no reason to believe that 5G will be any different.
While we do expect to be unique to 5G is the added use of massive MIMO technology for mid-band spectrum deployments on our macro towers which should provide operators with more dynamic coverage and capacity capabilities, the race to nationwide 5G with the use of massive MIMO will require more fiber connections to antennas, increased DC power and enough capacity to accommodate the size and weight of these more intelligent RF solutions.
To prepare for these requirements, we have been proactively investing in more efficient and scalable power solutions at many of our sites. We've also upgraded the capacity of many of our tower structures over the last decade, installed energy-efficient LED lighting on many sites and invested in site hardening initiatives where appropriate. Simply put, we stand ready to service our customers as they accelerate their 5G deployment.
Importantly, macro sites may even be more critical today given the incremental density network that will require to support a 5G architect. And because only 1 of our existing tenants is on more than half of our sites today, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive incremental lease and capacity utilization as densification initiatives ramp up. As has been our experience, we would expect roughly $0.90 of every dollar we generate from this organic leasing activity will flow straight to the bottom line. As a result, we expect to continue to drive strong operating leverage in the business along with modest capital intensity, reflecting 2 of the hallmark of our last several decades to growth. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate strong operating profit margins, including more than 78% in 2021.
All of these factors contribute to our confidence in our ability to drive average annual U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth of at least 5% in 2027, normalized for the Sprint turn impact and at least 6%, from 23% to 27% specifically, calculated on the same basis. Importantly, more than 2/3 of this growth is now contractually locked in given the signing of our MLA with DISH in the first quarter. Embedded with these expectations is the assumption that our portfolio of wireless tower will be our fastest-growing asset, as has been the case over the last 5 years when our organic tenant billings growth was an average of roughly 40 basis points higher than our overall U.S. metric. This resilient trend, in our view, is another point of validation. Macro tower will continue to be the focal point of modern wireless network, generating the best economics across the telecommunications real estate universe.
Going forward, we expect these economics to get even better. Margins will benefit from densification-driven leasing activity and continued amendment, while costs will remain largely fixed and capital intensity to continue to be low. Existing leases will escalate in historical rate of at least 3%, and normal force churn should be quite modest, likely trending down over time, particularly once we work through the sprint cancellations over the next few years. We intend to remain laser-focused on maximizing our sustainable cash flow growth from these fundamental 5G drivers.
We also believe that the economics of our U.S. business and specifically of our macro tower site can be further enhanced through the implementation of selective platform expansion initiatives. Chief among them is edge compute, which is starting to come into clear view as true 5G becomes a reality for consumers and perhaps even more importantly, for the enterprise segment. We expect the key drivers of demand for edge compute solutions to be the emerging need for incremental cloud brand locations and lower latency applications processing in a 5G environment. As more and more data processing evolves to the network edge to support those needs, we anticipate new micro edge data center architecture will be necessary to complement the existing regional framework.
Select locations within our nationwide macro tower asset base, which, by definition, RS and mobile network edge, are positioned to play a meaningful role in this evolution. The underlying thesis supporting this lead is the concept net that suggests it has been for the last 2 decades in the deployment of wireless networks, shared neutral host infrastructure will be the most cost-effective and efficient way to rapidly deploy cloud-native 5G applications at scale. And given that our attractively located tower sites have existing access to fiber and end power while already hosting multiple communications providers, they are natural candidates to represent hub locations for these low-latency wireless edge data centers.
Scale deployment of the true mobile edge remains several years away. But in our view, the TAM could be quite significant, running well into the billions of dollars annually. In the meantime, we have some half-dozen ongoing small-scale distributed commute trials at our tower sites, creating a beachhead to larger scale through mobile edge deployment. Additionally, our co-lo ATL facility continues to outperform our expectations, and we are having meaningful conversations with a number of key stakeholders across the data center and cloud sectors regarding the optimal requirements for the 5G Edge.
As we've noted previously, we intend to explore global joint ventures or partnerships to effectively leverage these inherent opportunities. And we continue to work through a number of different scenarios in that front. The early data points we are seeing throughout the industry all suggest that this can be a meaningful scalable opportunity that can represent solid upside for us in due time. And we are devoting resources internally to ensure that we are in a position to be opportunistic and agile.
In the context of the long-term outlook we discussed last quarter, we believe that mobile edge compute could eventually represent meaningful potential --. Having said that, we are going to remain disciplined from a capital deployment perspective, as you would expect. Recurring revenue for all long-term growth prospects, healthy ROIC and an attractive margin profile are all prerequisite for us to deploy meaningful capital anywhere, and that includes our efforts on the platform expansion side. Our preliminary assessments indicate that the edge opportunity fits nicely into our framework, but we will need to prove out this thesis going forward.
So taking into account the strong underlying baseline growth path we have in the U.S. for the next decade, we are in a position to be thoughtful, deliberate and strategic with these types of initiatives. Additionally, while we are laser-focused on driving incremental value in the U.S., we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy capital internationally, for high-quality scaled macro tower portfolios are likely to come to market. And while my comments today are focused on our U.S. operation and marketplace, the exact same approach can be duplicated globally. Whether it's growth, platform expansion opportunities or margin expansion, the message globally are identical.
With our roughly 220,000 site pro forma for the Telxius acquisition, we have an unmatched presence in some of the fastest-growing wireless broadband market period. And we can offer to a number of different parties and one-stop capability that is second to none. While we would expect to expand the depth of this presence over time so as not to be complacent, we believe it already gives us a significant competitive advantage.
As we've always done on a global basis, we will be seeking to maximize long-term growth and AFFO per share while maintaining attractive returns on invested capital. We also continue to invest in our people, our systems and processes and remain focused on numerous ESG initiatives while dedicating ourselves to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company.
To summarize, I want to reiterate our excitement about the U.S. market. We are in the very early stages of a transformative there in U.S. wireless technology, one that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we live, work and play while opening them up tremendous new possibilities across numerous industries. Our extensive portfolio of communications real estate across the country sits at the cross-section of the elements that can make this transformation a reality. And as a result, we are positioned to drive compelling long-term stockholder returns while continuing to provide industry-leading service level to both existing and new customers.
Finally, I want to recognize our nearly 6,000 employees around the world who are working tirelessly for all of us, achieving the types of results Rod is going to walk you through now, particularly to this horrific pandemic, is really remarkable, and I want them to know just how much we all appreciate their dedication and hard work.

I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy.
As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a strong start in 2021 as 5G ramps up in the U.S. and as carriers in our international markets deploy significant capital towards their network enhancement initiative.
Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights for the quarter. First, we announced the acquisition of Telxius, which we believe will be transformational for our European business. We also signed a master lease agreement with DISH, which locks in attractive multiyear growth in cash property revenue for us beginning in 2022. Second, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, and we saw this reflected in both our solid tenant billings growth and in the high volume of new builds in the quarter.
Third, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment-grade balance sheet, issuing $1.4 billion in senior unsecured notes and refinancing existing debt at highly attractive rates. And finally, we made good progress regarding the financing plan for our expanding European business, including private capital. We expect to communicate specific details of our plan prior to closing the first tranche of towers, which we anticipate will be later this quarter.
With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.13 billion grew by 7.9% or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 1.7% or 5.8% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. These growth rates were right in line with our expectations and continue to reflect the essential nature of mobile services and the importance of our tower portfolio throughout our served markets.
Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was once again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was 4.1%, including 3.6% in our U.S. and Canada segment and 5% in our international markets. In the U.S., we had a solid quarter of gross new business commencement as expected, and churn was right in the middle of our historical 1% to 2% range escalators were 2.6%, impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLA with T-Mobile. For the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends.
Meanwhile, international organic tenant billings growth was particularly strong in Latin America, coming in at 7.9%, and was also quite solid in Africa, where we generated growth of 7.4%. In both regions, we are continuing to see our tenants actively deploying equipment across their network as mobile data consumption grows rapidly. Activity in Nigeria was a highlight once again, and we continue to expect growth in that market to ramp up going forward.
We also had a strong quarter in Europe, particularly in Germany, where gross new leasing growth was around 7%, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In India, we saw an organic tenant billings growth decline of 1.6%, in line with our expectations as we continue to work through the latter stages of AGR and consolidated related churn in the market.
On the gross new business side, we saw another solid quarter, which was further complemented by contributions from the more than 5,000 sites we have constructed in the market since the beginning of 2020. Notably, Global commenced monthly new business in the quarter, including contributions from new build was more than $11 million, up about 17% versus the prior year period and representing a new ATC record level.
Turning to Slide 7. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% or 14.9% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.44 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 66.7%, up nearly 3 full percentage points over the prior year, driven by continued organic growth and prudent cost controls throughout the business as well as the benefits of straight-line revenue related to the T-Mobile MLA signed late last year. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was 6.6% for the quarter as significant scale across our footprint continued to yield benefits, along with some bad debt reversals in India.
Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share each grew by about 24%. These growth rates included the benefit of the nonrecurrence of about $63 million in onetime cash interest expense booked in Q1 of last year associated with our purchase of MTN's minority stake and our Ghana and Uganda business. Normalizing to that item, growth would have been around 16%, the highest rate in several years. This was driven by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA as well as lower-than-expected cash interest, nonrecurring cash tax refunds and seasonally low maintenance CapEx.
I will note that the cash tax and maintenance CapEx trends we saw this quarter are largely attributable to timing, so these lines are expected to pick back up over the rest of the year. As a result, we expect that Q1 will be the highest level of quarterly consolidated AFFO per share that we see in 2021. Finally, on an FX-neutral basis, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth for the quarter would have been right around 26%.
Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to the negative impacts of translational FX fluctuations in some of our international markets, we are reducing our property revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint. On an FX-neutral basis, we would be increasing our property revenue expectations due to higher pass-through and straight-line revenue internationally.
Second, despite these FX headwinds, we are raising our outlook for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. The adjusted EBITDA outperformance is primarily attributable to higher expected contributions from our services segment, driven by preconstruction site acquisition, zoning and permitting work for our customers as well as slightly more favorable SG&A trends in the business. Regarding our improved AFFO expectations, in addition to the services outperformance, we are anticipating lower cash taxes and cash interest expense for the year.
Finally, for our historical practice, our revised outlook continues to exclude the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financing. We expect the transaction to close in multiple tranches, beginning with the majority of the European sites later in the second quarter and with some of the German rooftops in the Latin America sites in Q3. Once the assets begin to close, we will update further iterations of our guidance to include these contributions. We look forward to quickly integrating the portfolio and as previously noted, expect the deal to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share.
With that, let's turn into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 7.5% at the midpoint. The decline as compared to the prior guidance is due to approximately $48 million in negative translational FX impact, which is being partially offset by about $23 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue.
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth projections across all regions as the global leasing environment remains consistent with our prior expectations across our footprint. We continue to expect consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 3% to 4% in 2021. In the U.S., as Tom outlined earlier, we anticipate a prolonged period of strong growth, driven by 5G-related densification initiatives by the carriers as they roll out multiple spectrum bands. We continue to expect that gross new business activity will accelerate through the year and into 2022.
Looking to Latin America, organic tenant billings growth is expected to be roughly 7% for the year. Despite some challenges around COVID trends in the region, carrier activity remained consistent as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments. In Africa, we expect to generate organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8%, driven primarily by spending on 4G deployment. We are seeing especially strong growth in Nigeria, where new business trends continue to inflect positively in where our contract structures with key tenants are supporting growth. As we move into the back of the year, we anticipate that Africa organic tenant billings growth will accelerate to above 9%.
In Europe, we continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% for the full year and are seeing solid trends, particularly on the gross new business side. We're especially encouraged by what we are seeing in Germany, where organic tenant billings growth excluding churn hit 7% in Q1 for the first time. We expect positive new business trends to continue going forward as incumbent carriers accelerate their 5G initiatives and as a new tenant begins to roll out its network.
Finally, in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. While we believe we're in the very late stages of the consolidation process, we maintain our expectation that we will see elevated churn this year as the post-AGR environment sorts itself out. With that said, we remain optimistic that the long-term growth trajectory in the market should be more favorable, particularly given that the structural framework of the wireless sector today is probably the most constructive it has been in the last decade.
Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of 9.6% despite about $30 million in negative translational FX impact as compared to our prior outlook. Around $33 million in incrementally expected services gross margin, $3 million or so in net straight-line favorability and about $4 million in lower cash SG&A is enabling us to more than offset the FX headwind. The services activity we are seeing is broad-based and spread across multiple tenants and, in our view, another indication that U.S. network investment activity is in the early stages of a sustainable acceleration.
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of over 9%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.25 per share. Services segment outperformance as well as about $13 million in net cash interest and cash tax favorability are driving this upside in enabling us to absorb about $25 million in unfavorable FX impact. On a per share basis, we expect growth of 9% for the year and continue to drive towards our goal of delivering double-digit growth.
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021, which are broadly consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continuing focus on driving strong, sustainable growth in consolidated AFFO per share. Distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top capital allocation priority, and we continue to expect to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15%, subject to our Board's approval.
Regarding CapEx, we are raising our projections by $25 million at the midpoint due to some additional expected U.S. land investments and a modest increase in start-up CapEx internationally. On the acquisition front, we spent around $115 million in the first quarter and continue to expect to deploy over $9 billion for the Telxius transaction later this year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress on the financing plan for our European business and our acquisition of the Telxius asset. This includes on the private capital front, where we continue to remain confident that we could bring in 1 or more high-quality strategic counterparties to purchase minority stakes in our European business, not only to help us finance the Telxius transaction, but also to collaborate on future European expansion opportunity.
On the debt side of the equation, we continue to expect to take our net leverage up to the high 5x range. Having completed a U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes offering in Q1, we anticipate that other near-term debt issuances are likely to be euro-denominated. This is consistent with our expected material expansion of euro-based revenues in our business and will enable us to take advantage of highly attractive financing rates.
Finally, any remaining funding needs that isn't covered by debt issuances or private capital will be in the form of equity through a common equity issuance and/or a mandatory convertible preferred issuance. Our goal continues to be to fund this transaction in a way that is not only optimal from a capital structure perspective, but also enables us to optimize shareholder return.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to spend a few minutes on our new build program which has accelerated over the last few years to meet increasing demand for new sites by a number of our key international tenants. As you can see, since 2016 and including our expectations for this year, we will have added over 23,000 sites to our portfolio through new construction. In 2020, we built over 5,800 towers, a new American Tower record, and we're off to a great start in 2021, adding nearly 2,000 sites in our international markets for the quarter, a level of activity only exceeded by that of Q4 of 2020.
Moving to the middle of the slide, you can see that we are seeing highly attractive returns on capital deployed towards new sites. In Q1, average day 1 new build NOI yields were around 12%. In our APAC region where we added over 1,300 sites, we saw highly attractive yields of around 15%. And in Africa,where we added more than 500 sites, we average day 1 returns of over 10%. We're anticipating another record year of new builds in 2021, with 6,500 sites at the midpoint of our outlook. The majority of these deployments will be focused across these same APAC and Africa region, where we expect to drive the most attractive new build returns and where the vast majority of new build activity is for investment-grade anchor tenants.
Looking beyond 2021, we expect this trend of increasing demand for incremental wireless infrastructure to continue as carriers in markets with fast-growing populations and surging demand for mobile data work to enhance their network. We believe that our existing global scale, track record of providing best-in-class service levels and strong relationship with MNOs place American Tower in a favorable position to act as a preferred partner for these large-scale deployments. As such, we'll look to take advantage of the opportunity to continue growing our international portfolio by deploying capital for high-return new build projects. And as Tom noted on last quarter's call, based on the demand we are seeing for new sites internationally, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years.
Finally, on Slide 14 and in summary, Q1 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, dividend growth and strong new build activity. We were able to secure a transformational deal in Europe with the pending Telxius transaction, signed a value-added of long-term MLA in the U.S., continue to enhance our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancings and remain focused on cost controls and driving sustainable recurring growth. We are excited about the global demand for tower space and look forward to making additional progress on many fronts through the rest of the year as we seek to deliver compelling total returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

It seems like Germany, in particular, is very strong, but are you open to that becoming an even bigger part of your future beyond the Telxius deal?

We've been looking at the European market for a better part of a dozen years. And we did create a couple of head properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a number of years ago and have continued to look in those particular markets to see if there are opportunities. One of the challenges that we always saw in those markets were who the counterparty was, what the capital would be required to upgrade the sites themselves and really what were the long-term growth projections and opportunities in the marketplace. And so as such, we were never successful in terms of kind of landing any particular transactions up until the transaction that we're just about ready to close with Telxius. And a lot of that is a function of the relationship, I think, that we've built with Telefonica over so many years and have -- they have such credibility, and I think we have a lot of credibility with them.
And so we were able to put our hands on this particular portfolio. And I think in particular, for those very reasons that I mentioned before that got in the way of us being able to close things, is that there -- the portfolio itself is very solid. It's a terrific set of assets, terrifically located, as I said, good, good counterparty. And now what we're starting to see in the marketplace, as Rod talked about, was really the evolution of 5G. We're starting to see more spectrum being deployed to support 5G. And we're really, I think, just on the front end of what that 5G deployment is going to look like. We see it accelerating, particularly in markets like Germany. And we see the opportunity for a new entrant who is going to be coming into the marketplace.
And so we think it really rounds out our overall portfolio. I think we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have a presence in so many different -- very, very important markets around the globe. And this just increases the overall presence we have and what was kind of a hole, if you will, in our portfolio, given the size of the assets that we had before. And so now we're going to have 30,000 sites in the marketplace, terrific counterparty. And as I said right in the beginning part of what we think is going to be a long-term, a growth trajectory in the region.
And so we'll use that as a way to be able to continue to grow, if it makes sense, and if we find good assets, good opportunities in the region. I think we're positioning ourselves with some very interesting private capital, and so that will increase the overall platform for our ability to grow in the market. I mean they're very passive. We're operating it. I mean they're minority partners, as you would expect, but they're very interested also in growing their portfolios in our base of assets. And hopefully, they'll be able to participate in future potential investments with us.
So I think that this is all coming together quite nicely for us in we've received the approvals to be able to move forward with the transaction in all due respect. And so we're excited about what the region has in front of us. And as I said, equally as important, we're guided now about what that brings to our overall global footprint and how important that could be to CSPs, hyperscalers. Who knows who might be looking for kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, in looking at our over 200,000 sites in these key markets, and we look to continue to grow that. Rod talked about the 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that we're looking at. And so we very much have our sights on increasing our footprint globally, and I think this is a great step."

Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. I hope you're doing well. So from a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announced when we announced that we were entering into the transaction itself. So there's a few broad principles that we're looking for. One is we expect to finance this deal in a way that's consistent with our investment-grade credit. That still is the focus. Our aim is to minimize the dilution of our current common stockholders, so continue to be focused on that as well. And we expect to finance this transaction in a way that supports us being immediately accretive, which is what we said early on, and that's continuing to be our focus and our expectation here as we move forward.
So a couple of things. In terms of the internal workings of the financing plan, I don't want to get into details around the governance and valuation and those sorts of things. The one thing I would say valuation-wise is very consistent with kind of the valuation of what we're doing with Telxius. In terms of the minority stakes that we are selling, we're selling minority stakes potentially in our European business, not just to Telxius, so we would be putting our legacy businesses, combining that with the Telxius assets.
So 1 key point is we do expect our debt to come up to the high 5x. We've said that before. We're still very comfortable in that range. And we do believe that, that's consistent with our investment-grade credit rating and have had many discussions with the credit agencies, and we do not expect any risk of downgrades or outlook changes or anything from that perspective. Additional near-term senior notes that we may issue in order to fund the Telxius transaction are likely to be denominated in euro currency, and that will allow us to take advantage of the very attractive rates that we see in the euro market, certainly.
And then on the private capital front, as Tom alluded to and I mentioned in my comments, we continue to progress along that path, and we're very confident that we can bring in 1 or more very strategic investors. So we certainly are talking to the world's premier investors and certainly folks that understand this space that understand the European market and other markets, quite frankly, as well as have relationships with some of our biggest customers around the globe. So there may be more than just financial benefits here to our shareholders, but also strategically kind of broader partnership benefits as well. So certainly, that's a key focus. And then the final piece of the financing plan will come in the form of equity. So whatever is not funded through the increased net leverage that I talked about and through the euro debt offerings and private capital, we expect to go into the marketing issue and issue some equity.
In terms of timing, we do expect the transaction to begin to close in the second quarter here, probably as early as late May for some of the European markets. The Latin American markets were originally expecting that they would close probably in sometime -- in Q3. There is a chance that Brazil and some of the other markets could close as early as the end of May or at some point in Q2, but we'll continue to kind of work through the timing there. There will be some assets, but particularly some select rooftops that will close in Europe in Q3, not in Q2. So we will have multiple closings across Q2 and across Q3.
So that's kind of the way that it shakes out. And again, we remain very confident of this financial plan and our patience and kind of putting it together and managing through the details is really going to pay off for our shareholders. And we're in very good shape to begin to execute on this in the month of May as we prepare to close the first tranches of the Telxius transaction."

First of all, kind of where we are, I mean we have a 6-country fiber footprint: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, S.A. and India,",496,"And then, Jon, with regard to your second question on where we are with fiber is one of our platform extension industries. First of all, kind of where we are, I mean we have a 6-country fiber footprint: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, S.A. and India, and we cover over 30,000 route kilometers. We actually passed 1.25 million homes in those markets. And the networks themselves are a mix of active long-haul metro to B2B in Mexico and Brazil and a concentration of fiber-to-the passive optical networks in S.A., Colombia, Brazil and Argentina. We've spent over $1 billion of CapEx over the past 4 years in those markets, $700 million for acquisitions and $300 million for development and readout development CapEx.
So we've been monitoring it very, very closely from a revenue perspective. I think we generated about $100 million in 2020. And our ROIC for those particular investments selectively is in kind of the 5%, 5.5% kind of range. Interestingly, the S.A. asset, return on invested capital is probably double that. So what we're thinking about strategically again is we're looking at this from an initiative perspective, a platform initiative perspective, some of the underlying elements of it, foundations of it, again, go back to how we're looking at the overall power, the multiservice, multi-tenant, a long-term anchor contract, escalators, exclusive real estate rights, a way for us to really be able to create a competitive advantage and really complement the kind of the power returns that we've been experiencing for the last 10 years or so.
So our strategy really has somewhat kind of 2-pronged, I would say. The first is to pivot and transform our current fiber businesses in Mexico and Brazil to wholesale long-term contracts. We'll be looking to do this through long-term contracts with Tier 1 carriers also going to involve some strategic inorganic transactions like we were just talking about before. And the focus is clearly creating a competitive long-term strategic asset in those markets.
And then the second strategy really entails kind of reaching certain economics in these deployments, particularly in S.A. and Brazil and are focused on future investments in some of our emerging neutral host open access network. So we'll continue to be opportunistic where it obviously makes sense, be monitoring it very closely, but we do see that -- we'll see a kind of a shift to open passive optical multi-tenant access network over time. We think that's a great way to be able to improve the return on invested capital.
And our regional focus is currently right now on Latin America and where most of the assets are and leveraging our existing MNO relationships. So we think we can create that model in LatAm and then be able to scale it globally. So I mean that's kind of where we are. It's still a work in progress. But I think we're -- we've learned a lot, and I think we're making great progress on the strategy."

The margins are broadly consistent year-over-year, so we're expecting that mid- to just a touch above mid-50% margin. That's similar to what we saw in 2020. That's what we're expecting in 2021.
In terms of the timing of the services revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of, let's say, applications and kind of activity in the market, and we expect that to continue throughout the next couple of quarters. So more than 60% of the revenue of the $175 million is back-end weighted, so we would expect in Q3 and 4, both of those periods would be north of $50 million per quarter in terms of revenue. So that's kind of the way to think about services.
Services, what we're seeing really is kind of a broad-based increase in services that goes across most -- all of our large customers, certainly, and it's focused on ADP engineering, mouth analysis, things like that. Those sorts of activities are generally kind of front-end loaded. That services work happens well before you see leasing activity and any kind of enough lift in leasing revenue. So it's a really good sign here in terms of the activity level, the services that we see kind of ramping up towards the end of this year and as we transition into 2022.
Certainly, when you think about India and bad debt, there's still a few places where we're watching customers around the globe, a couple in Africa and a couple in India. Certainly, we're doing really well. There's no significant incremental bad debt in our outlook. In our accounts receivable, the way it sits at the end of Q1 is broadly in line with the way that it's set at the end of Q1 last year, so we haven't had a significant increase in accounts receivables. So we continue to collect and be pleased with the way that our customers are paying in India and in the select places in Africa that we're watching. We did end up unwinding a bad debt reserve in India by just under $10 million or so, so that's certainly a good sign.
But with that said, we continue to kind of watch India. There's a few things that we're looking for relative to some of our customers there in terms of capital raise projects that they're in. And certainly, the amount of liabilities through the AGR and some of the activity between our customers and the government to try to negotiate those fees, kind of we watch back quite closely. But that's really the story on accounts receivable and bad debt. So we've had a good quarter. We did well throughout 2020. And we don't have any significant incremental bad debt in our outlook for 2021."

Can you, for the benefit of us generally across this global portfolio that you have, can you kind of maybe tick off the next 1, 2 or 3 markets where you're expecting this kind of opportunity to emerge with spectrum auctions forthcoming? And then the second question is John Stankey at AT&T kind of study was ""giddish"" about the supply chain marketplace even in the United States. Could you talk about how you're thinking about the supply chain, chip availability, specifically affecting your company's our customers' ability to deploy and how you kind of factored that into your thinking about the guide?"

Maybe I'll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. I mean what we're seeing around the globe is I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marke",660,"Yes. No, sure, David. Maybe I'll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. I mean what we're seeing around the globe is I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marketplace. And we're even -- we're seeing in India, we're seeing clearly in Europe, we're seeing in Latin America and the wide select slot of spectrum. For 5G to be effective, you need a wider slot for spectrum. You can't beat a 10 meg, you're looking at 20 to 40 to 60 meg of spectrum. And so that's the first sign, I think, David, that we see because, as I mentioned and as what you all know, spectrum is the lifeblood of being able to roll out any of these new technologies and for 5G to be able to truly realize the full 5G experience in terms of speed and latency, you need significant amounts of it.
And so I look at -- and in my comment before on Europe, what we've seen in certain of those critical markets -- countries in Europe, really stepping up to launching a lot of new spectrum. And I think that's one of the reasons that we're really now starting to see some come outsized growth in those particular markets, something that we hadn't seen for several years, and that was really -- that really drove us to  looking at some of the growth curves in that market for us to even lean into some of the assets that are there. And so that's just kind of the first sign of it, I think.
You look at markets like Africa, though, I mean Africa, I think Rod had mentioned they're kind of in the 8%, looking at growing to the 9%, even kind of ending out the year. You look at markets like Nigeria and things like that, where we're talking kind of double-digit growth rate. I mean that's just because the wireline presence there just doesn't exist. And wireless broadband is everything that our customers are investing in. So you have slightly different reasons for some of the growth. Many of the markets are just getting into 4G, so we're still on the front of that 4G curve.
And Latin America, you look at Brazil growth, you look at the Mexico growth, I mean, they're in the kind of the 7%, 8% kind of growth range. So we're really excited about what we're seeing outside of the United States. And what's really driving it clearly is more spectrum, more wireless penetration. Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually driven even more of a need for connectivity. And so we're seeing even more wireless usage in those markets in particular, again, because the wireline markets are just so foreign and nonexistent.
And so we would expect to see Europe kicking in with 5G. Africa continued growth as 4G becomes more of a reality there. Latin America, similarly, 4G into 5G ultimately. And even in India, the growth there is strong. We've got the churn issues that we have to deal with in that particular market, and we're getting our arms around and making sure that we really nail those there. But it's not a growth issue, they've got new spectrum, they've got 4G. You see the likes of Facebook. You see all of the big foreign investments that's coming into the marketplace. And so it's really an exciting market from a broadband wireless perspective.
So I mean that kind of gives it on a global scale. And from a supply chain perspective, we don't see any impact on our side from a supply chain perspective at this point. I mean our customers are the ones that are kind of frontline with issues that they may have from some of the OEMs and things like that. But at least from our perspective, we're not seeing any impact from that perspective."

No, I mean let me take a step back a little bit in terms of kind of what we're seeing from an evolution perspective, if you will. First of all, the total market is, in fact, developing. With regards to specific to the edge, we are at kind of the beginning. And we're seeing certain elements aligned, if you will, but we're really starting to -- and trying to participate in those, but we really are at the beginning size of it.
If you start to think about kind of, first of all, the C-RAN impact, what the cloud impact is, we just saw some recent announcements in the market relative to the cloud players aligning with some of the MNOs and we've seen Verizon doing that over the last year or so, what we're starting to see is, if you think about kind of the 4G low mid-band power market and what it looks like at the site level, as we move into the 5G and the low band, mid-band, what we're starting to see at the site, for example, is a lot of MIMO is going to be starting to be deployed, a lot of tenant arrays, a lot of new fiber that's going up to the poles themselves 5 to 10 times more fiber strands needed, higher power, more heat. And so there's a lot of elements that are going on actually at the site itself which is going to drive more and more equipment.improvements to the public radio interface on the front haul, which connects actually the tower to the baseband unit itself.
And so now what we're starting to see is we're seeing Cloud-RAN and O-RAN. From an O-RAN perspective, it's just different types of equipment that our customers are able to put together to be able to load on to the site. And at the kind of at the base level, at the baseband unit which is where the data center element comes in, we're starting to see disaggregation at the baseband unit level into the DU and to the CU level. And that's giving our customers the ability and us to be able to look at where, in fact, we might be able to expand and be able to enjoy some of this additional compute capability that's going to exist at the -- out at the edge as the 5G experience becomes more prevalent throughout the country.
So we continue and expect to see this incremental convergence of this wireline and wireless and network. We think it stresses the importance of that first mile network architecture. And so as a result, we are actually very, very excited about the opportunity. It's a shared neutral host solution. We think it's going to be very efficient added at the site level.
And we actually are exploring it and going down the path of really 2 elements, right, 2 ways, if you will. We've talked about the distributed compute. The enterprise workloads continue to move on to the public cloud, and so there's a growing near-term market segment that's in use of that kind of off-prem cloud computing is really a hybrid solution. And so we're located on some tent, if you will, of our sites. And you'll see them. There are shelters there, there's power, there's capability to be able to offer this kind of a capability to these kind of midsized enterprise account.
And they're actually being quite successful. They're loading up very quickly. And believe me, they're not meaningful from an AMC perspective, but they are absolutely meaningful from an experience perspective and learning exactly what our customers are going to be looking for. The bigger opportunity for us is still at the mobile edge compute side. And so that will become, we believe, more of a reality as that 5G world becomes more developed. And so we have a number of MOUs with a number of different players focused on solutions to the MNOs as well as focused on solutions to the cloud service provider.
And so we're exploring those, putting those in front of those particular accounts and looking at what the ultimate opportunity would be. I mean the site is a perfect location for bringing able to and be able to expand our customers' edge compute capability, not just within the United States, but on a global basis. If we can bring in 500 kilowatts of power into particular site with a number of shelters that exist in the site to be able to load up racks and servers, we think -- and give that cloud ramp which will actually exist in that BU, so that's why that disaggregation is so important between those 2 particular elements of the RAN. We think that we can enjoy some significant opportunity upside here from this whole initiative.
And so it is an extension of our existing platform, again, neutral host, but it really provide ultimately that cloud ramp which we think is going to be needed to be able to enjoy that kind of latency that our enterprise accounts and customers are going to be looking for."

There could be some timing issues associated with the build. The need is there. I'm certain that the sites are going to be built. So within a market like India who are suffering so significantly right now, there can be a timing issue in terms of having essential people out in the marketplace to be able to build. Clearly, lives stay is more important than tower still. So there could be some timing there -- issues.
But ultimately, over that 5-year period, we are seeing the demand for the 40,000 to 50,000 sites that Rod laid out. And our forecast right now is for that 6,000 to 7,000 sites, there could be some timing issues associated with particularly the sites in India. I'm not seeing the same implications in Africa at this point in time. And by the way, our overall 6,000 to 7,000 sites, that outlook already includes some carving back of what we are expecting overall in the marketplace.
And relative to COVID, overall, as we've seen over the last year, our business is quite resilient. People need connectivity I think that's been more obvious than ever over this past year, particularly in many of our global markets. And so our customers are doing everything possible that they can to be able to maintain that kind of connectivity. We're doing everything we possibly can to be able to support them to be able to ensure that kind of connectivity.

Thanks for the question, Batya. So I'll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I missed any, just to remind you, maybe I'll start at the end and work backwards a little bit.So the escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for",761,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Batya. So I'll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I missed any, just to remind you, maybe I'll start at the end and work backwards a little bit.
So the escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for Q1 was about 2.6%. That really was driven by the impact of the -- of timing mechanics within the T-Mobile MLA. As we signed a new MLA with T-Mobile, the escalator shifted from 1 period to another, and that affected the volume of escalator in Q1. But for the full year, we do expect the escalated to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above potentially. And Q2, we do expect the escalator for the U.S. to be 3.1%. So there's no structural change, there's no permanent shift, it really is just a timing issue.
And I'll also point out, it's a little ahead of time, but in 2022, you may see some lumpiness as well with the escalator given the time shift here. But again, 2022 for the full year, we anticipate the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above as usual. So no, nothing to be concerned there. We haven't had any philosophy shift and no kind of contractual change in terms of what the escalator is. It remains at 3% and as it always has in the U.S.
So then I think your next question was relative to the long-term guidance. So maybe I'll just take a minute to remind the folks on the call of what that is. So we're looking at, over the next 7 years, we put our guidance at least 4% organic tenant billings growth on average over that time period. That includes the Sprint churn which will begin to roll off of our billing later this year in Q4 in the beginning of October. If you normalize for that, we're looking at that long-term organic growth rate in the U.S. of about 5%.
The other thing that I would point out here is if you look at just the first couple of years, '21 and '22 on a Sprint impacted basis where we'll see that churn again beginning in Q4 of 2021, the expected organic billings, including that, will be around 2%. But normalizing that, it will be around 5%. Once we get clear from that, when you get out to '23 and beyond, so '23 out to '27, even with the impact of the print churn, we're predicting organic tenant billings growth north of 5% and on a normalized basis for that same time period north of about 6%.
So we are very excited and confident about the future in the U.S. We are seeing an acceleration of gross new biz. We're seeing that today. We expect that to continue, and that really is fueling the these very solid organic tenant buildings predictions over a long period of time. Again, that's 7 years.
And just a couple of key components here. I'll remind you, 23% or 2/3 of this, 2/3 of this revenue that we need to hit these things are already contracted in our long-term agreements in some of these holistic deals. So that's key. That includes DISH kind of being in here in the assumptions with some modest activity which potentially could be outperformed depending on the pace and the level of their network build over that time period. And some of the C-band spectrum deployments for some carriers in some of the years maybe in addition here and outside of kind of the traditional holistic that we're looking for that potentially as an upside.
And then in terms of the co-location amendment mix, we're currently still at heavy amendment, 80% and 20% co-location. That's the way it's been for a little while. It may vary from carrier to carry, but that's what it's been consistently. And we expect that, that will be the case for a couple of years. But going out longer term, it will vary. We do expect that there could be a higher percentage of co-locations than we've traditionally seen as the carriers deploy this higher band spectrum and they have a need to densify their network builds over time. So we're certainly planning for some of that as well, but it's probably too early to predict that too much specificity in terms of what that will be in terms of the mix in the out years.
And was there another piece in your question, Batya, that I didn't address?"

The overall NOI yield of our U.S. property segment now stands at 11.5%. The sites in the portfolio for at least 10 years, generating more than 20%. These metrics reflect our long track record of driving strong, profitable, recurring cash flow growth in the U.S., and we remain confident in our ability to extend that track record long into the future.
This confidence is inspired not only by the exceptional visibility we have into our long-term organic growth rates through our existing comprehensive master lease agreement, but also due to a number of favorable industry trends that we expect to drive our business forward. These trends, in large part, center on our customers' 5G network deployments, which we expect to meaningfully accelerate over the next several years, giving rise to a more developed 5G world.
On the demand side of the equation, mobile data usage growth shows no signs of slowing. The average smartphone user in the U.S. is currently consuming more than 15 gigabits per month and is expected to be using more than 50 gigabits on a monthly basis by 2026, reflecting a CAGR of nearly 30%. The proliferation of value-added streaming services, mobile video conferencing and other content-rich bandwidth-intensive applications continues to stress existing 4G wireless network, creating the need for more material additional network capital investments.
An emerging AR and VR applications and other next-gen capabilities are contributing virtually nothing to mobile data uses today given the limited coverage and low 5G device penetration. But we don't think that will be the case for long. The 5G network revolution is underway, and it's quite possible, perhaps even likely. The current growth projections for U.S. mobile data usage will prove to be conservative, much like what we've seen in the past. The development of 5G-related low-latency applications and services, additional growth from enterprise accounts and even fixed wireless applications in the home, could all drive usage much higher over time. We expect that the increased availability of spectrum in the marketplace, particularly on the mid-band side, will help enable this usage growth going forward.
Spectrum has always been the lifeblood of the wireless industry. And given the capacity necessary to provide users a true 5G experience, it is more important today than ever before. Particularly significant, in our view, our mid-band spectrum assets, like 2.5 gig in the newly acquired C-band frequencies, as they provide our customers with a crucial middle ground between the attractive propagation characteristics of low-band spectrum and the deep capacity characteristics of higher band. We believe the results of the most recently completed C-band auction underscore the importance of this spectrum to our customers as they look to monetize the benefits of 5G.
Importantly, as the carriers emphasized in their public comments after the auction, we expect this spectrum to be deployed quickly. The wireless industry is in a strong financial position, and numerous steps have been taken by the carrier to not only fund the upfront purchase price of the spectrum, but also to effectively deploy it. In fact, we are already seeing sizable increases in activity in our own services segment. And consistent with our long-term outlook expectations, we expect to see higher levels of gross new business in our property segment beginning later this year, particularly in '22 and beyond.
Part of this uptick in activity is in rural area, as stimulus funds from the government support smaller companies to effectively deploy wireless Internet services and as the major operators continue to fill in the white spaces in their network. The deployment of fixed wireless for households around the country using mid-band spectrum as our customers are planning could also provide further opportunities for us going forward.
Taking all of these factors into account, we believe we have a highly attractive, long-term monetization opportunity in front of us. The carriers further densify their network and add more equipment to existing lease sites to support their incremental capacity needs. A significant portion of this growth is locked in to our existing contractual relationships. Other components of the growth may be more variable. Either way, we expect to see higher levels of activity in the marketplace, accompanied by increasing wireless CapEx spend. On this point, analysts are projecting more than $35 billion in average annual capital spending from our customers over the next several years, which would represent industry record.
Put that in perspective, that average annual rate is more than double what the carriers [ had ] back when 2G was actually deployed. While each of our customers have slightly different strategies to deploy 5G, we are confident that they will be successful in doing so.
We also believe that our macro tower-oriented U.S. portfolio of over thousand sites is optimally positioned to benefit from these accelerating deployment. Macro sites continue to be, by far, the most cost-effective RF-efficient network engineering option and are also optimally located to help deliver coverage and capacity for hundreds of millions of people nationwide. As a result, we continue to believe that the vast majority of mid-band deployments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future will be on macro towers. As our network infrastructure was ideally suited for our customers' needs for 2G, 3G and 4G, we have no reason to believe that 5G will be any different.
While we do expect to be unique to 5G is the added use of massive MIMO technology for mid-band spectrum deployments on our macro towers, which should provide operators with more dynamic coverage and capacity capabilities. The race to nationwide 5G with the use of massive MIMO will require more fiber connections to antennas, increased DC power and enough capacity to accommodate the size and weight of these more intelligent RF solutions.
To prepare for these requirements, we have been proactively investing in more efficient and scalable power solutions at many of our sites. We've also upgraded the capacity of many of our tower structures over the last decade, installed energy-efficient LED lighting on many sites and invested in site hardening initiatives where appropriate. Simply put, we stand ready to service our customers as they accelerate their 5G deployment.
Importantly, macro sites may even be more critical today given the incremental density network that will require to support a 5G architect. And because only one of our existing tenant is on more than half of our sites today, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive incremental lease and capacity utilization as densification initiatives ramp up. As has been our experience, we would expect roughly $0.90 of every dollar we generate from this organic leasing activity will flow straight to the bottom line. As a result, we expect to continue to drive strong operating leverage in the business, along with modest capital intensity, reflecting 2 of the hallmark of our last several decades to growth. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate strong operating profit margins, including more than 78% in 2021.
All of these factors contribute to our confidence and our ability to drive average annual U.S. and Canada organic tenant billings growth of at least 5% through 2027, normalized for the Sprint turn impact and at least 6%, from 23% to 27% specifically, calculated on the same basis. Importantly, more than 2/3 of this growth is now contractually locked in given the signing of our MLA with DISH in the first quarter. Embedded with these expectations is the assumption that our portfolio of wireless tower will be our fastest-growing asset, as has been the case over the last 5 years when our organic tenant billings growth was an average of roughly 40 basis points higher than our overall U.S. metric. This resilient trend, in our view, is another point of validation. Macro Tower will continue to be the focal point of modern wireless network, generating the best economics across the telecommunications real estate universe.
Going forward, we expect these economics to get even better. Margins will benefit from densification-driven leasing activity and continued amendment, while costs will remain largely fixed and capital intensity to continue to be low. Existing leases will escalate in historical rate of at least 3%, and normal force churn should be quite modest, likely trending down over time, particularly once we work through the sprint cancellations over the next few years. We intend to remain laser-focused on maximizing our sustainable cash flow growth from these fundamental 5G drivers.
We also believe that the economics of our U.S. business and specifically of our Macro Tower site can be further enhanced through the implementation of selective platform expansion initiatives. Chief among them is edge compute, which is starting to come into clear view as true 5G becomes a reality for consumers and perhaps even more importantly, for the enterprise segment. We expect the key drivers of demand for edge compute solutions to be the emerging need for incremental cloud brand locations and lower latency applications processing in a 5G environment. As more and more data processing evolves to the network edge to support those needs, we anticipate new micro edge data center architecture will be necessary to complement the existing regional framework.
Select locations within our nationwide Macro Tower asset base, which, by definition, RS and mobile network edge, are positioned to play a meaningful role in this evolution. The underlying thesis supporting this lead is the concept net that suggests it has been for the last 2 decades in the deployment of wireless networks, shared neutral host infrastructure will be the most cost-effective and efficient way to rapidly deploy cloud-native 5G applications at scale. And given that our attractively located tower sites have existing access to fiber and end power while already hosting multiple communications providers, they are natural candidates to represent hub locations for these low-latency wireless edge data centers.
Scale deployment of the true mobile edge remains several years away. But in our view, the TAM could be quite significant, running well into the billions of dollars annually. In the meantime, we have some half-dozen ongoing small-scale distributed commute trials at our tower sites, creating a beachhead to larger scale through mobile edge deployment. Additionally, our co-lo ATL facility continues to outperform our expectations, and we are having meaningful conversations with a number of key stakeholders across the data center and cloud sectors regarding the optimal requirements for the 5G Edge.
As we've noted previously, we intend to explore global joint ventures or partnerships to effectively leverage these inherent opportunities. And we continue to work through a number of different scenarios in that front. The early data points we are seeing throughout the industry all suggest that this can be a meaningful scalable opportunity that can represent solid upside for us in due time. And we are devoting resources internally to ensure that we are in a position to be opportunistic and agile.
In the context of the long-term outlook we discussed last quarter, we believe that mobile edge compute could eventually represent meaningful potential upside. Having said that, we are going to remain disciplined from a capital deployment perspective, as you would expect. Recurring revenue for all long-term growth prospects, healthy ROIC and an attractive margin profile are all prerequisite for us to deploy meaningful capital anywhere, and that includes our efforts on the platform expansion side. Our preliminary assessments indicate that the edge opportunity fits nicely into our framework, but we will need to prove out this thesis going forward.
So taking into account the strong underlying baseline growth path we have in the U.S. for the next decade, we are in a position to be thoughtful, deliberate and strategic with these types of initiatives. Additionally, while we are laser-focused on driving incremental value in the U.S., we expect to have attractive opportunities to deploy capital internationally, for high-quality scaled Macro Tower portfolios are likely to come to market. And while my comments today are focused on our U.S. operation and marketplace, the exact same approach can be duplicated globally. Whether it's growth, platform expansion opportunities or margin expansion, the message globally are identical.
With our roughly 220,000 site pro forma for the Telxius acquisition, we have an unmatched presence in some of the fastest-growing wireless broadband market, period. And we can offer to a number of different parties and one-stop capability that is second to none. While we would expect to expand the depth of this presence over time so as not to be complacent, we believe it already gives us a significant competitive advantage.
As we've always done on a global basis, we will be seeking to maximize long-term growth and AFFO per share while maintaining attractive returns on invested capital. We also continue to invest in our people, our systems and processes and remain focused on numerous ESG initiatives while dedicating ourselves to ensuring a diverse and inclusive culture throughout the company.
To summarize, I want to reiterate our excitement about the U.S. market. We are in the very early stages of a transformative there in U.S. wireless technology, one that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we live, work and play while opening them up tremendous new possibilities across numerous industries. Our extensive portfolio of communications real estate across the country sits at the cross-section of the elements that can make this transformation a reality. And as a result, we are positioned to drive compelling long-term stockholder returns while continuing to provide industry-leading service level to both existing and new customers.
Finally, I want to recognize our nearly 6,000 employees around the world who are working tirelessly for all of us, achieving the types of results Rod is going to walk you through now, particularly to this horrific pandemic, is really remarkable. And I want them to know just how much we all appreciate their dedication and hard work.
With that, let me hand the call over to Rod to discuss our first quarter results and updated outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. As you saw in today's press release, we're off to a strong start in 2021 as 5G ramps up in the U.S. and as carriers in our international markets deploy significant capital towards their network enhancement initiative.
Before getting into the details of our Q1 results and revised outlook, I want to touch on a few highlights for the quarter. First, we announced the acquisition of Telxius, which we believe will be transformational for our European business. We also signed a master lease agreement with DISH, which locks in attractive multiyear growth in cash property revenue for us beginning in 2022. Second, demand for our towers continues to be strong throughout our global footprint, and we saw this reflected in both our solid tenant billings growth and in the high volume of new builds in the quarter.
Third, we continue to leverage the capital markets to support our investment-grade balance sheet, issuing $1.4 billion in senior unsecured notes and refinancing existing debt at highly attractive rates. And finally, we made good progress regarding the financing plan for our expanding European business, including private capital. We expect to communicate specific details of our plan prior to closing the first tranche of towers, which we anticipate will be later this quarter.
With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you can see, our Q1 consolidated property revenue of $2.130 billion grew by 7.9% or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 1.7% or 5.8%, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. These growth rates were right in line with our expectations and continue to reflect the essential nature of mobile services and the importance of our tower portfolio throughout our served markets.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Organic growth was once again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was 4.1%, including 3.6% in our U.S. and Canada segment and 5% in our international markets. In the U.S., we had a solid quarter of gross new business commencement as expected, and churn was right in the middle of our historical 1% to 2% range. Escalators were 2.6%, impacted by certain timing mechanics within our MLA with T-Mobile. For the full year, we expect escalators to come in right around 3%, consistent with historical trends.
Meanwhile, international organic tenant billings growth was particularly strong in Latin America, coming in at 7.9%, and was also quite solid in Africa, where we generated growth of 7.4%. In both regions, we are continuing to see our tenants actively deploying equipment across their network as mobile data consumption grows rapidly. Activity in Nigeria was a highlight once again, and we continue to expect growth in that market to ramp up going forward.
We also had a strong quarter in Europe, particularly in Germany, where gross new leasing growth was around 7%, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. In India, we saw an organic tenant billings growth decline of 1.6%, in line with our expectations as we continue to work through the latter stages of AGR and consolidated related churn in the market.
On the gross new business side, we saw another solid quarter, which was further complemented by contributions from the more than 5,000 sites we have constructed in the market since the beginning of 2020. Notably, Global commenced monthly new business in the quarter, including contributions from new build was more than $11 million, up about 17% versus the prior year period and representing a new ATC record level.
Turning to Slide 7. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% or 14.9% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.440 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 66.7%, up nearly 3 full percentage points over the prior year, driven by continued organic growth and prudent cost controls throughout the business as well as the benefits of straight-line revenue related to the T-Mobile MLA signed late last year. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was 6.6% for the quarter as significant scale across our footprint continued to yield benefits, along with some bad debt reversals in India.
Moving to the right side of the slide. Consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share each grew by about 24%. These growth rates included the benefit of the nonrecurrence of about $63 million in onetime cash interest expense booked in Q1 of last year, associated with our purchase of MTN's minority stake and our Ghana and Uganda business. Normalizing to that item, growth would have been around 16%, the highest rate in several years. This was driven by high conversion of cash adjusted EBITDA as well as lower-than-expected cash interest, nonrecurring cash tax refunds and seasonally low maintenance CapEx.
I will note that the cash tax and maintenance CapEx trends we saw this quarter are largely attributable to timing, so these lines are expected to pick back up over the rest of the year. As a result, we expect that Q1 will be the highest level of quarterly consolidated AFFO per share that we see in 2021. Finally, on an FX-neutral basis, consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share growth for the quarter would have been right around 26%.
Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook, where I'll start by reviewing a few of the key high-level drivers. First, due to the negative impacts of translational FX fluctuations in some of our international markets, we are reducing our property revenue outlook by $25 million at the midpoint. On an FX-neutral basis, we would be increasing our property revenue expectations due to higher pass-through and straight-line revenue internationally.
Second, despite these FX headwinds, we are raising our outlook for both adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO. The adjusted EBITDA outperformance is primarily attributable to higher expected contributions from our services segment, driven by preconstruction site acquisition, zoning and permitting work for our customers as well as slightly more favorable SG&A trends in the business. Regarding our improved AFFO expectations. In addition to the services outperformance, we are anticipating lower cash taxes and cash interest expense for the year.
Finally, for our historical practice, our revised outlook continues to exclude the impacts of our pending Telxius transaction and its associated financing. We expect the transaction to close in multiple tranches, beginning with the majority of the European sites later in the second quarter and with some of the German rooftops in the Latin America sites in Q3. Once the assets begin to close, we will update further iterations of our guidance to include these contributions. We look forward to quickly integrating the portfolio and as previously noted, expect the deal to be immediately accretive to consolidated AFFO per share.
With that, let's turn into the details of our revised full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of 7.5% at the midpoint. The decline, as compared to the prior guidance, is due to approximately $48 million in negative translational FX impact, which is being partially offset by about $23 million in additional international pass-through and straight-line revenue.
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth projections across all regions as the global leasing environment remains consistent with our prior expectations across our footprint. We continue to expect consolidated organic tenant billings growth of 3% to 4% in 2021. In the U.S., as Tom outlined earlier, we anticipate a prolonged period of strong growth, driven by 5G-related densification initiatives by the carriers as they roll out multiple spectrum bands. We continue to expect that gross new business activity will accelerate through the year and into 2022.
Looking to Latin America. Organic tenant billings growth is expected to be roughly 7% for the year. Despite some challenges around COVID trends in the region, carrier activity remained consistent as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments. In Africa, we expect to generate organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8%, driven primarily by spending on 4G deployment. We are seeing especially strong growth in Nigeria, where new business trends continue to inflect positively in where our contract structures with key tenants are supporting growth. As we move into the back of the year, we anticipate that Africa organic tenant billings growth will accelerate to above 9%.
In Europe, we continue to expect organic tenant billings growth of over 3% for the full year and are seeing solid trends, particularly on the gross new business side. We're especially encouraged by what we are seeing in Germany, where organic tenant billings growth, excluding churn, hit 7% in Q1 for the first time. We expect positive new business trends to continue going forward as incumbent carriers accelerate their 5G initiatives and as a new tenant begins to roll out its network.
Finally, in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. While we believe we're in the very late stages of the consolidation process, we maintain our expectation that we will see elevated churn this year as the post-AGR environment sorts itself out. With that said, we remain optimistic that the long-term growth trajectory in the market should be more favorable, particularly given that the structural framework of the wireless sector today is probably the most constructive it has been in the last decade.
Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of 9.6% despite about $30 million in negative translational FX impact as compared to our prior outlook. Around $33 million in incrementally expected services gross margin, $3 million or so in net straight-line favorability and about $4 million in lower cash SG&A is enabling us to more than offset the FX headwind. The services activity we are seeing is broad-based and spread across multiple tenants and, in our view, another indication that U.S. network investment activity is in the early stages of a sustainable acceleration.
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of over 9%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.25 per share. Services segment outperformance as well as about $13 million in net cash interest and cash tax favorability are driving this upside in enabling us to absorb about $25 million in unfavorable FX impact. On a per share basis, we expect growth of 9% for the year and continue to drive towards our goal of delivering double-digit growth.
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our capital deployment expectation for 2021, which are broadly consistent with our prior outlook and reflect our continuing focus on driving strong, sustainable growth in consolidated AFFO per share. Distributing capital to our common shareholders remains our top capital allocation priority, and we continue to expect to allocate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15%, subject to our Board's approval.
Regarding CapEx, we are raising our projections by $25 million at the midpoint due to some additional expected U.S. land investments and a modest increase in start-up CapEx internationally. On the acquisition front, we spent around $115 million in the first quarter and continue to expect to deploy over $9 billion for the Telxius transaction later this year.
As I mentioned earlier, we have made substantial progress on the financing plan for our European business and our acquisition of the Telxius asset. This includes on the private capital front, where we continue to remain confident that we could bring in one or more high-quality strategic counterparties to purchase minority stakes in our European business, not only to help us finance the Telxius transaction, but also to collaborate on future European expansion opportunity.
On the debt side of the equation, we continue to expect to take our net leverage up to the high 5x range. Having completed a U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes offering in Q1, we anticipate that other near-term debt issuances are likely to be euro-denominated. This is consistent with our expected material expansion of euro-based revenues in our business and will enable us to take advantage of highly attractive financing rates.
Finally, any remaining funding needs that isn't covered by debt issuances or private capital will be in the form of equity through a common equity issuance and/or a mandatory convertible preferred issuance. Our goal continues to be to fund this transaction in a way that is not only optimal from a capital structure perspective, but also enables us to optimize shareholder return.
Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to spend a few minutes on our new build program, which has accelerated over the last few years to meet increasing demand for new sites by a number of our key international tenants. As you can see, since 2016 and including our expectations for this year, we will have added over 23,000 sites to our portfolio through new construction. In 2020, we built over 5,800 towers, a new American Tower record, and we're off to a great start in 2021, adding nearly 2,000 sites in our international markets for the quarter, a level of activity only exceeded by that of Q4 of 2020.
Moving to the middle of the slide. You can see that we are seeing highly attractive returns on capital deployed towards new sites. In Q1, average day 1 new build NOI yields were around 12%. In our APAC region where we added over 1,300 sites, we saw highly attractive yields of around 15%. And in Africa,where we added more than 500 sites, we average day 1 returns of over 10%. We're anticipating another record year of new builds in 2021, with 6,500 sites at the midpoint of our outlook. The majority of these deployments will be focused across these same APAC and Africa region, where we expect to drive the most attractive new build returns and where the vast majority of new build activity is for investment-grade anchor tenants.
Looking beyond 2021. We expect this trend of increasing demand for incremental wireless infrastructure to continue as carriers in markets with fast-growing populations and surging demand for mobile data work to enhance their network. We believe that our existing global scale, track record of providing best-in-class service levels and strong relationship with MNOs, place American Tower in a favorable position to act as a preferred partner for these large-scale deployments. As such, we'll look to take advantage of the opportunity to continue growing our international portfolio by deploying capital for high-return new build projects. And as Tom noted on last quarter's call, based on the demand we are seeing for new sites internationally, we are targeting the construction of 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years.
Finally, on Slide 14 and in summary, Q1 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, dividend growth and strong new build activity. We were able to secure a transformational deal in Europe with the pending Telxius transaction, signed a value-added of long-term MLA in the U.S., continued to enhance our balance sheet through opportunistic refinancings and remained focused on cost controls and driving sustainable recurring growth. We are excited about the global demand for tower space and look forward to making additional progress on many fronts through the rest of the year as we seek to deliver compelling total returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

Thanks for the question. We've been looking at the European market for a better part of a dozen years. And we did create a couple of head properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a",668,"No, thanks, Simon. Thanks for the question. We've been looking at the European market for a better part of a dozen years. And we did create a couple of head properties, if you will, in France and Germany, pretty small in kind of the 4,000 to 5,000 sites a number of years ago and have continued to look in those particular markets to see if there are opportunities. One of the challenges that we always saw in those markets were who the counterparty was. What the capital would be required to upgrade the sites themselves and really what were the long-term growth projections and opportunities in the marketplace. And so as such, we were never successful in terms of kind of landing any particular transactions up until the transaction that we're just about ready to close with Telxius. And a lot of that is a function of the relationship, I think, that we've built with Telefónica over so many years and have -- they have such credibility, and I think we have a lot of credibility with them.
And so we were able to put our hands on this particular portfolio. And I think in particular, for those very reasons that I mentioned before that got in the way of us being able to close things, is that there -- the portfolio itself is very solid. It's a terrific set of assets, terrifically located, as I said, good, good counterparty. And now what we're starting to see in the marketplace, as Rod talked about, was really the evolution of 5G. We're starting to see more spectrum being deployed to support 5G. And we're really, I think, just on the front end of what that 5G deployment is going to look like. We see it accelerating, particularly in markets like Germany. And that we see the opportunity for a new entrant who is going to be coming into the marketplace.
And so we think it really rounds out our overall portfolio. I think we have a significant competitive advantage in that we have a presence in so many different -- very, very important markets around the globe. And this just increases the overall presence we have and what was kind of a hole, if you will, in our portfolio, given the size of the assets that we had before. And so now we're going to have 30,000 sites in the marketplace, terrific counterparty. And as I said right in the beginning part of what we think is going to be a long-term, a growth trajectory in the region.
And so we'll use that as a way to be able to continue to grow, if it makes sense, and if we find good assets, good opportunities in the region. I think we're positioning ourselves with some very interesting private capital, and so that will increase the overall platform for our ability to grow in the market. I mean they're very passive. We're operating it. I mean they're minority partners, as you would expect, but they're very interested also in growing their portfolios in our base of assets. And hopefully, they'll be able to participate in future potential investments with us.
So I think that this is all coming together quite nicely for us in we've received the approvals to be able to move forward with the transaction, in all due respect. And so we're excited about what the region has in front of us. And as I said, equally as important, we're guided now about what that brings to our overall global footprint and how important that could be to CSPs, hyperscalers. Who knows who might be looking for kind of a one-stop shop, if you will, in looking at our over 200,000 sites in these key markets, and we look to continue to grow that. Rod talked about the 40,000 to 50,000 new builds that we're looking at. And so we very much have our sights on increasing our footprint globally, and I think this is a great step."

And so this is where our rooftop -- our penetration rooftop assets in that market, as we've talked about, is just been so incredibly valuable. And that's a particular asset base that we just didn't have before. We were quite rural in terms of the portfolio we had before, so this really takes it up a few notches in terms of our ability to be successful in the marketplace.

2022, we do have the churn impact associated with the Sprint asset. So could that be a challenge, yes, perhaps, but our goal is still the same. And so I think we have a number of levers. We're going to be bringing on the Telxius assets, which I think we'll be very happy with those results and what that kind of accretion should be, take advantage of the markets. And we'll have our normal solid growth that we see going on in the business, and so we just increased our overall EBITDA performance for 2021.

Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. I hope you're doing well. So from a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announc",696,"Sure, Tom. That sounds great. Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. I hope you're doing well. So from a high level in terms of our Telxius financing, our plan has not changed, and we continue to make very good progress on the path that we originally announced when we announced that we were entering into the transaction itself. So there's a few broad principles that we're looking for. One is we expect to finance this deal in a way that's consistent with our investment-grade credit. That still is the focus. Our aim is to minimize the dilution of our current common stockholders, so continue to be focused on that as well. And we expect to finance this transaction in a way that supports us being immediately accretive, which is what we said early on, and that's continuing to be our focus and our expectation here as we move forward.
So a couple of things. In terms of the internal workings of the financing plan, I don't want to get into details around the governance and valuation and those sorts of things. The one thing I would say valuation-wise is very consistent with kind of the valuation of what we're doing with Telxius. In terms of the minority stakes that we are selling, we're selling minority stakes potentially in our European business, not just to Telxius, so we would be putting our legacy businesses, combining that with the Telxius assets.
So one key point is we do expect our debt to come up to the high 5x. We've said that before. We're still very comfortable in that range. And we do believe that, that's consistent with our investment-grade credit rating and have had many discussions with the credit agencies, and we do not expect any risk of downgrades or outlook changes or anything from that perspective. Additional near-term senior notes that we may issue in order to fund the Telxius transaction are likely to be denominated in euro currency, and that will allow us to take advantage of the very attractive rates that we see in the euro market, certainly.
And then on the private capital front, as Tom alluded to and I mentioned in my comments, we continue to progress along that path, and we're very confident that we can bring in one or more very strategic investors. So we certainly are talking to the world's premier investors and certainly folks that understand this space that understand the European market and other markets, quite frankly, as well as have relationships with some of our biggest customers around the globe. So there may be more than just financial benefits here to our shareholders, but also strategically kind of broader partnership benefits as well. So certainly, that's a key focus. And then the final piece of the financing plan will come in the form of equity. So whatever is not funded through the increased net leverage that I talked about and through the euro debt offerings and private capital, we expect to go into the marketing issue and issue some equity.
In terms of timing, we do expect the transaction to begin to close in the second quarter here, probably as early as late May for some of the European markets. The Latin American markets were originally expecting that they would close probably in sometime -- in Q3. There is a chance that Brazil and some of the other markets could close as early as the end of May or at some point in Q2, but we'll continue to kind of work through the timing there. There will be some assets, but particularly some select rooftops that will close in Europe in Q3, not in Q2. So we will have multiple closings across Q2 and across Q3.
So that's kind of the way that it shakes out. And again, we remain very confident of this financial plan and our patience and kind of putting it together and managing through the details is really going to pay off for our shareholders. And we're in very good shape to begin to execute on this in the month of May as we prepare to close the first tranches of the Telxius transaction."

First of all, kind of where we are? I mean we have a 6-country fiber footprint: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, S.A. and India,",498,"And then, Jon, with regard to your second question on where we are with fiber is one of our platform extension industries. First of all, kind of where we are? I mean we have a 6-country fiber footprint: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, S.A. and India, and we cover over 30,000 route kilometers. We actually passed 1.25 million homes in those markets. And the networks themselves are a mix of active long-haul metro to B2B in Mexico and Brazil and a concentration of fiber-to-the passive optical networks in S.A., Colombia, Brazil and Argentina. We've spent over $1 billion of CapEx over the past 4 years in those markets, $700 million for acquisitions and $300 million for development and readout development CapEx.
So we've been monitoring it very, very closely from a revenue perspective. I think we generated about $100 million in 2020. And our ROIC for those particular investments selectively is in kind of the 5%, 5.5% kind of range. Interestingly, the S.A. asset, return on invested capital is probably double that. So what we're thinking about from -- strategically, again, is we're looking at this from an initiative perspective, a platform initiative perspective, some of the underlying elements of it, foundations of it, again, go back to how we're looking at the overall power, the multiservice, multi-tenant, the long-term anchor contract, escalators, exclusive real estate rights, a way for us to really be able to create a competitive advantage and really complement the kind of the power returns that we've been experiencing for the last 10 years or so.
So our strategy really has somewhat kind of 2-pronged, I would say. The first is to pivot and transform our current fiber businesses in Mexico and Brazil to wholesale long-term contracts. We'll be looking to do this through long-term contracts with Tier 1 carriers. Also going to involve some strategic inorganic transactions like we were just talking about before. And the focus is clearly creating a competitive long-term strategic asset in those markets.
And then the second strategy really entails kind of reaching certain economics in these deployments, particularly in S.A. and Brazil and our focus on future investments in some of our emerging neutral host open access network. So we'll continue to be opportunistic where it obviously makes sense, be monitoring it very closely, but we do see that -- we'll see a kind of a shift to open passive optical multi-tenant access network over time. We think that's a great way to be able to improve the return on invested capital.
And our regional focus is currently right now on Latin America and where most of the assets are and leveraging our existing MNO relationships. So we think we can create that model in LatAm and then be able to scale it globally. So I mean that's kind of where we are. It's still a work in progress, but I think we're -- we've learned a lot, and I think we're making great progress on the strategy."

I hope you're doing well. Thanks for the question. So with regards to our services business, as you saw in the comments earlier and I think Tom alluded to, we are seeing a significant uplift in our services revenue for the",520,"Yes. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Matt. I hope you're doing well. Thanks for the question. So with regards to our services business, as you saw in the comments earlier and I think Tom alluded to, we are seeing a significant uplift in our services revenue for the year. So you saw us raise our full year outlook to about $175 million, up from about $120 million. The margins are broadly consistent year-over-year, so we're expecting that mid- to just a touch above mid-50% margin. That's similar to what we saw in 2020. That's what we're expecting in 2021.
In terms of the timing of the services revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of, let's say, applications and kind of activity in the market, and we expect that to continue throughout the next couple of quarters. So more than 60% of the revenue of the $175 million is back-end weighted, so we would expect in Q3 and 4, both of those periods would be north of $50 million per quarter in terms of revenue. So that's kind of the way to think about services.
Services, what we're seeing really is kind of a broad-based increase in services that goes across most -- all of our large customers, certainly, and it's focused on ADP, engineering, mouth analysis, things like that. Those sorts of activities are generally kind of front-end loaded. That services work happens well before you see leasing activity and any kind of enough lift in leasing revenue. So it's a really good sign here in terms of the activity level, the services that we see kind of ramping up towards the end of this year and as we transition into 2022.
Certainly, when you think about India and bad debt, there's still a few places where we're watching customers around the globe, a couple in Africa and a couple in India. Certainly, we're doing really well. There's no significant incremental bad debt in our outlook. In our accounts receivable, the way it sits at the end of Q1 is broadly in line with the way that it's set at the end of Q1 last year, so we haven't had a significant increase in accounts receivables. So we continue to collect and be pleased with the way that our customers are paying in India and in the select places in Africa that we're watching. We did end up unwinding a bad debt reserve in India by just under $10 million or so, so that's certainly a good sign.
But with that said, we continue to kind of watch India. There's a few things that we're looking for relative to some of our customers there in terms of capital raise projects that they're in. And certainly, the amount of liabilities through the AGR and some of the activity between our customers and the government to try to negotiate those fees, kind of we watch back quite closely. But that's really the story on accounts receivable and bad debt. So we've had a good quarter. We did well throughout 2020. And we don't have any significant incremental bad debt in our outlook for 2021."

Maybe I'll start off and Rod can chime in with some additional commentary. I mean what we're seeing around the globe is I think both Rod and I mentioned even in our remarks, was just an onslaught of new spectrum coming into the marketplace. And we're even -- we're seeing in India, we're seeing clearly in Europe, we're seeing in Latin America and the wide select slot of spectrum. For 5G to be effective, you need a wider slot for spectrum. You can't beat a 10 meg, you're looking at 20 to 40 to 60 meg of spectrum. And so that's the first sign, I think, David, that we see because, as I mentioned and as what you all know, spectrum is the lifeblood of being able to roll out any of these new technologies. And for 5G to be able to truly realize the full 5G experience in terms of speed and latency, you need significant amounts of it.
And so I look at -- and in my comment before on Europe, what we've seen in certain of those critical markets -- countries in Europe, really stepping up to launching a lot of new spectrum. And I think that's one of the reasons that we're really now starting to see some come outsized growth in those particular markets. Something that we hadn't seen for several years, and that was really -- that really drove us to  looking at some of the growth curves in that market, for us to even lean into some of the assets that are there. And so that's just kind of the first sign of it, I think.
You look at markets like Africa, though, I mean Africa, I think Rod had mentioned they're kind of in the 8%, looking at growing to the 9%, even kind of ending out the year. You look at markets like Nigeria and things like that, where we're talking kind of double-digit growth rate. I mean that's just because the wireline presence there just doesn't exist. And wireless broadband is everything that our customers are investing in. So you have slightly different reasons for some of the growth. Many of the markets are just getting into 4G, so we're still on the front of that 4G curve.
And Latin America, you look at Brazil growth, you look at the Mexico growth, I mean, they're in the kind of the 7%, 8% kind of growth range. So we're really excited about what we're seeing outside of the United States. And what's really driving it clearly is more spectrum, more wireless penetration. Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually driven even more of a need for connectivity. And so we're seeing even more wireless usage in those markets in particular, again, because the wireline markets are just so foreign and nonexistent.
And so we would expect to see Europe kicking in with 5G. Africa continued growth as 4G becomes more of a reality there. Latin America, similarly, 4G into 5G ultimately. And even in India, the growth there is strong. We've got the churn issues that we have to deal with in that particular market, and we're getting our arms around and making sure that we really nail those there. But it's not a growth issue, they've got new spectrum, they've got 4G. You see the likes of Facebook. You see all of the big foreign investments that's coming into the marketplace. And so it's really an exciting market from a broadband wireless perspective.
So I mean that kind of gives it on a global scale. And from a supply chain perspective, we don't see any impact on our side from a supply chain perspective at this point. I mean our customers are the ones that are kind of frontline with issues that they may have from some of the OEMs and things like that. But at least from our perspective, we're not seeing any impact from that perspective."

No, I mean let me take a step back a little bit in terms of kind of what we're seeing from an evolution perspective, if you will. First of all, this whole market is, in fact, developing. With regards to specific to the edge, we are at kind of the beginning. And we're seeing certain elements aligned, if you will, but we're really starting to -- and trying to participate in those, but we really are at the beginning size of it.
If you start to think about kind of, first of all, the C-RAN impact, what the cloud impact is, we just saw some recent announcements in the market relative to the cloud players aligning with some of the MNOs and we've seen Verizon doing that over the last year or so. What we're starting to see is, if you think about kind of the 4G low mid-band power market and what it looks like at the site level. As we move into the 5G and the low band, mid-band, what we're starting to see at the site, for example, is a lot of MIMO is going to be starting to be deployed, a lot of tenant arrays, a lot of new fiber that's going up to the poles themselves, 5 to 10x more fiber strands needed, higher power, more heat. And so there's a lot of elements that are going on actually at the site itself, which is going to drive more and more equipment, improvements to the public radio interface on the front haul, which connects actually the tower to the baseband unit itself.
And so now what we're starting to see is we're seeing Cloud-RAN and O-RAN. From an O-RAN perspective, it's just different types of equipment that our customers are able to put together to be able to load onto the site. And at the kind of at the base level, at the baseband unit, which is where the data center element comes in, we're starting to see disaggregation at the baseband unit level, into the DU and to the CU level. And that's giving our customers the ability and us to be able to look at where, in fact, we might be able to expand and be able to enjoy some of this additional compute capability that's going to exist at the -- out at the edge as the 5G experience becomes more prevalent throughout the country.
So we continue and expect to see this incremental convergence of this wireline and wireless and network. We think it stresses the importance of that first mile network architecture. And so as a result, we are actually very, very excited about the opportunity. It's a shared neutral host solution. We think it's going to be very efficient added at the site level.
And we actually are exploring it and going down the path of really 2 elements, right, 2 ways, if you will. We've talked about the distributed compute. The enterprise workloads continue to move on to the public cloud, and so there's a growing near-term market segment that's in use of that kind of off-prem cloud computing. It's really a hybrid solution. And so we were located on some tent, if you will, of our sites, and you'll see them. There are shelters there, there's power, there's capability to be able to offer this kind of a capability to these kind of midsized enterprise account.
And they're actually being quite successful. They're loading up very quickly. And believe me, they're not meaningful from an AMC perspective, but they are absolutely meaningful from an experience perspective and learning exactly what our customers are going to be looking for. The bigger opportunity for us is still at the mobile edge compute side. And so that will become, we believe, more of a reality as that 5G world becomes more developed. And so we have a number of MOUs with a number of different players focused on solutions to the MNOs as well as focused on solutions to the cloud service provider.
And so we're exploring those, putting those in front of those particular accounts and looking at what the ultimate opportunity would be. I mean the site is a perfect location for being able to and being able to expand our customers' edge compute capability, not just within the United States, but on a global basis. If we can bring in 500 kilowatts of power into particular site with a number of shelters that exist in the site, to be able to load up racks and servers, we think -- and give that cloud ramp which will actually exist in that DU, so that's why that disaggregation is so important between those 2 particular elements of the RAN. We think that we can enjoy some significant opportunity upside here from this whole initiative.
And so it is an extension of our existing platform. Again, neutral host, but it really provide ultimately that cloud ramp, which we think is going to be needed to be able to enjoy that kind of latency that our enterprise accounts and customers are going to be looking for."

But particularly in a market like India who are suffering so significantly right now, there can be a timing issue in terms of having essential people out in the marketplace to be able to build. Clearly, lives stayed is more important than tower still. So there could be some timing there -- issues.
But ultimately, over that 5-year period, we are seeing the demand for the 40,000 to 50,000 sites that Rod laid out. And our forecast right now is for that 6,000 to 7,000 sites, there could be some timing issues associated with particularly the sites in India. I'm not seeing the same implications in Africa at this point in time. And by the way, our overall 6,000 to 7,000 sites, that outlook already includes some carving back of what we are expecting overall in the marketplace.
And relative to COVID, overall, as we've seen over the last year, our business is quite resilient. People need connectivity. I think that's been more obvious than ever over this past year, particularly in many of our global markets. And so our customers are doing everything possible that they can to be able to maintain that kind of connectivity.

Thanks for the question, Batya. So I'll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I missed any, just to remind you, maybe I'll start at the end and work backwards a little bit.So the escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for",762,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Batya. So I'll try to remember all of the different aspects here, but if I missed any, just to remind you, maybe I'll start at the end and work backwards a little bit.
So the escalator in the U.S., you saw our escalator for Q1 was about 2.6%. That really was driven by the impact of the -- of timing mechanics within the T-Mobile MLA. As we signed a new MLA with T-Mobile, the escalator shifted from one period to another, and that affected the volume of escalator in Q1. But for the full year, we do expect the escalated to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above potentially. And Q2, we do expect the escalator for the U.S. to be 3.1%. So there's no structural change, there's no permanent shift, it really is just a timing issue.
And I'll also point out, it's a little ahead of time, but in 2022, you may see some lumpiness as well with the escalator given the time shift here. But again, 2022 for the full year, we anticipate the escalator to be right in that 3% range, 3% or just above as usual. So no, nothing to be concerned there. We haven't had any philosophy shift and no kind of contractual change in terms of what the escalator is. It remains at 3% and as it always has in the U.S.
So then I think in your next question was relative to the long-term guidance. So maybe I'll just take a minute to remind the folks on the call of what that is. So we're looking at, over the next 7 years, we put our guidance at least 4% organic tenant billings growth on average over that time period. That includes the Sprint churn, which will begin to roll off of our billing later this year in Q4 in the beginning of October. If you normalize for that, we're looking at that long-term organic growth rate in the U.S. of about 5%.
The other thing that I would point out here is if you look at just the first couple of years, '21 and '22 on a Sprint impacted basis where we'll see that churn again beginning in Q4 of 2021, the expected organic tenant billings, including that, will be around 2%. But normalizing that, it will be around 5%. Once we get clear from that, when you get out to '23 and beyond, so '23 out to '27, even with the impact of the print churn, we're predicting organic tenant billings growth, north of 5%, and on a normalized basis for that same time period, north of about 6%.
So we are very excited and confident about the future in the U.S. We are seeing some acceleration of gross new biz. We're seeing that today. We expect that to continue, and that really is fueling these very solid organic tenant billings predicted over a long period of time. Again, that's 7 years.
And just a couple of key components here. I'll remind you, 23% or 2/3 of this, 2/3 of this revenue that we need to hit these things are already contracted in our long-term agreements in some of these holistic deals. So that's key. That includes DISH kind of being in here in the assumptions with some modest activity, which potentially could be outperformed, depending on the pace and the level of their network build over that time period. And some of the C-band spectrum deployments for some carriers in some of the years maybe in addition here and outside of kind of the traditional holistic that we're looking for that potentially as an upside.
And then in terms of the co-location amendment mix, we're currently still at heavy amendment, 80% and 20% co-location. That's the way it's been for a little while. It may vary from carrier to carry, but that's what it's been consistently. And we expect that, that will be the case for a couple of years. But going out longer term, it will vary. We do expect that there could be a higher percentage of co-locations than we've traditionally seen as the carriers deploy this higher band spectrum and they have a need to densify their network builds over time. So we're certainly planning for some of that as well, but it's probably too early to predict that too much specificity in terms of what that will be in terms of the mix in the out years. And was there another piece in your question, Batya, that I didn't address?"

Good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all healthy and well.
As is typical on our second quarter call, my remarks today will center on our international business, which now spans more than 171,000 communication sites and accounted for 37% of our Property segment gross margin in the second quarter. Given our recent Telxius transaction, I'll focus much of my commentary on our European portfolio. But I do want to first cover some of the key tenets that drive our global strategy and touch on a few important metrics for our international business as a whole.
Since entering Brazil and Mexico more than 2 decades ago, to provide geographic diversification to our foundational U.S. assets, we've oriented our international growth around partnering with large multinational wireless carriers in select markets with strong property rights, solid rules of law and vibrant wireless industries. Since day 1, our international expansion mandate has been clear, acquire, construct, and market franchise real estate assets to drive strong organic growth, long-term margin expansion and compelling total returns, and do so with an emphasis on building leading market positions in the largest democracies around the world in various stages of wireless technology development, all while driving enhanced connectivity for billions of people and being a good corporate citizen. Bottom line, our goal was to replicate the model we've built in the United States to increase the slope of the growth curve and extend it.
As a result of our adherence to these core principles, and the tremendous contributions from our global leadership teams and employees, we have been able to drive solid results across our international business over the last decade. Markets outside the United States have made meaningful contributions to our long track record of generating strong organic growth, while delivering double-digit annual consolidated AFFO per share growth and attractive returns on invested capital.
In fact, as of the end of the second quarter, international sites that we've owned and operated since before 2010 were generating U.S. NOI yields of 30%, with our oldest vintage of sites in Latin America driving NOI yields closer to 40%. And international sites we've built and acquired since 2010, excluding the Telxius assets that we just closed, are generating an average U.S. dollar NOI yield of 10%, with what we believe to be substantial future upside potential. 
Further, on sites, we've constructed ourselves internationally across all vintages, the NOI yield, as of the end of the second quarter, was 25%, demonstrating the tremendous return potential of our new build program. Finally, it's important to note that just as we've done in the past, we expect to focus on constructing sites for high-quality, primarily investment-grade tenants as we drive toward our goal of 40,000 to 50,000 new builds worldwide over the next 5 years. We're focused not only on generating strong growth and returns internationally, but also in doing so in a sustainable way. This is reflected in our accelerating power-related investments in lithium ion battery storage, solar and other clean energy solutions as we seek to reduce our global carbon footprint and lead the overall telecom industry to a greener, more sustainable future. Moreover, we believe that shared use of renewable energy, combined with storage, has the potential to reduce operating costs over time which can benefit the entire telecom ecosystem as demand for mobile data usage continues to rise.
In addition, we are working to make a positive difference in our markets through programs like our digital communities initiative, which seeks to expand access to education and technology to underserved populations by leveraging power and connectivity at our tower sites. To date, this program has enabled well over 100,000 students across 6 markets to gain critical access to the Internet, while developing digital literacy skills and has recently garnered recognition from the UN World Summit on Information Society.
Looking forward, by working with partners, the World Economic Forum and other stakeholders, we expect to meaningfully expand the reach of our digital communities efforts as part of our overall commitment to making a positive difference in our served markets, particularly given the critical need for pervasive mobile broadband connectivity.
This criticality for broadband connectivity was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and fit squarely within our belief that the network technology evolution we've seen in the United States will be replicated internationally. And that as owners and operators of mission-critical communications real estate, our sites will be at the forefront. As mobile data usage continues to grow rapidly and as 2G and 3G networks outside of the United States are upgraded to 4G and 5G, we expect network densification and augmentation to take center stage resulting in long-term sustainable, predictable growth for us.
Importantly, the international tower model, just like the U.S. business, is predicated on optimizing operating leverage, signing value-additive, strategic long-term contracts and providing high levels of service to our customers, while carefully and selectively deploying capital to high-quality, accretive growth investments.
With mobile network operators across our international markets spending upwards of $35 billion in wireless CapEx annually, and the need for communications infrastructure only expanding, we believe we position ourselves for long-term success.
One critical element of our international strategy is a balanced approach to market selection. We've always sought to not only diversify the business from the perspective of the United States versus international, but also to drive diversification within our international operations themselves. As a result, we operate a mix of developed and developing markets and as I mentioned earlier, have exposure to multiple concurrent technology cycles throughout our operations. We've been quite purposeful in ensuring that we are not too overweight in any one market or region, and that is reflected in our portfolio today.
Our recent Telxius transaction is a clear reflection of this long-held strategy. Not only were we able to secure what we believe to be premier assets centered in 2 highly attractive European countries, but the deal also enabled us to further balance our emerging market presence with communication sites in more mature markets. In fact, on a total company run rate basis, around 60% of our property revenue is now derived from developed technology-advanced markets. We expect the incremental diversification we have gained through the Telxius deal to yield benefits over the long term on many fronts, including with deeper access to the attractive European capital market, both public and private, the addition of incremental euro-denominated revenues and, of course, a much stronger competitive position on the continent itself.
So with that, I'd like to now take a deeper dive into why we're so excited about our European business and particularly our newly scaled presence in Germany and Spain. We've always said that we view the concept of Europe being a singular tower market as a misnomer, and that remains true today. Europe is a collection of vastly different markets with highly variable characteristics, on the regulatory wireless market structure and historical network development site, among others. And we've seen this reflected in many portfolios we've evaluated over the years that we ultimately did not acquire.
To that point, our Telxius transaction is less an indication of a sea change across Europe as a whole and much more a reflection of the assets themselves being superior in our view. The wireless market structure and dynamics, regulatory regimes and carrier CapEx trends in Germany and Spain are favorable, and Telefonica is a high-quality anchor tenant.
We also performed significant due diligence on the sites and accompanying contracts, both on the customer side and on the landlord side, and view the outcome of that diligence as a positive differentiator as compared to some of the other portfolios we've evaluated. As a result, we're confident that we can drive attractive economics across the portfolio, including high margin flow-through from collocation and amendment growth, complemented by a new build program that we expect will further accelerate over the next few years. This confidence is underpinned by strong underlying wireless market trends in both countries.
Mobile data usage from 2019 through '24, for example, is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 25% in Germany and Spain, similar to the United States. Meanwhile, ARPUs have been relatively steady over an extended period of time. The mobile network operators are solidly profitable and 5G device penetration, like in the United States, is still in its infancy. Wireless market structure is also favorable with significant carrier consolidation having already occurred, leading 3 major incoming carriers in Germany and 4 in Spain.
Consequently, we believe the downside risk related to further consolidation in these markets is modest for us. Critically, carriers in both Germany and Spain possess significant spectrum assets across multiple bands. For instance, the 3 incumbents in Germany, along with 1 0 1, all have at least 50 megahertz in the 3.5 to 3.7 gigahertz range, which is now starting to be deployed for 5G rollouts. Meanwhile, in Spain, all 4 major carriers have at least 80 megahertz in the same globally harmonized mid-band range, along with significant spectrum assets from 800 megahertz to 2.1 gigahertz and 700 megahertz spectrum coming to auction shortly.
Further, between the 2 markets, mobile wireless carriers are spending more than $6 billion in wireless CapEx annually, with a new entrant in Germany in accelerating 5G deployments, potentially leading to enhanced CapEx deployment in the future. Finally, over the last several years, and like in many other European markets, communication site counts have been increasing, and we believe that substantial further densification efforts will be necessary to augment existing 4G deployments and upcoming 5G rollouts. Just like in the United States, as higher band spectrum is deployed for 5G, networks will need to become denser to provide a true 5G experience.
With our expanded footprint, focused in the urban areas, where these deployments are likely to be concentrated, we are well positioned to drive strong growth over a number of years. In fact, as we laid out when we announced the transaction, we are confident in being able to deliver organic tenant billings growth at least in the mid-single digits on the European Telxius sites over the next several years and likely beyond. This growth rate trajectory would be roughly 2x what our legacy European business is generating today.
On the surface, that may seem like a disconnect, but peeling back the onion a bit reveals that the math is quite straightforward. In large part, the difference is driven by churn. On our legacy sites, we are working through the impacts of some carrier consolidation. And as a result, our churn rates over the past few years have been in the 2.5% to 3% range.
On the Telxius side, on the other hand, we expect minimal cancellations for the foreseeable future, given most of the existing tenancies represented by Telefonica, with an average noncancelable lease term of between 7 and 8 years. Simply put, even without assuming any inflection in demand from 5G or new entrants, that churn differential alone should put us solidly in the mid-single digits for organic tenant billings growth on the Telxius sites. And to the extent that there is an uptick in activity from 5G and the other dynamics I referenced earlier, we believe that we have the potential to outperform that range over time.
One of the key elements that we expect to backstop this strong growth is the fundamental structure of both our tenant leases of our rooftop and ground leases. This has been a much debated topic across the region, and we've seen a variety of different contract terms in various portfolios that we've evaluated over the years. In many cases, those terms, in our view, were such that future growth and profitability would have been significantly constrained.
This is not the case on the Telxius assets, which was a critical element of why they were so attractive to us. There are revenue shares in place on certain sites, and there are some capacity constraints with respect to a portion of the rooftop assets. But overall, we expect to drive conversion rates on organic growth that will be nearly comparable to what we've seen in the United States, which is extremely important for us.
One additional element of our European business that I want to address is our plans for future expansion. As it is, we believe that we now have the scale we need to be successful in both Germany and Spain. With more than 26,000 sites between the 2 markets, pro forma for the additional German rooftops we expect to close over the next week or so, we are solidly established as a significant player in European communications real estate. Further, we expect to leverage our new build program to drive additional scale over time in the region, including 2,400 or so contracted BTS sites in Germany that we anticipate building over the next 3 to 5 years.
As 4G and 5G-driven densification accelerates, the need for new sites in select markets should continue to grow. On the M&A front, we expect to continue to use our long-standing proven capital deployment -- on our M&A strategy with CDPQ and Allianz joining PGGM as our strategic partners in the region, we believe that we are in a better position than ever to prudently expand the business through M&A, should the right opportunities present themselves. And if not, we will do what we have always done, deploy capital elsewhere on a global basis to drive the best possible risk-adjusted return across the business.
We also believe that our broader European footprint can further enhance the competitive advantage that we derive from our worldwide shared infrastructure platform. Digital transformation on a global scale is being driven by cloud computing and ubiquitous connectivity, and we believe that our existing and future distributed real estate can play a pivotal role in providing mission-critical applications with access to the cloud on-ramps required to support them.
One example of this is on the edge compute side, where a significantly expanded presence in Europe rounds out our position as a global provider of edge compute solutions to support the transition to cloud-native telecom functions. Similar to the United States, we are still years away from deploying meaningful capital and generating significant revenue from edge compute in Germany, Spain and France, but the same long-term trends pointing to a sizable market opportunity in the U.S. also exists in these markets. In addition, we are continuing to explore smart city connectivity, private and shared indoor networks and other innovative next-generation solutions based on WiFi, ORAN and 5G.
In closing, we continue to believe that our comprehensive existing global portfolio and ability to be flexible, strategic and selective with respect to future international growth investments, positions us well for a prolonged period of solid, sustainable growth. With our newly expanded presence in the continent, Europe is going to be a significantly more important component of this path forward. And we're also excited about adding high-quality strategic partners in the region to potentially further enhance our growth profile.
Meanwhile, the rest of our international business spread across attractive markets in various stages of wireless technology deployment, continues to provide meaningful opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth. Taken together with our foundational U.S. asset base, we believe this diverse international portfolio will not only help us drive compelling returns over the long term, but will also enable us to bring critical mobile broadband connectivity to billions of people, advancing our vision of making wireless communications possible everywhere.
With that, let me hand it over to Rod to go through the details of our results and the updated outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are well. 
As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter, driven by solid global demand for our communication sites as carriers continued to deploy meaningful capital to augment and extend their networks. We expect carriers across our global portfolio to spend upwards of $70 billion in CapEx for the full year, which is expected to support attractive growth for our global business.
Before getting into the details of our second quarter results and raised full year outlook, I want to touch on a few key achievements for the quarter. First, we closed on approximately 27,000 sites across Europe and Latin America as part of our Telxius acquisition, and are on track to add the remaining 4,000 or so German rooftop sites in early August.
Overall, including the Telxius deal, other small-scale M&A and our newbuild program, we expanded our global site count by nearly 15% in the quarter. Second, we financed the Telxius transaction in what we believe to be an optimal way, including agreements to add CDPQ and Allianz as strategic minority partners in Europe. We also raised approximately $2.4 billion in the euro debt markets at highly attractive rates and issued more than $2 billion in common equity. We are well positioned to continue to deploy growth capital, while at the same time effectively managing our leverage and maintaining our strong investment-grade balance sheet.
Finally, as expected, demand for both existing and new assets across our global footprint accelerated in the quarter, with sequentially higher organic growth and continued strong new build activity. In addition, we booked a record quarter in our U.S. Services segment, reflecting an attractive demand environment that, combined with our existing comprehensive MLAs, is expected to drive higher levels of gross new business in our Property segment in the coming quarters.
With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our consolidated property revenue of $2.2 billion grew by approximately 18% year-over-year or nearly 16% on an FX-neutral basis. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 24% or 19% on a constant currency basis. These growth rates reflect the advantages of our global diversification and our ability to benefit from multiple concurrent deployments of network technology around the globe.
Growth was also favorably impacted by 1 month of contributions from the Telxius sites. U.S. M&A transactions that closed late in 2020, higher levels of pass-through and straight-line revenue and some nonrecurring elements and revenue reversals.
Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was 4.8%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 70 basis points. This included a step-up in our U.S. and Canada growth from 3.6% last quarter to 4.4% in Q2, driven primarily by the flow-through of activity under our comprehensive MLAs.
We saw a nearly 20% sequential acceleration in the contribution of colocations and amendment activity to organic tenant billings growth. Escalations were over 3% and churn was 1.9%. 5G activity in the marketplace continues to advance, and all of the major U.S. carriers were active in their deployments during the quarter. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we drove organic tenant billings growth of 5.3%, up from 5% last quarter. Latin America led the way with organic tenant billings growth of 8.4%, driven by solid new business commencements in higher escalators, primarily in Brazil.
Organic tenant billings growth across our African markets was 8.2%, including 11% growth in Nigeria where we continue to benefit from an MOA signed last year with a major customer. We also had a solid quarter in Europe, with organic tenant billings growth rising more than 100 basis points sequentially to 4.4%. Notably, our legacy German business drove gross organic growth of more than 8%, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. Meanwhile, in India, we saw an organic tenant billings decline of 1.7%, essentially flat to the first quarter. This included fairly healthy gross new business activity, but also continued elevated levels of churn.
Turning to Slide 7. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 22% or around 20% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.2%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, driven by continued organic growth, prudent cost controls throughout the business and benefits from higher levels of straight-line revenues. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.7%. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was nearly 19%, with per share growth of about 17%. Continued solid organic trends, contributions from our newly acquired and constructed assets and cost controls throughout the business, along with cost efficient balance sheet management and about $20 million in FX favorability, were the main drivers of this growth.
On an FX neutral basis, consolidated AFFO growth would have been over 16%, and consolidated AFFO per share growth would have been around 15%. AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share was $2.39, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of right around 19%. 
Let's now turn to our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, we have layered in the impacts of the more than 27,000 Telxius sites we have closed to date as well as the remaining 4,000 Telxius rooftop sites in Germany that we expect to purchase in the first week of August.
Second, we have assumed that our agreements with CDPQ and Allianz closed in mid-Q3. We expect to receive over $3 billion in total proceeds from these transactions. And after the closing, CDPQ will own 30% of ATC Europe, with Allianz owning 18%. This is higher than the initial 10% that we discussed as Allianz has exercised its option to increase its stake in the business.
Additionally, PGGM has converted its prior holdings in ATC Europe to minority stakes in our local German and Spanish operating companies. Given this more meaningful minority interest component, we have added net income attributable to AMT common stockholders and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders as outlook metrics and would expect to feature both in our financial reporting going forward.
Finally, as a result of recent favorable FX trends in many of our markets, our current outlook reflects positive FX impacts of $41 million for property revenue, $26 million for adjusted EBITDA and $20 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations.
With that, let's move to the details of our increased full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint, up 6% versus our prior outlook. The increase includes approximately $383 million in total revenue from Telxius, including $141 million in pass-through. Further, we now expect about $58 million in additional pass-through revenue throughout the rest of the business, mostly due to higher fuel prices in India as well as $19 million or so in higher global straight-line revenue.
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that as part of our property revenue outlook increase, we are raising our organic tenant billings growth projections on a consolidated basis to around 4%, up from between 3% and 4% previously as a result of higher growth expectations internationally. In the U.S., we're maintaining our projections for approximately 3% organic tenant billings growth, including the impacts of Sprint churn in Q4. We continue to expect 5G deployments to drive accelerating gross new business activity and believe we have a long runway of solid growth ahead of us as carriers invest in network densification over a multiyear period.
In Latin America, we're raising our organic tenant billings growth expectations to over 7% for the year, as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments despite some continued challenges associated with COVID-19. As compared to our prior outlook, we now expect slightly lower churn across the region, although we do still expect churn to trend higher in the back half of the year as some carrier consolidation occurs in markets like Mexico.
We continue to drive value additive contractual arrangements in the region and recently signed a significant colocation deal with a major customer in Colombia, which we expect to inflect growth higher in that market in the coming quarters.
Meanwhile, in Africa, we are reaffirming our expectations of organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8% as we continue to see encouraging leasing trends in the region. As I alluded to earlier, growth rates in Nigeria are especially strong, where we are continuing to benefit from an MLA signed last year with a major customer. This, along with solid trends in other African markets, are expected to drive an acceleration in regional organic tenant billings growth to above 9% in the second half of the year.
Moving on to Europe. We now expect organic tenant billings growth of over 5% for the full year, up around 150 basis points versus our prior outlook. This is being driven primarily by 2 factors. First, we expect higher levels of gross new business in our legacy Europe business, where we're continuing to see strong 5G-driven activity, particularly in Germany. Organic tenant billings growth for our legacy European assets is now expected to come in at above 4%, up more than 50 basis points as compared to our prior expectations.
And second, the colocation and amendment growth that we expect to see in the second half of the year on the Telxius assets, which is included in our organic tenant billings growth metric, is driving another 100 basis points or so of upside. We view this expected activity as reinforcing our long-term expectations for compelling growth on the Telxius assets.
Finally, in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. We are seeing encouraging levels of gross activity in the market but also continued elevated levels of churn. And while we remain optimistic that the market will return to solid growth over the long term, we're not expecting a significant inflection point in growth in 2021, which is consistent with our prior outlook.
Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 15%, including a $183 million contribution from the Telxius assets, roughly $26 million in positive translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook and about $20 million in higher net straight line. In addition, we now expect $25 million in incremental expected services gross margin as services activity in the U.S. continues to outstrip our expectations.
For the year, we expect to book roughly $105 million in services operating profit from total services revenue of $220 million. These positive items are being partially offset by roughly $30 million in incremental bad debt assumed for the full year, the majority of which is in India.
Overall collections trends in the market remain solid, but we are taking a slightly more conservative approach for the back half of the year within our projections. The remaining bad debt is focused in Mexico, where Altan has recently filed for the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Given its government backing and recent progress within the business, we remain optimistic on the prospects of collecting billings with Altan in full. But because we expect the collections to be slow, we have made the bad debt entries for now, consistent with our historical approach in similar instances.
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 14%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.50 per share. The flow-through of incremental cash adjusted EBITDA as well as around $20 million in FX tailwinds are being offset by approximately $15 million, $31 million and $25 million in incremental maintenance CapEx, cash taxes and net cash interest expense, respectively, primarily driven by the Telxius transaction. On a per share basis, we now expect growth of right around 12% for the year.
Finally, AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 10% versus 2020. This takes into account the expected closing of our transactions with CDPQ and Allianz in mid-Q3 and the corresponding minority interest impacts. The growth rates for the attributable metric is about 2% lower than our projected consolidated AFFO per share growth, primarily due to the fact that the onetime cash interest expense item associated with our prior African joint venture in 2020 did not apply to the AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders. Notably, across both of these metrics, we are well positioned to meet our target of driving double-digit growth for 2021.
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our updated capital deployment expectations for 2021, which now contemplates the Telxius transaction and reflect our consistent focus on driving strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share. 
First, we continue to expect to dedicate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15%, subject to Board approval. With regards to CapEx, we are raising our overall projections by $125 million at the midpoint. This includes around $65 million in startup CapEx attributable to the Telxius sites as well as $65 million in additional deployment CapEx as part of our revised expectations of constructing 7,000 sites this year, up from our previous outlook of 6,500.
We continue to drive highly attractive returns through our program. And including our revised 2021 expectations, we have added around 24,000 new sites since 2016. Notably, our average day 1 NOI yields on build so far this year have been 11%. We are also adding $15 million in maintenance CapEx as we are accelerating a few maintenance projects over the rest of the year. This is being partially offset by about $20 million in lower anticipated land CapEx.
On the acquisition front, we have deployed just under $9 billion so far this year, primarily on the Telxius transaction, and expect to spend another $600 million in early August to purchase the remaining 4,000 Telxius rooftop sites located in Germany. Of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, over 80% is composed of discretionary CapEx in M&A.
On the debt side of the equation, we ended the second quarter with net leverage of 5.7x and expect that metric to trend down into the mid-5x range after closing the CDPQ and Allianz stake sales. We remain firmly committed to our investment grade rating and continue to expect that solid long-term adjusted EBITDA growth will allow us to naturally delever to the upper end of our 3 to 5x range over a multiyear period. Over the next few quarters, we expect to be opportunistic in evaluating the potential benefits of terming out a portion of our floating rate debt to long-term fixed-rate instruments as we continually work to optimize our balance sheet. Looking back over the last decade, we have utilized this strategy to essentially reduce our weighted average cost of debt by half to 2.4% as of Q2. 
Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a few minutes to highlight several elements of our disciplined capital deployment strategy, honing in on 2 international regions where we have been quite active recently, Europe and Africa.
Since the end of 2019, our most transformational international investments have been in Africa, through our acquisition of Eaton Towers, and most recently in Europe through the Telxius deal. As the chart to the left shows, organic co-locations and amendment contributions in both regions have been accelerating. More importantly, we expect gross colocation and amendment activity to remain at elevated levels over a multiyear period, positioning us well to drive strong growth and attractive returns across our recently acquired assets in both regions.
In addition to acquiring high-quality strategic site portfolios, we have also been ramping up our new build programs across both regions, as you can see in the middle chart on the slide. In fact, we've gone from constructing an average of less than 100 sites annually back in the early 2010 to a forecast of around 1,600 sites in 2021, primarily in Africa, Importantly, the return characteristics of these builds have remained extremely attractive, with average day 1 NOI yields of approximately 10% expected this year. As you can also see, yields have risen sharply on older vintages of new build sites as a result of the strong lease-up trends I just mentioned, and we expect to continue to drive meaningful colocation and amendment revenue on our new build sites in the future.
Further, we continue to focus on building and leasing sites to high-quality, large investment-grade tenants who we believe will drive the bulk of the network investments in these regions for the foreseeable future. We anticipate the demand for new builds across Africa and also in Europe, where we have inherited a robust pipeline with Telefonica as part of the Telxius acquisition, to remain strong as carriers address their coverage and capacity needs to meet 4G and 5G demand.
We are also focused on growing our business sustainably, while driving industry leadership and innovation. A perfect example of this is what we've been doing in Africa with energy efficiency and renewable energy, where, by the end of 2021, we will have invested upwards of $250 million on lithium-ion batteries, solar power solutions and other energy-efficient technology. While we are still fairly early in the overall progression of these investments, the initial results have been compelling, with average diesel consumption per site declining by around 35%, coupled with improved battery and generator efficiency and elevated uptime levels that we believe are best-in-class. Through these initiatives, not only are we earning an attractive return on investment, but we are also helping to build and enhance a sustainable global digital ecosystem.
This approach to capital deployment in Africa and Europe is indicative of our overall global investment philosophy. We continue to look for compelling opportunities to deploy capital in responsible, sustainable ways where we can generate attractive, long-term returns and solid growth while partnering with large multinational mobile network operators as they bring enhanced connectivity to their customers. And we believe that the global diversification that we've built into the business will benefit us for years to come.
Finally, on Slide 14 and in summary, Q2 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, meaningful new build activity and consistent dividend growth. This was achieved while closing on and beginning to integrate the vast majority of our Telxius acquisition, issuing over $2 billion in euro-denominated debt at record low rates, completing a successful common equity issuance and partnering with 2 world-class strategic investors in CDPQ and Allianz.
For all of this, I'd like to offer a huge thank you to our nearly 6,000 global employees, including those who have recently joined us from Telxius. Their hard work, unwavering dedication and numerous talents have positioned us extremely well to continue driving compelling total returns for our stockholders. We look forward to finishing 2021 strong and are more excited than ever about our long-term growth trajectory based on the continuing global rise in mobile data demand and our durable competitive advantage throughout our served markets.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean, we do have a lot of experience with these types of transactions. But I'm really proud of the teams working through, obviously, a different -- difficult pandemic in terms of getting things done. But all early signs are really positive for us.
The people, the teams, the expertise, you've seen some of the outer size even results in the quarter and the expectation for the year as a result of what we're seeing in both of those critical markets. I mean for us, from a European perspective, the TAM is large. We see new spectrum being deployed. So 5G growth is strong.
The organic growth that we see in particularly even in Germany, is stronger than we originally even had thought. And from a portfolio perspective, we have done a lot of due diligence, as I mentioned, and as Rod mentioned on the sites themselves, we know them quite well. And they're continuing to perform just like we thought.
So as I said in my remarks, in our view, this was the best portfolio there with a really solid, high-quality anchor tenant. So everything is going very, very well for us, and we're expecting a good strong year. And then obviously, strength going into '22, I think the organic billings growth is going to continue to uptick. And it will be stronger out of the back end of this year, leading us into providing great foundation for growth in '22. So really all very positive.
On the private network side, we continue to look at a number of different initiatives, utilizing different spectrum. And so I don't know how quickly they're going to be rolled out candidly, Simon, and we were participating. As I said, we have a sizable group looking at what the opportunity could be. We have significant DAS networks as you well know. And we're really looking at how can we migrate them to kind of the next technology. We'd like to be able to lower the overall cost in the venues that we're in. And so we're looking at available spectrum and looking at technology, but we're still really in the early stages of that deployment. We're in the CBRS Allianz is as you well know, and taking advantage of that knowledge and seeing whether there are opportunities leveraging that technology, that spectrum, to be able to even increase the overall value proposition that we have for our customers."

When you look at the full year in terms of the gross new business that we expect to drive in the U.S. on an incremental monthly run rate, we expect that to be more than a 20%, 25% growth rate for the U.S. So we expect that kind of monthly run rate addition to be strong. It is broad-based. So we see activities through all the carriers.
The one thing that I would point out is with DISH, we will see revenue from their activity on our organic tenant billings really begin to impact the numbers in 2022, not so much in 2021, but they're certainly out active doing the planning for their network. They're active in our services business, which you saw the numbers this morning. We're increasing our services outlook to $220 million. That's up again from our prior outlook of $175 million, which was up from our original $120 million. So that's the early indication of where you're seeing that level of activity. 
But we're excited about what we see in the U.S. We're excited about that incremental monthly run rate gross growth of north of 25%. And we do think that given the new C-band spectrum and everything that's going on, that we're at the beginning of a multiyear stretch of activity that we expect to see in the U.S."

But I can tell you that the pension funds, infra funds there is an extensive amount of capital that's available in all of the markets that we're servicing. So yes, it is there, and we'll take a look at whether it makes sense for us, whether they're the right partners for us our intent here on looking and diversifying the pools of capital that we're using is to provide a platform for us to be able to expand and expand aggressively if it makes sense to do so.
And so in Europe, we've set ourselves up with, I think, really solid partners in the marketplace, and it really provides a very efficient platform for us to be able to expand. Now the transactions need to be there and they need to make sense for us and all of those things. But having those kinds of partners and that kind of capital available really, I think, is a -- helps us significantly in terms of being able to expand in those areas quickly.
And with regards to Brazil, Brazil -- and I do a shout out to our teams in Brazil because we think that the splitting of the Oi portfolio is going to be a long-term positive for the marketplace. Candidly, there are better funded carriers that picked up those particular assets and rationalized the portfolio is down there quite a bit. And now the spectrum is in the hands of entities, our customers and the market that really want to deploy it and really want to advance the technology deployments in the marketplace.
So we think it's that particular transaction event in the marketplace was a net positive for us. And as I said, I remain really optimistic on the opportunities in the marketplace and the way our teams are really taking advantage of it."

Tim, again, on the private capital. we looked at the private capital is a very cost-effective way of aligning ourselves to very attractive partners with deep pools of cash to be able to position us and provide us with a platform for some sizable growth going forward. Now -- and that's not an indication that we've got the deals in the hopper that we're ready to roll on. But there are some significant portfolios in the marketplace that may make sense for us going forward. We'll look at each one individually and whether it does. But having that pool of capital makes sense from a diversification perspective.
I'm big on diversification. As you can see through our portfolio, we have a very broad sense of diversification between U.S. and international and within international with developed and developing markets. And I think that rule proves true for forms of capital. that we want to ensure that we've got access in all different forms of capital that's available to us and take advantage of that going forward. So that's really it, I think, on the capital side.
On the active versus passive, we've been very successful on the passive side of this. And our intent is to try to continue to stay in that type of a role and leverage that kind of a model. There are certain elements on the active side that we are involved with. Power, for example. We have a number of initiatives in many of our -- actually all of our markets from a power perspective, some on the primary power side, where we're the primary supplier of power in markets like Africa and India.
And so from that standpoint, we are part of the kind of the active management of ensuring that their networks are running properly. And we've done -- as Rod pointed out, we've done some significant investment in areas, whether it's in solar or lithium to be able to improve our capabilities and to be able to offer that value to our customers as well as generate value for ourselves as well as generate value for -- from an eco perspective in those markets and really provide kind of a sustainable platform going forward.
We're also very involved in the secondary power side. You look at the United States, for example, in our developed markets. We have thousands of generators in those markets. and providing secondary power and backup for our customers there. And we're even looking from a power perspective is kind of a virtual power source from a storage perspective that we might be able to provide, particularly in our international markets, as we continue to really leverage solar as well as lithium-ion.
We are even exploring with wind. We have sites there that have solar panels where we've deployed 50,000 to 60,000 panels in the region, and we've got wind turbine. So we're trialing a lot of different things, and we're working with a number of different external parties to really be able to leverage their expertise.
But when you start to get up into the real active side of the network, as I said, we have really tried to -- and we'll continue to do so. Our customers are looking for more involvement in that area. But that hasn't been our strength going there. 
And -- but I mean, to the extent that there are opportunities, and they make sense for us and we get the right resources and talent to be able to do so, we'll look at it. But that's not part of our major strategy right now."

So in the U.S., we are projecting organic tenant billings growth right in that 3% range. It's been consistent, so we did not change that in the outlook.
And I'll just highlight a couple of things. The first one is we are seeing an acceleration in activity in colocation and amendment in the U.S. that we're very excited about, but that acceleration was contemplated when we executed the MLAs that we have in place. So a lot of that activity is kind of built, in price and within our guidance. So we think, certainly for this year, it's very stable. We also gave longer-term guidance for the U.S., which you can go back and refer to.
A lot in that guidance, you can see that the growth rates in the U.S. are accelerating over the next several years. [indiscernible] things for this churn. So the other point that I would make is we do have the Sprint churn that will begin to roll off in Q4 of this year. The largest effect -- a single year effect that we'll see from that will be in 2022. It will continue out to 2024. So there'll be 4 years of kind of sprint churn. And again, the biggest impact will be in 2022.
But you'll see it in our numbers in the end of this year, but that's all baked within our 3% organic tenant billings outlook. So we couldn't be more excited about the U.S. and its trajectory going forward. And once we get through the Sprint churn or expecting kind of an acceleration. And again, I would ask you to go back and refer to our longer-term guidance, and you'll see what I'm referring to in terms of the outlook and the acceleration in overall organic growth that we are expecting over the long term."

Number one is they do have a remaining term on the leases that's quite long. So we have about 6 years remaining on all their leases. They might make up about 9% of Mexico revenue. And so that's kind of the size that they are in terms of the business there. And it's less than 1%, close to 0.5% of the overall company revenue.

Let me highlight here. In terms of our longer-term guidance, I don't want to get into the specifics around DISH and any specific contract terms, but they were in our longer-term guidance. So what we laid out was organic tenant billings growth of at least 4% on average over the next 7 years. That encompasses 2021 out through 2027. If you normalize that for the Sprint churn, it goes up to about 5%. 
There are 2 in chunks there in terms of time periods. If you isolate the 2021 and 2022 time period, we're looking at an average organic growth rate of about 2% in the U.S., including the Sprint churn that we've all discussed. Normalizing for that, it would be up around 5%. If you take that next step out to 2023, to 2027, we're projecting greater than 5%, even with the residual churn from Sprint and normalize for that, we're projecting greater than 6% growth between 2023 and 2027. 
So DISH is in there. We're building sites for them today. Revenue will start for them in 2022 and ramp over the next few years. They're in that longer-term guidance, and you can see that longer-term guidance is higher in the out years. than it is in the early years because we do expect to see acceleration in a build there as the carriers build out 5G kind of across the U.S. and deploy the new spectrum."

Good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all healthy and well. 
As is typical on our second quarter calls, my remarks today will center on our international business, which now spans more than 171,000 communication sites and accounted for 37% of our property segment gross margin in the second quarter. Given our recent Telxius transaction, I'll focus much of my commentary on our European portfolio, but I do want to first cover some of the key tenets that drive our global strategy and touch on a few important metrics for our international business as a whole. 
Since entering Brazil and Mexico more than 2 decades ago, to provide geographic diversification to our foundational U.S. assets, we've oriented our international growth around partnering with large multinational wireless carriers in select markets with strong property rights, solid rules of law and vibrant wireless industries. 
Since day 1, our international expansion mandate has been clear: acquire, construct, and market franchise real estate assets to drive strong organic growth, long-term margin expansion and compelling total returns and do so with an emphasis on building leading market positions in the largest democracies around the world in various stages of wireless technology development, all while driving enhanced connectivity for billions of people and being a good corporate citizen. Bottom line, our goal was to replicate the model we've built in the United States, to increase the slope of the growth curve and extend it. 
As a result of our adherence to these core principles and the tremendous contributions from our global leadership teams and employees, we have been able to drive solid results across our international business over the last decade. Markets outside the United States have made meaningful contributions to our long track record of generating strong organic growth, while delivering double-digit annual consolidated AFFO per share growth and attractive returns on invested capital. 
In fact, as of the end of the second quarter, international sites that we've owned and operated since before 2010 were generating U.S. dollar NOI yields of 30%, with our oldest vintage of sites in Latin America driving NOI yields closer to 40%. And international sites we've built and acquired since 2010, excluding the Telxius assets that we just closed, are generating an average U.S. dollar NOI yield of 10%, with what we believe to be substantial future upside potential. 
Further, on sites, we've constructed ourselves internationally across all vintages, the NOI yield, as of the end of the second quarter was 25%, demonstrating the tremendous return potential of our new build program. Finally, it's important to note that just as we've done in the past, we expect to focus on constructing sites for high-quality, primarily investment-grade tenants as we drive toward our goal of 40,000 to 50,000 new builds worldwide over the next 5 years. 
We're focused not only on generating strong growth and returns internationally, but also in doing so in a sustainable way. This is reflected in our accelerating power-related investments in lithium ion battery storage, solar and other clean energy solutions as we seek to reduce our global carbon footprint and lead the overall telecom industry to a greener, more sustainable future. Moreover, we believe that shared use of renewable energy, combined with storage, has the potential to reduce operating costs over time, which can benefit the entire telecom ecosystem as demand for mobile data usage continues to rise. 
In addition, we are working to make a positive difference in our markets through programs like our digital communities initiative, which seeks to expand access to education and technology to underserved populations by leveraging power and connectivity at our tower sites. To date, this program has enabled well over 100,000 students across 6 markets to gain critical access to the Internet, while developing digital literacy skills and has recently garnered recognition from the UN World Summit on Information Society. 
Looking forward, by working with partners, the World Economic Forum and other stakeholders, we expect to meaningfully expand the reach of our digital communities efforts as part of our overall commitment to making a positive difference in our served markets, particularly given the critical need for pervasive mobile broadband connectivity. 
This criticality for broadband connectivity was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and fit squarely within our belief that the network technology evolution we've seen in the United States will be replicated internationally. And that as owners and operators of mission-critical communications real estate, our sites will be at the forefront. As mobile data usage continues to grow rapidly and as 2G and 3G networks outside of the United States are upgraded to 4G and 5G, we expect network densification and augmentation to take center stage resulting in long-term sustainable, predictable growth for us. 
Importantly, the international tower model, just like the U.S. business, is predicated on optimizing operating leverage, signing value-additive, strategic long-term contracts and providing high levels of service to our customers, while carefully and selectively deploying capital to high-quality, accretive growth investments. 
With mobile network operators across our international markets spending upwards of $35 billion in wireless CapEx annually, and the need for communications infrastructure only expanding, we believe we position ourselves for long-term success. 
One critical element of our international strategy is a balanced approach to market selection. We've always sought to not only diversify the business from the perspective of the United States versus international, but also to drive diversification within our international operations themselves. As a result, we operate in a mix of developed and developing markets and as I mentioned earlier, have exposure to multiple concurrent technology cycles throughout our operations. We've been quite purposeful in ensuring that we are not too overweight in any one market or region, and that is reflected in our portfolio today. 
Our recent Telxius transaction is a clear reflection of this long-held strategy. Not only were we able to secure what we believe to be premier assets centered in 2 highly attractive European countries, but the deal also enabled us to further balance our emerging market presence with communication sites in more mature markets. In fact, on a total company run rate basis, around 60% of our property revenue is now derived from developed technology-advanced markets. We expect the incremental diversification we have gained through the Telxius deal to yield benefits over the long term on many fronts, including with deeper access to the attractive European capital market, both public and private, the addition of incremental euro-denominated revenues and, of course, a much stronger competitive position on the continent itself. 
So with that, I'd like to now take a deeper dive into why we're so excited about our European business and particularly our newly scaled presence in Germany and Spain. We've always said that we view the concept of Europe being a singular tower market as a misnomer, and that remains true today. Europe is a collection of vastly different markets with highly variable characteristics on the regulatory wireless market structure and historical network development sides, among others. And we've seen this reflected in many portfolios we've evaluated over the years that we ultimately did not acquire. 
To that point, our Telxius transaction is less an indication of a sea change across Europe as a whole and much more a reflection of the assets themselves being superior in our view. The wireless market structure and dynamics, regulatory regimes and carrier CapEx trends in Germany and Spain are favorable, and Telefónica is a high-quality anchor tenant. 
We also perform significant due diligence on the sites and accompanying contracts, both on the customer side and on the landlord side, and view the outcome of that diligence as a positive differentiator as compared to some of the other portfolios we've evaluated. As a result, we're confident that we can drive attractive economics across the portfolio, including high margin flow-through from colocation and amendment growth, complemented by a new build program that we expect will further accelerate over the next few years. 
This confidence is underpinned by strong underlying wireless market trends in both countries. Mobile data usage from 2019 through '24, for example, is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 25% in Germany and Spain, similar to the United States. Meanwhile, ARPUs have been relatively steady over an extended period of time. The mobile network operators are solidly profitable and 5G device penetration, like in the United States, is still in its infancy. Wireless market structure is also favorable, with significant carrier consolidation having already occurred, leading 3 major incoming carriers in Germany and 4 in Spain. 
Consequently, we believe the downside risk related to further consolidation in these markets is modest for us. Critically, carriers in both Germany and Spain possess significant spectrum assets across multiple bands. For instance, the 3 incumbents in Germany, along with 1&1, all have at least 50 megahertz in the 3.5 to 3.7 gigahertz range, which is now starting to be deployed for 5G rollouts. Meanwhile, in Spain, all 4 major carriers have at least 80 megahertz in the same globally harmonized mid-band range, along with significant spectrum assets from 800 megahertz to 2.1 gigahertz and 700 megahertz spectrum coming to auction shortly. 
Further, between the 2 markets, mobile wireless carriers are spending more than $6 billion in wireless CapEx annually, with a new entrant in Germany in accelerating 5G deployments potentially leading to enhanced CapEx deployment in the future. Finally, over the last several years, unlike in many other European markets, communication site counts have been increasing, and we believe that substantial further densification efforts will be necessary to augment existing 4G deployments and upcoming 5G rollouts. Just like in the United States, as higher band spectrum is deployed for 5G, networks will need to become denser to provide a true 5G experience. 
With our expanded footprint focused in the urban areas where these deployments are likely to be concentrated, we are well positioned to drive strong growth over a number of years. In fact, as we laid out when we announced the transaction, we are confident in being able to deliver organic tenant billings growth at least in the mid-single digits on the European Telxius sites over the next several years and likely beyond. This growth rate trajectory would be roughly 2x what our legacy European business is generating today. 
On the surface, that may seem like a disconnect, but peeling back the onion a bit reveals that the math is quite straightforward. In large part, the difference is driven by churn. On our legacy sites, we are working through the impacts of some carrier consolidation. And as a result, our churn rates over the past few years have been in the 2.5% to 3% range. 
On the Telxius side, on the other hand, we expect minimal cancellations for the foreseeable future, given most of the existing tenancies represented by Telefónica, with an average noncancelable lease term of between 7 and 8 years. Simply put, even without assuming any inflection in demand from 5G or new entrants, that churn differential alone should put us solidly in the mid-single digits for organic tenant billings growth on the Telxius sites. And to the extent that there is an uptick in activity from 5G and the other dynamics I referenced earlier, we believe that we have the potential to outperform that range over time. 
One of the key elements that we expect to backstop this strong growth is the fundamental structure of both our tenant leases of our rooftop and ground leases. This has been a much debated topic across the region, and we've seen a variety of different contract terms in various portfolios that we've evaluated over the years. 
In many cases, those terms, in our view, were such that future growth and profitability would have been significantly constrained. This is not the case on the Telxius assets, which was a critical element of why they were so attractive to us. There are revenue shares in place on certain sites, and there are some capacity constraints with respect to a portion of the rooftop assets. But overall, we expect to drive conversion rates on organic growth that will be nearly comparable to what we've seen in the United States, which is extremely important for us. 
One additional element of our European business that I want to address is our plans for future expansion. As it is, we believe that we now have the scale we need to be successful in both Germany and Spain. With more than 26,000 sites between the 2 markets, pro forma for the additional German rooftops we expect to close over the next week or so, we are solidly established as a significant player in European communications real estate. Further, we expect to leverage our new build program to drive additional scale over time in the region, including 2,400 or so contracted BTS sites in Germany that we anticipate building over the next 3 to 5 years. 
As 4G and 5G-driven densification accelerates, the need for new sites in select markets should continue to grow. On the M&A front, we expect to continue to use our long-standing proven capital deployment methodology to evaluate potential transactions in the future. We have been patient, deliberate and selective in Europe to this point, and that will continue going forward. Each portfolio will be examined on its own merits, with long-term growth potential, AFFO per share accretion and long-term return on invested capital continuing to guide our M&A strategy. 
With CDPQ and Allianz joining PGGM as our strategic partners in the region, we believe that we are in a better position than ever to prudently expand the business through M&A, should the right opportunities present themselves. And if not, we will do what we have always done, deploy capital elsewhere on a global basis to drive the best possible risk-adjusted return across the business. 
We also believe that our broader European footprint can further enhance the competitive advantage that we derive from our worldwide shared infrastructure platform. Digital transformation on a global scale is being driven by cloud computing and ubiquitous connectivity, and we believe that our existing and future distributed real estate can play a pivotal role in providing mission-critical applications with access to the cloud on-ramps required to support them.
One example of this is on-the-edge compute side, where a significantly expanded presence in Europe rounds out our position as a global provider of edge compute solutions to support the transition to cloud-native telecom functions. Similar to the United States, we are still years away from deploying meaningful capital and generating significant revenue from edge compute in Germany, Spain and France. But the same long-term trends pointing to a sizable market opportunity in the U.S. also exists in these markets. In addition, we are continuing to explore smart city connectivity, private and shared indoor networks and other innovative next-generation solutions based on WiFi, O-RAN and 5G. 
In closing, we continue to believe that our comprehensive existing global portfolio and ability to be flexible, strategic and selective with respect to future international growth investments, positions us well for a prolonged period of solid, sustainable growth. With our newly expanded presence in the continent, Europe is going to be a significantly more important component of this path forward. And we're also excited about adding high-quality strategic partners in the region to potentially further enhance our growth profile. 
Meanwhile, the rest of our international business, spread across attractive markets in various stages of wireless technology deployment continues to provide meaningful opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth. Taken together with our foundational U.S. asset base, we believe this diverse international portfolio will not only help us drive compelling returns over the long term, but will also enable us to bring critical mobile broadband connectivity to billions of people, advancing our vision of making wireless communications possible everywhere.
With that, let me hand it over to Rod to go through the details of our results and the updated outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are well. 
As you saw in our press release, we had a strong second quarter, driven by solid global demand for our communication sites as carriers continued to deploy meaningful capital to augment and extend their networks. We expect carriers across our global portfolio to spend upwards of $70 billion in CapEx for the full year, which is expected to support attractive growth for our global business. 
Before getting into the details of our second quarter results and raised full year outlook, I want to touch on a few key achievements for the quarter. First, we closed on approximately 27,000 sites across Europe and Latin America as part of our Telxius acquisition, and are on track to add the remaining 4,000 or so German rooftop sites in early August. 
Overall, including the Telxius deal, other small-scale M&A and our new build program, we expanded our global site count by nearly 15% in the quarter. Second, we financed the Telxius transaction in what we believe to be an optimal way, including agreements to add CDPQ and Allianz as strategic minority partners in Europe. 
We also raised approximately $2.4 billion in the euro debt markets at highly attractive rates and issued more than $2 billion in common equity. We are well positioned to continue to deploy growth capital, while at the same time effectively managing our leverage and maintaining our strong investment-grade balance sheet. 
Finally, as expected, demand for both existing and new assets across our global footprint accelerated in the quarter, with sequentially higher organic growth and continued strong new build activity. In addition, we booked a record quarter in our U.S. services segment, reflecting an attractive demand environment that, combined with our existing comprehensive MLAs, is expected to drive higher levels of gross new business in our property segment in the coming quarters. 
With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q2 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. As you can see, our consolidated property revenue of $2.2 billion grew by approximately 18% year-over-year or nearly 16% on an FX-neutral basis. This included U.S. property revenue growth of 13% and international property revenue growth of 24% or 19% on a constant currency basis. 
These growth rates reflect the advantages of our global diversification and our ability to benefit from multiple concurrent deployments of network technology around the globe. Growth was also favorably impacted by 1 month of contributions from the Telxius sites, U.S. M&A transactions that closed late in 2020, higher levels of pass-through and straight-line revenue and some nonrecurring elements and revenue reserve -- reversals. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, organic growth was again a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was 4.8%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 70 basis points. This included a step-up in our U.S. and Canada growth from 3.6% last quarter to 4.4% in Q2, driven primarily by the flow-through of activity under our comprehensive MLAs. 
We saw a nearly 20% sequential acceleration in the contribution of colocations and amendment activity to organic tenant billings growth. Escalations were over 3% and churn was 1.9%. 5G activity in the marketplace continues to advance, and all of the major U.S. carriers were active in their deployments during the quarter. 
Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we drove organic tenant billings growth of 5.3%, up from 5% last quarter. Latin America led the way with organic tenant billings growth of 8.4%, driven by solid new business commencements in higher escalators, primarily in Brazil. 
Organic tenant billings growth across our African markets was 8.2%, including 11% growth in Nigeria where we continue to benefit from an MOA signed last year with a major customer. We also had a solid quarter in Europe, with organic tenant billings growth rising more than 100 basis points sequentially to 4.4%. Notably, our legacy German business drove gross organic growth of more than 8%, driven by accelerating 5G deployments and continuing investments in 4G. Meanwhile, in India, we saw an organic tenant billings decline of 1.7%, essentially flat to the first quarter. This included fairly healthy gross new business activity, but also continued elevated levels of churn. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 22% or around 20% on an FX-neutral basis to $1.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 64.2%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, driven by continued organic growth, prudent cost controls throughout the business and benefits from higher levels of straight-line revenues. Cash, SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.7%. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was nearly 19%, with per share growth of about 17%. Continued solid organic trends, contributions from our newly acquired and constructed assets and cost controls throughout the business, along with cost efficient balance sheet management and about $20 million in FX favorability, were the main drivers of this growth. 
On an FX neutral basis, consolidated AFFO growth would have been over 16%, and consolidated AFFO per share growth would have been around 15%. AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share was $2.39, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of right around 19%. 
Let's now turn to our raised outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, we have layered in the impacts of the more than 27,000 Telxius sites we have closed to date as well as the remaining 4,000 Telxius rooftop sites in Germany that we expect to purchase in the first week of August. 
Second, we have assumed that our agreements with CDPQ and Allianz close in mid-Q3. We expect to receive over $3 billion in total proceeds from these transactions. And after the closing, CDPQ will own 30% of ATC Europe, with Allianz owning 18%. This is higher than the initial 10% that we discussed as Allianz has exercised its option to increase its stake in the business. 
Additionally, PGGM has converted its prior holdings in ATC Europe to minority stakes in our local German and Spanish operating companies. Given this more meaningful minority interest component, we have added net income attributable to AMT common stockholders and AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders as outlook metrics and would expect to feature both in our financial reporting going forward. 
Finally, as a result of recent favorable FX trends in many of our markets, our current outlook reflects positive FX impacts of $41 million for property revenue, $26 million for adjusted EBITDA and $20 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. 
With that, let's move to the details of our increased full year expectations. As you can see on Slide 8, we are now projecting consolidated year-over-year property revenue growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint, up 6% versus our prior outlook. The increase includes approximately $383 million in total revenue from Telxius, including $141 million in pass-through. Further, we now expect about $58 million in additional pass-through revenue throughout the rest of the business, mostly due to higher fuel prices in India as well as $19 million or so in higher global straight-line revenue. 
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that as part of our property revenue outlook increase, we are raising our organic tenant billings growth projections on a consolidated basis to around 4%, up from between 3% and 4% previously as a result of higher growth expectations internationally. 
In the U.S., we're maintaining our projections for approximately 3% organic tenant billings growth, including the impacts of Sprint churn in Q4. We continue to expect 5G deployments to drive accelerating gross new business activity and believe we have a long runway of solid growth ahead of us as carriers invest in network densification over a multiyear period. 
In Latin America, we're raising our organic tenant billings growth expectations to over 7% for the year, as customers continue to increase their mobile data usage and carriers respond with incremental network investments despite some continued challenges associated with COVID-19. As compared to our prior outlook, we now expect slightly lower churn across the region, although we do still expect churn to trend higher in the back half of the year as some carrier consolidation occurs in markets like Mexico. We continue to drive value additive contractual arrangements in the region and recently signed a significant colocation deal with a major customer in Colombia, which we expect to inflect growth higher in that market in the coming quarters. 
Meanwhile, in Africa, we are reaffirming our expectations of organic tenant billings growth in excess of 8% as we continue to see encouraging leasing trends in the region. As I alluded to earlier, growth rates in Nigeria are especially strong, where we are continuing to benefit from an MLA signed last year with a major customer. This, along with solid trends in other African markets, are expected to drive an acceleration in regional organic tenant billings growth to above 9% in the second half of the year. 
Moving on to Europe. We now expect organic tenant billings growth of over 5% for the full year, up around 150 basis points versus our prior outlook. This is being driven primarily by 2 factors. First, we expect higher levels of gross new business in our legacy Europe business, where we're continuing to see strong 5G-driven activity, particularly in Germany. Organic tenant billings growth for our legacy European assets is now expected to come in at above 4%, up more than 50 basis points as compared to our prior expectations.
And second, the colocation and amendment growth that we expect to see in the second half of the year on the Telxius assets, which is included in our organic tenant billings growth metric, is driving another 100 basis points or so of upside. We view this expected activity as reinforcing our long-term expectations for compelling growth on the Telxius assets. 
Finally, in India, we continue to expect roughly flat organic tenant billings for the year. We are seeing encouraging levels of gross activity in the market but also continued elevated levels of churn. And while we remain optimistic that the market will return to solid growth over the long term, we're not expecting a significant inflection point in growth in 2021, which is consistent with our prior outlook.
Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 15%, including a $183 million contribution from the Telxius assets, roughly $26 million in positive translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook and about $20 million in higher net straight line. In addition, we now expect $25 million in incremental expected services gross margin as services activity in the U.S. continues to outstrip our expectations. 
For the year, we expect to book roughly $105 million in services operating profit from total services revenue of $220 million. These positive items are being partially offset by roughly $30 million in incremental bad debt assumed for the full year, the majority of which is in India. 
Overall collections trends in the market remain solid, but we are taking a slightly more conservative approach for the back half of the year within our projections. The remaining bad debt is focused in Mexico, where Altan has recently filed for the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Given its government backing and recent progress within the business, we remain optimistic on the prospects of collecting billings with Altan in full. But because we expect the collections to be slow, we have made the bad debt entries for now, consistent with our historical approach in similar instances. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our expectations for full year consolidated AFFO and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 14%, with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.50 per share. The flow-through of incremental cash adjusted EBITDA as well as around $20 million in FX tailwinds are being offset by approximately $15 million, $31 million and $25 million in incremental maintenance CapEx, cash taxes and net cash interest expense, respectively, primarily driven by the Telxius transaction. On a per share basis, we now expect growth of right around 12% for the year. 
Finally, AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 10% versus 2020. This takes into account the expected closing of our transactions with CDPQ and Allianz in mid-Q3 and the corresponding minority interest impacts. The growth rates for the attributable metric is about 2% lower than our projected consolidated AFFO per share growth, primarily due to the fact that the onetime cash interest expense item associated with our prior African joint venture in 2020 did not apply to the AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders. Notably, across both of these metrics, we are well positioned to meet our target of driving double-digit growth for 2021. 
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our updated capital deployment expectations for 2021, which now contemplates the Telxius transaction and reflect our consistent focus on driving strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share. First, we continue to expect to dedicate approximately $2.3 billion towards our dividend in 2021, implying a year-over-year growth rate of around 15%, subject to Board approval. 
With regards to CapEx, we are raising our overall projections by $125 million at the midpoint. This includes around $65 million in startup CapEx attributable to the Telxius sites as well as $65 million in additional deployment CapEx as part of our revised expectations of constructing 7,000 sites this year, up from our previous outlook of 6,500. 
We continue to drive highly attractive returns through our program. And including our revised 2021 expectations, we have added around 24,000 new sites since 2016. Notably, our average day 1 NOI yields on build so far this year have been 11%. We are also adding $15 million in maintenance CapEx as we are accelerating a few maintenance projects over the rest of the year. This is being partially offset by about $20 million in lower anticipated land CapEx. 
On the acquisition front, we have deployed just under $9 billion so far this year, primarily on the Telxius transaction, and expect to spend another $600 million in early August to purchase the remaining 4,000 Telxius rooftop sites located in Germany. Of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, over 80% is composed of discretionary CapEx in M&A. 
On the debt side of the equation, we ended the second quarter with net leverage of 5.7x and expect that metric to trend down into the mid-5x range after closing the CDPQ and Allianz stake sales. We remain firmly committed to our investment grade rating and continue to expect that solid long-term adjusted EBITDA growth will allow us to naturally delever to the upper end of our 3 to 5x range over a multiyear period. 
Over the next few quarters, we expect to be opportunistic in evaluating the potential benefits of terming out a portion of our floating rate debt into long-term fixed-rate instruments as we continually work to optimize our balance sheet. Looking back over the last decade, we have utilized this strategy to essentially reduce our weighted average cost of debt by half to 2.4% as of Q2. 
Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a few minutes to highlight several elements of our disciplined capital deployment strategy, honing in on 2 international regions where we have been quite active recently, Europe and Africa.
Since the end of 2019, our most transformational international investments have been in Africa, through our acquisition of Eaton Towers, and most recently in Europe through the Telxius deal. As the chart to the left shows, organic colocations and amendment contributions in both regions have been accelerating. More importantly, we expect gross colocation and amendment activity to remain at elevated levels over a multiyear period, positioning us well to drive strong growth and attractive returns across our recently acquired assets in both regions.
In addition to acquiring high-quality strategic site portfolios, we have also been ramping up our new build programs across both regions, as you can see in the middle chart on the slide. In fact, we've gone from constructing in average of less than 100 sites annually back in the early 2010 to a forecast of around 1,600 sites in 2021, primarily in Africa. Importantly, the return characteristics of these builds have remained extremely attractive, with average day 1 NOI yields of approximately 10% expected this year. 
As you can also see, yields have risen sharply on older vintages of new build sites as a result of the strong lease-up trends I just mentioned, and we expect to continue to drive meaningful colocation and amendment revenue on our new build sites in the future.
Further, we continue to focus on building and leasing sites to high-quality, large investment-grade tenants who we believe will drive the bulk of the network investments in these regions for the foreseeable future. We anticipate the demand for new builds across Africa and also in Europe, where we have inherited a robust pipeline with Telefónica as part of the Telxius acquisition, to remain strong as carriers address their coverage and capacity needs to meet 4G and 5G demand.
We are also focused on growing our business sustainably, while driving industry leadership and innovation. A perfect example of this is what we've been doing in Africa with energy efficiency and renewable energy, where, by the end of 2021, we will have invested upwards of $250 million on lithium-ion batteries, solar power solutions and other energy-efficient technology. 
While we are still fairly early in the overall progression of these investments, the initial results have been compelling, with average diesel consumption per site declining by around 35%, coupled with improved battery and generator efficiency and elevated uptime levels that we believe are best-in-class. Through these initiatives, not only are we earning an attractive return on investment, but we are also helping to build and enhance a sustainable global digital ecosystem.
This approach to capital deployment in Africa and Europe is indicative of our overall global investment philosophy. We continue to look for compelling opportunities to deploy capital in responsible, sustainable ways where we can generate attractive, long-term returns and solid growth while partnering with large multinational mobile network operators as they bring enhanced connectivity to their customers. And we believe that the global diversification that we've built into the business will benefit us for years to come.
Finally, on Slide 14 and in summary, Q2 was another quarter of solid organic growth, margin expansion, meaningful new build activity and consistent dividend growth. This was achieved while closing on and beginning to integrate the vast majority of our Telxius acquisition, issuing over $2 billion in euro-denominated debt at record low rates, completing a successful common equity issuance and partnering with 2 world-class strategic investors in CDPQ and Allianz.
For all of this, I'd like to offer a huge thank you to our nearly 6,000 global employees, including those who have recently joined us from Telxius. Their hard work, unwavering dedication and numerous talents have positioned us extremely well to continue driving compelling total returns for our stockholders. We look forward to finishing 2021 strong and are more excited than ever about our long-term growth trajectory based on the continuing global rise in mobile data demand and our durable competitive advantage throughout our served markets.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

I mean we do have a lot of experience with these types of transactions. But I'm really proud of the teams working through, obviously, a different -- difficult pandemic in terms of getting things done. But all early signs are really positive for us.
The people, the teams, the expertise, you've seen some of the other sides' even results in the quarter and the expectation for the year as a result of what we're seeing in both of those critical markets. I mean for us, from a European perspective, the TAM is large. We see new spectrum being deployed. So 5G growth is strong.
The organic growth that we see in -- particularly even in Germany, is stronger than we originally even had thought. And from a portfolio perspective, we had done a lot of due diligence, as I mentioned, and as Rod mentioned on the sites themselves. We know them quite well. And they're continuing to perform just like we thought.
So as I said in my remarks, in our view, this was the best portfolio there with a really solid, high-quality anchor tenant. So everything is going very, very well for us, and we're expecting a good strong year. And then obviously, strength going into '22, I think the organic billings growth is going to continue to uptick. And it will be stronger out of the back end of this year, leading us into providing great foundation for growth in '22. So really all very positive.
On the private network side, we continue to look at a number of different initiatives, utilizing different spectrum. And so I don't know how quickly they're going to be rolled out candidly, Simon, and we were participating. As I said, we have a sizable group looking at what the opportunity could be. We have significant DAS networks as you well know. And we're really looking at how can we migrate them to kind of the next technology. 
We'd like to be able to lower the overall cost in the venues that we're in. And so we're looking at available spectrum and looking at technology, but we're still really in the early stages of that deployment. We're in the CBRS Alliance as you well know, and taking advantage of that knowledge and seeing whether there are opportunities leveraging that technology, that spectrum, to be able to even increase the overall value proposition that we have for our customers."

It is broad-based. So we see activities through all the carriers.
The one thing that I would point out is with DISH, we will see revenue from their activity on our organic tenant billings really begin to impact the numbers in 2022, not so much in 2021, but they're certainly out active doing the planning for their network. They're active in our services business, which you saw the numbers this morning. We're increasing our services outlook to $220 million.

The availability of private capital kind of really changed the complexion of your footprint in Europe starting with PGGM, and then scaling up with the Telxius deal now with Allianz and CDPQ. Is that kind of money of that kind of scale available only in the developed markets? Or could that -- those relationships or new relationships pivot and kind of change the complexion of some of the work you're doing in the emerging markets next? 
And I guess the second question is, Tom, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that Brazil was doing well, improving even. I think that, that was kind of an unknown factor with respect to the Oi situation and the carriers kind of splitting up assets down there. Is that an American Tower specific thing? Or is just the entire wireless market irrespective of the Oi situation just doing better?"

I mean on the first one, we're obviously very opportunistic in terms of looking at various forms of capital. But I can tell you that the pension funds, infra funds, there is an extensive amount of capital that's available in all of the markets that we're servicing. So yes, it is there, and we'll take a look at whether it makes sense for us, whether they're the right partners for us. Our intent here on looking and diversifying the pools of capital that we're using is to provide a platform for us to be able to expand and expand aggressively if it makes sense to do so.
And so in Europe, we've set ourselves up with, I think, really solid partners in the marketplace, and it really provides a very efficient platform for us to be able to expand. Now the transactions need to be there and they need to make sense for us and all of those things. But having those kinds of partners and that kind of capital available really, I think, is a -- helps us significantly in terms of being able to expand in those areas quickly.
And with regards to Brazil, Brazil -- and I'll do a shout out to our teams in Brazil because we think that the splitting of the Oi portfolio is going to be a long-term positive for the marketplace. Candidly, there are better funded carriers that picked up those particular assets and it rationalized the portfolios down there quite a bit. And now the spectrum is in the hands of entities, our customers and the market that really want to deploy it and really want to advance the technology deployments in the marketplace.
So we think it's that particular transaction event in the marketplace was a net positive for us. And as I said, I remain really optimistic on the opportunities in the marketplace and the way our teams are really taking advantage of it."

Tim, again, on the private capital. we looked at the private capital is a very cost-effective way of aligning ourselves to very attractive partners with deep pools of cash to be able to position us and provide us with a platform for some sizable growth going forward. Now -- and that's not an indication that we've got the deals in the hopper that we're ready to roll on. But there are some significant portfolios in the marketplace that may make sense for us going forward. We'll look at each one individually and whether it does. But having that pool of capital makes sense from a diversification perspective.
I'm big on diversification. As you can see through our portfolio, we have a very broad sense of diversification between U.S. and international and within international, with developed and developing markets. And I think that rule proves true for forms of capital, that we want to ensure that we've got access into all different forms of capital that's available to us and take advantage of that going forward. So that's really it, I think, on the capital side.
On the active versus passive, we've been very successful on the passive side of this. And our intent is to try to continue to stay in that type of a role and leverage that kind of a model. There are certain elements on the active side that we are involved with. Power, for example. We have a number of initiatives in many of our -- actually all of our markets from a power perspective, some on the primary power side, where we're the primary supplier of power in markets like Africa and India.
And so from that standpoint, we are part of the kind of the active management of ensuring that their networks are running properly. And we've done -- as Rod pointed out, we've done some significant investment in areas, whether it's in solar or lithium to be able to improve our capabilities and to be able to offer that value to our customers as well as generate value for ourselves as well as generate value for -- from an eco perspective in those markets and really provide kind of a sustainable platform going forward.
We're also very involved in the secondary power side. You look at the United States, for example, in your developed markets, we have thousands of generators in those markets and providing secondary power and backup for our customers there. And we're even looking from a power perspective as kind of a virtual power source from a storage perspective that we might be able to provide, particularly in our international markets, as we continue to really leverage solar as well as lithium-ion.
We are even exploring with wind. We have sites there that have solar panels where we've deployed 50,000 to 60,000 panels in the region, and we've got wind turbine. So we're trialing a lot of different things, and we're working with a number of different external parties to really be able to leverage their expertise.
But when you start to get up into the real active side of the network, as I said, we have really tried to stay away from that, and we'll continue to do so. Our customers are looking for more involvement in that area. But that hasn't been our strength going there. And -- but I mean, to the extent that there are opportunities, and they make sense for us and we get the right resources and talent to be able to do so, we'll look at it. But that's not part of our major strategy right now."

Certainly, so in the U.S., we are projecting organic tenant billings growth right in that 3% range. It's been consistent, so we did not change that in the outlook.
And I'll just highlight a couple of things. The first one is we are seeing an acceleration in activity in colocation and amendment in the U.S. that we're very excited about, but that acceleration was contemplated when we executed the MLAs that we have in place. So a lot of that activity is kind of built-in pricing and within our guidance. So we think certainly for this year, it's very stable. We also gave longer-term guidance for the U.S., which you can go back and refer to.
A lot in that guidance, you can see that the growth rates in the U.S. are accelerating over the next several years, if you [indiscernible] a lot of things for the Sprint churn. But the other point that I would make is we do have the Sprint churn that will begin to roll off in Q4 of this year. The largest effect -- single year effect that we'll see from that will be in 2022. It will continue out to 2024. So there'll be 4 years of kind of Sprint churn. And again, the biggest impact will be in 2022.
But you'll see it in our numbers in the end of this year, but that's all baked in within our 3% organic tenant billings outlook. So we couldn't be more excited about the U.S. and its trajectory going forward. And once we get through the Sprint churn, we are expecting kind of an acceleration. And again, I would ask you to go back and refer to our longer-term guidance, and you'll see what I'm referring to in terms of the [ outlook ] and the acceleration in overall organic growth that we are expecting over the long term."

But structurally, they're similar and nothing that would drive any impact that would be noticed in terms of the numbers in those sorts of issues.
In terms of in Mexico, Altan has filed bankruptcy. So we're kind of working through that. I'll point out a couple of things. Here, number one is they do have a remaining term on their leases that's quite long. So we have about 6 years remaining on all their leases. They might make up about 9% of Mexico revenue. And so that's kind of the size that they are in terms of the business there. And it's less than 1%, close to 0.5% of the overall company revenue.
With all that said, just because they filed for bankruptcy doesn't mean that they're going to exit the market. So we'll be working through that with them and hope that they will restructure and stay in play. I think they're an important player in the Mexico market. They're supported by the government, and they have had a fair amount of success other than the fact that their overall balance sheet needs some support. 
So we still expect them to continue, but that will be kind of up to them as we move forward. And if for any reason, they did exit, we have that 6-year protection. And then we -- that service still needs to be provided. So they -- those customers would have to move on to another network, and that could potentially drive higher CapEx from that perspective to support that customer base on a different network."

Let me highlight here. In terms of our longer-term guidance, I don't want to get into the specifics around DISH and any specific contract terms, but they were in our longer-term guidance. So what we laid out was organic tenant billings growth of at least 4% on average over the next 7 years. That encompasses 2021 out through 2027. If you normalize that for the Sprint churn, it goes up to about 5%. 
There are 2 important chunks there in terms of time periods. If you isolate the 2021 and 2022 time period, we're looking at an average organic growth rate of about 2% in the U.S., including the Sprint churn that we've all discussed. Normalizing for that, it would be up around 5%. If you take that next step out to 2023, to 2027, we're projecting greater than 5% even with the residual churn from Sprint. And normalize for that, we're projecting greater than 6% growth between 2023 and 2027. 
So DISH is in there. We're building sites for them today. Revenue will start for them in 2022 and ramp over the next few years. They're in that longer-term guidance, and you can see that longer-term guidance is higher in the out years than it is in the early years because we do expect to see acceleration in a build there as the carriers build out 5G kind of across the U.S. and deploy the new spectrum."

Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets and the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future. 
At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations. In the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue to drive, our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we are excited about and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term. 
Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future as macro towers should remain the most cost and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide. Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless CapEx spending in markets like the United States and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally. 
We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the 2.5 gig band currently being deployed in the U.S., as the workhorse of the true 5G experience and we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. 
Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of the sub-6 gig frequencies compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multiyear period of strong growth on our tower sites. 
We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S. today, generating record services revenues driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless CapEx spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next 5 years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last 5 years and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade. This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term noncancelable leases that comprise our more than $60 billion global contractual backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027 and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that same period. 
I'll touch on this further in a few minutes. But as a quick reminder, these baseline growth expectations exclude any material contributions from our various platform expansion initiatives. What they do include are expectations for an extended period of solid growth in our European markets, where we are seeing similar network growth trends to the United States with early-stage 5G deployments set to accelerate in the coming years. We expect that our newly scaled European presence will allow us to drive long-term value creation as the explosion of mobile data usage across the region continues and the need for communications infrastructure accelerates as a result. 
Across Germany, Spain and France, where 5G mobile subscriptions currently make up less than 5% of the total user base, we expect mobile data usage per smartphone to grow by more than 25% annually for the next 5 years, similar to the United States, and consequently expect CapEx spend across the 3 markets to exceed $11 billion annually over a similar time period. 
And as happened in the United States, we are already seeing this acceleration in network investment translate into elevated activity. In fact, in the third quarter, normalizing for the impacts of the Telxius deal co-location and amendment contributions to European organic tenant billings growth rose by around 200 basis points year-over-year. Although we expect a significant portion of initial 5G investments to be focused in urban locations across our European footprint where roughly 80% of the population resides, we anticipate urban-oriented consumer demand to be complemented by an ongoing push from European regulators to deliver rural connectivity, which will represent another opportunity for us to drive colocation on our tower sites in those areas. We believe our balance of rural and recently expanded urban assets positions us well to capture significant market share of upcoming 5G deployments over the next decade. 
Finally, in our earlier stage markets across Latin America, Asia and Africa, we continue to see solid demand for our critical infrastructure largely driven by deployments of legacy network technologies, particularly 4G. Whether looking at Brazil, Mexico, India or Nigeria, consumers are rapidly increasing their utilization of smartphones, thereby driving mobile data usage growth higher. In many of these regions, existing network infrastructure is insufficient to support this deluge of usage as sell-side performance is challenged with increased levels of network load. In response to these trends, we are aggressively marketing our existing assets and continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities to bolster our footprint in these markets. 
But at the same time, we have significantly ramped up our new build program given the tremendous need for entirely new infrastructure. In fact, if you take the nearly 5,900 sites we built last year and add our expected 7,000 sites at the midpoint of our outlook to be constructed this year, it would represent almost as many sites as the previous 5 years combined. And as we laid out a few quarters ago, we are targeting the construction of up to 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years. With day 1 NOI yields on these builds continuing to average above 10%, we are excited about deploying significant capital to these initiatives going forward as we capitalize on the advancement of network technology across the emerging world while helping to connect billions of people. 
In addition to the core secular growth trends driving our global tower business, we are seeing indications, particularly in more mature markets like the United States, of a broad evolution within the overall wireless ecosystem. This evolution is closely intertwined with 5G and includes an increased prevalence of cloud-native network solutions, more emphasis on the various permutations of the network edge and an ever-increasing intersection of the wired and wireless portions of today's converged network architecture. 
As networks virtualize, O-RAN or Open RAN, it's expected to become a more important option to improve their economics. We are now starting to see this phenomenon with DISH in the United States, and in Germany, where 1&1 has spoken extensively about its intent to utilize this technology. By utilizing O-RAN, carriers have the potential to optimize network design and drive cost efficiencies, freeing up incremental capital to invest in densification and other network enhancements that help drive growth in site deployments and colocations. 
Importantly, the role of the tower in this evolving network design is as critical as ever. While base station functionality will likely continue to evolve to be cloud native software agile, the radio equipment that is placed on the tower itself, which has always driven our revenue, will continue to reside on the tower. Importantly, we believe we can leverage our extensive global distributed real estate portfolio to not only drive continued strong growth in our core tower business but also to take advantage of other emerging opportunities as networks virtualize. This may include multi-access edge computing and potential other edge cloud permutations of neutral host infrastructure. At the end of the day, modern software-driven networks are becoming smarter, faster, more capable and more dynamic, and we are focused on ensuring that American Tower has a meaningful role to play in this context on the infrastructure and real estate side of the equation. 
One of the areas we focused on is the development of the network edge or, more accurately, the development of multiple layers of the network edge. With the need for lower latency expected to become more and more critical over time with applications like AR, VR, telemedicine, real-time analytics, autonomous driving, entertainment, streaming, you name it, and many others are beginning to emerge, we continue to believe that this could be a meaningful opportunity for American Tower. As we've done more work on the evolution of the edge, the concept of multiple edge layers has come into better focus. 
Today, for example, by far the most prevalent layer is the regional metro edge owned, for the most part, by the large data center companies where vast amounts of data processing is then centralized. These locations provide access to cloud on-ramps and are absolutely critical within today's networks. We expect this need to be the case for the foreseeable future. In fact, as the volume of data carried across networks continues to explode, we anticipate the demand for these types of large-scale facilities will only grow. The upside of these locations is their size and capacity. The downside, to this point, hasn't been all that relevant, is the fairly significant network transit costs and latency built into reaching these central compute functions as the data often has to travel hundreds of miles to reach these destinations. These transit costs and latency considerations, which we expect to become more important in the future, will necessitate more edge locations as uplink data increases from IoT use cases and demands for distributed computing advance. 
The next layer beyond the metro edge, in our view, will be the aggregation edge. Here, you're likely to post C-RAN hubs and future MEC applications as network virtualization advances, along with distributed data processing, AI inferencing and other compute functions which will need reduced latency. The major hyperscalers continue to evolve their edge cloud platforms so that they can extend computing capabilities deeper into the mobile access network at the aggregation edge. 
The next layer beyond this, which we turn the access edge is where our existing tower sites are located today, offering an opportunity to meaningfully enhance the value of our legacy real estate. We expect to eventually see vRAN and O-RAN network functions, AI inferencing, data caching and a variety of other next-generation AR and VR cloud-native ultra-low-latency applications residing at these locations. 
Finally, we've also identified the on-premise edge, which would lie beyond even our tower sites and could eventually help support private networks, smart factories and a host of other applications located at the end-user site. At the end of the day, our 20,000-foot view is that all of these edge elements will need to fit together to provide a cohesive framework for full-scale 5G across the network ecosystem. The goal for us is to figure out what the optimal linkages between the layers look like, who are the key players will be and what elements of the edge we may want to own in order to further enhance the strong long-term growth we expect from our core existing business. 
To date, as we seek to connect the dots, we've been active with a number of trial edge compute sites at the access edge while also operating our Colo ATL metro data center interconnection facility in Atlanta. Through these investments, we have built relationships with key existing and potential future customers, have learned a tremendous amount about key demand trends and have had a front row seat for the beginning stages of the convergence of wireless and wireline networks that I alluded to earlier. 
More recently, we acquired DataSite a data center company, consisting of 2 multi-tenant data centers in the Atlanta area and in Orlando. In addition to strengthening our existing position in Atlanta, the addition of a network dense carrier hotel facility in Orlando provides us with a strong Southeastern presence with the profile and characteristics that we believe will be critical in the early evolution of the metro edge as we evaluate its role in the mobile networks of the future. We expect these facilities, which have 18 megawatts of combined power, an additional 4.5 megawatts of expansion capacity, to effectively complement Colo ATL and enable us to enhance our ability to develop neutral-host, multi-operator, multi-cloud data centers to support the broader core to edge connectivity evolution in the United States. We continue to believe that while a scaled application-driven edge-oriented business model is still likely several years away, it has the potential to be a sizable market opportunity with meaningful potential upside not only in the United States but also on a global basis. 
Leading global MNOs are now positioning their networks with released 16 5G stand-alone core features to explore edge cloud opportunities. And with our distributed macro side presence markets around the world, we think we are well positioned to potentially be a provider of choice on the edge, particularly for large multinational MNOs and other categories of customers who may be looking for a multi-market solution. 
Switching gears a bit. While we believe edge compute will eventually also be relevant in emerging markets, it is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Consequently, we have focused our platform expansion efforts across our developing regions and other areas, most notably on increasing the sustainability and efficiency of power provisioning in our sites. As we highlighted in our recently published 2020 corporate sustainability report, we've continued to make progress toward our goal of reducing diesel-related greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2027 from a 2017 baseline. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019, reaching 53% of the 10-year goal. We are continuing to make solid progress in 2021 with an expectation to spend an additional $80 million towards energy-efficient solutions primarily in lithium ion and solar power across our Africa footprint, which will bring our cumulative spend to nearly $250 million. And as we announced earlier this week, we are furthering our commitment to combat climate change by adopting science-based targets, which we expect to help inform our future investments in sustainability. 
In addition to the positive environmental benefits from these investments, we are also delivering shareholder value through AFFO per share accretion. Lithium ion batteries provide significant energy efficiency, density and lifespan improvements over legacy solutions. And while, to date, AFFO benefits to American Tower have largely come through fuel savings we anticipate over time that our yields on these investments will further expand as we are able to lengthen battery and generator replacement cycles. Having already expanded our lithium ion-powered site count from 4,500 in 2019 to 6,700 in 2020, we are targeting another 8,000 sites by the end of 2022 and recently signed a multimillion dollar bulk battery purchase agreement in Africa in support of this goal. 
Importantly, we believe that energy efficiency, the use of renewables and sustainability in our broader sense can represent an important competitive advantage for us not only from the flow-through to AFFO but also the differentiation in service quality for our customers. We continue to view sustainability as a critical component of our company culture, and we'll be highlighting our continued progress in future sustainability reports, which I encourage all of you to read by the way. 
In closing, our excitement around 5G on a global basis continues to grow. Consumers and enterprises are using more advanced devices for more things, resulting in consistent elevated growth in mobile data usage, which, in turn, strains existing wireless networks and necessitates incremental densification and network improvement. Considerable new spectrum is being deployed. New entrants in select markets are building greenfield networks, and our macro tower-oriented portfolio remains well positioned to capture a significant portion of wireless investment activity. In addition, through our platform expansion strategy, we are focused on ensuring that the company benefits from the ongoing convergence of wireless and wireline and the associated expansion of virtualization in cloud-native applications throughout the network ecosystem. 
Importantly, as we optimize our core business and look for ways to further enhance our growth path in the broader digital infrastructure world, we are as committed as ever to driving profitability, sustainability and recurring growth. We're energized by the future and are excited to be in a vibrant industry that is helping to connect the world. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2021 outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us.

I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us. And as you heard from Tom, we are as encouraged as ever by the technological trends that underpin our long-term growth potential. 
Before digging into the details of our results and raised outlook, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we closed on our strategic partnership agreements with CDPQ and Allianz through which they purchased an aggregate of 48% of our ATC Europe business for a total consideration of around EUR 2.6 billion. In addition, we closed the remaining 4,000 Telxius communication sites in Germany back in August. With the transaction now fully closed and funded, our teams are working to rapidly integrate the assets, and we are already seeing encouraging activity on the portfolio. 
Second, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes, including our euro offering earlier this month. Through our financing transactions, we have been able to maintain an attractive weighted average cost of debt while also continuing to extend our maturities. As a result of this activity, along with the benefit from a nonrecurring advance payment received from a tenant during the quarter, we finished Q3 with net leverage of 4.9x. While we expect net leverage to increase back into the low 5x range in the fourth quarter, we are right on track with our overall post-Telxius delevering path. 
And lastly, we saw another quarter of record services activity in the U.S. as carriers accelerated 5G-related projects. We view this as a leading indicator of strong levels of gross leasing in our property segment as we head into 2022 and beyond. And with that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth. 
As you can see, our consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year-over-year or over 18% on an FX-neutral basis to nearly $2.4 billion. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of around 10% and international property revenue growth of over 31% or 13% when excluding the impacts of the Telxius acquisition. This strong performance is indicative of a continuation of the long-term secular trends driving demand for our infrastructure assets across the globe. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we also had a solid quarter of organic tenant billings growth throughout the business. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% for a second consecutive quarter. As expected, U.S. 5G investments from the major carriers drove healthy activity levels, leading to organic tenant billings growth in our U.S. and Canada segment of over 4%. Contributions from colocation and amendments were more than 3%. Escalators came in at 3.2% and churn was just over 2%. 
Moving to our international operations. We drove organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6%, reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 60 basis points. Africa was our fastest growing region in the quarter, posting organic tenant billings growth of well over 9% led by Nigeria, where we continue to see 4G investments driving both colocation activity and new site construction. We also saw a consistent quarter in Latin America, where organic tenant billings growth was right around 7% driven by solid new business and higher escalators primarily in Brazil. 
Meanwhile, European organic tenant billings growth accelerated by around 100 basis points sequentially and to nearly 5.5% as expected. Excluding impacts from the Telxius acquisition, organic tenant billings growth in the region would have been over 4.5% in the quarter, more than 200 basis points higher than the year ago period driven primarily by new business contributions. This positive trend reflects both ongoing 4G activity and early 5G investments leading to solid growth from both colocations and amendments. 
Looking to Germany, in particular, we saw a more than 300 basis point increase in colocation and amendment contributions in our legacy business as compared to the prior year period, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of over 5.5%, up from 5.2% in the second quarter. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we saw organic tenant billings growth of 0.7% and up roughly 200 basis points as compared to Q2. This reflects a modest acceleration in gross new business activity, coupled with a more than 2% sequential decline in churn, which was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew more than 19% or over 18% on an FX-neutral basis to nearly $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.2%, which was down compared to Q3 2020 as a result of adding new lower initial tenancy assets to our portfolio, which we believe will drive strong organic growth and, therefore, margin expansion in the future. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.3%, a roughly 40 basis point sequential improvement. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was over 13% with consolidated AFFO per share of $2.53, reflecting a per share growth of nearly 11%. This was driven by strong performance in our core business, contributions from new assets and around $13 million in year-over-year FX favorability. Our performance also reflected the benefits of our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our operations and minimizing financing costs despite growing the portfolio by nearly 38,000 sites over the last year. And finally, AFFO per share attributable to AMT common stockholders was $2.49, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 12%. 
Let's now turn to our updated outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, our expectations for organic growth across the business are consistent with our prior outlook. Carriers continue to deploy meaningful capital as they invest in network quality, and we are seeing numerous bands of spectrum being deployed for both 4G and 5G. We are also slightly increasing our expectations for services revenue for the year to around $235 million as a result of an outsized third quarter, although this implies that services volumes will moderate somewhat in Q4. 
Second, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency and cost controls, along with some onetime benefits, we expect to be able to take some costs out of the business as compared to our prior expectations. Combined with the current services gross margin outperformance, this will drive our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations higher for the balance of the year. 
Third, in India, we are encouraged by recent regulatory reforms, which we believe can provide some much-needed breathing room for capital-constrained carriers in the marketplace and improve the telecom environment overall. While we believe this is a clear positive first step towards market recovery, we continue to expect flat 2021 organic tenant billings growth in the region as we further evaluate the long-term impacts of these developments on the sector. Finally, incorporating the latest FX projections, our current outlook reflects negative FX impacts of $30 million for property revenue, $20 million for adjusted EBITDA and $15 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. 
With that, let's move to the details of our revised full year outlook. Looking at Slide 8, as expected, leasing trends remained strong across our global business, and as a result of an increase in pass-through together with some modest core property revenue outperformance, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $10 million. This represents 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and includes $30 million in unfavorable translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. 
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. This includes roughly 3% growth in our U.S. and Canada segment where 5G deployments are driving solid activity levels as we exit the year. As a reminder, we expect the first and largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn to hit our run rate in the fourth quarter of this year. And while we expect gross activity to remain solid, our guide implies a Q4 U.S. organic tenant billings growth rate of negative 1%, as we communicated previously. On the international side, we continue to anticipate organic tenant billings growth in the range of 5% to 6% as carriers continue to focus their efforts on enhancing and densifying wireless networks in the face of ever-rising mobile data demand. 
Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $50 million and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 16%. This increase reflects continued strength in our services segment, where we now expect to see roughly $145 million in services gross margin for the year, up from the $123 million implied in our prior guidance with year-over-year growth of more than 180%. On the cost side of the equation, we continue to maintain cost discipline globally, helping to drive adjusted EBITDA margins up by around 40 basis points for the full year as compared to prior expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO expectations and now expect year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of roughly 15% with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.64 per share. The flow-through of incremental cash-adjusted EBITDA, coupled with the continued cash tax and net cash interest benefits as compared to the prior expectations are being partially offset by around $15 million in negative translational FX impacts. On a per share basis, we now expect growth of approximately 14% for the year consistent with our long-term growth ambitions that we highlighted at the start of the year. Finally, AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 12% versus 2020, incorporating the minority interest impacts of our strategic partnership with CDPQ and Allianz in Europe. 
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021. As you can see, we remain focused on deploying capital towards assets that drive strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share coupled with a growing dividend, providing our investors with a compelling combination of growth plus yield. 
Working our way through the specific categories, our first priority remains our dividend. For the full year, we continue to expect to distribute $2.3 billion, subject to Board approval, which implies a roughly 15% year-over-year per share growth rate. As a reminder, our dividend growth will continue to be driven by underlying growth in our REIT taxable income, incorporating the impacts of M&A and other moving pieces in the business. Consistent with our prior comments, we anticipate growing our dividend by at least 10% annually in the coming years. 
Moving on to CapEx. We reiterate our expectations of spending nearly $1.6 billion at the midpoint with nearly 90% being discretionary in nature. Driving a good portion of this discretionary CapEx is our continued expectation to construct 7,000 sites at the midpoint this year with the vast majority in our international markets. 
Turning to acquisitions. Including contributions from minority partners, we have deployed around $10 billion so far this year primarily for the Telxius transaction. as well as for smaller transactions, including DataSite. In total, of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployment for the year, we expect over 80% to be composed of discretionary growth CapEx and M&A. 
Moving to the center of the slide. You can see the composition of our $35 billion in cumulative capital deployments since the start of 2017, including our 2021 full year expectations. We continue to augment our developed market presence, which we believe positions us optimally to drive value from accelerating 5G deployments and next-generation technology evolutions, as Tom laid out earlier. 
We are also allocating capital towards higher growth earlier-stage markets that are typically at least 5 years behind the U.S. and Europe in their network deployments. Taken together, we believe that our global footprint positions us to capture multiple waves of investments across the globe over a sustained period of time. 
Finally, -- You can see that more than 1/4 or around $9.5 billion of our deployed capital in the last 5 years has been distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to view these components as critical to total shareholder returns. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Supporting this phase of significant investment and growth has been our investment-grade balance sheet. We believe that our access to low-cost, diversified sources of financing has been a key differentiator and are proactively working to extend this critical competitive advantage into the future. In fact, incorporating our latest financing efforts, we now have a weighted average cost of debt of around 2.4%, a weighted average tenor of debt of approximately 7 years and over 85% of our balance sheet locked into fixed rate instruments. 
Finally, on Slide 13, and in summary, in Q3, we continue to capitalize on a strong global demand backdrop, delivering our highest quarter of consolidated AFFO per share on record. This was driven by solid organic growth, record-setting services volumes, disciplined cost controls, strategic balance sheet management and accretive portfolio expansion. As we look ahead, we believe our existing global real estate portfolio is well positioned to drive long-term recurring growth as carriers augment and extend their networks. And with the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and diversified pool of funding sources, we expect to continue to deploy capital towards accretive investments that can enhance our growth path and enable us to create additional value. 
Given our positioning at the intersection of real estate and technology in an ever more interconnected world, we are excited to continue to deliver connectivity to billions of people worldwide in a sustainable way while driving compelling total returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

So in terms of the U.S. leasing environment, we're seeing a very strong environment. Certainly, all the major carriers have been active. You've seen that show up most notably in our services environment. We've seen a tick-up in the contribution from colocation and amendment activity into our organic tenant billings growth. So that's been accelerating through each of the last 3 quarters, just as we expected from the outset in the year. So in terms of our expectations, everything really is right in line with what we expected. 
I don't want to get too deep into the second part of your question around growth and activity when it comes to 2022. But I will just reiterate a couple of points that we've already made. So directionally, your comments are correct. We guided to an average organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. for '21 and '22 of around 2%. You can see we're coming in here in '21 at around 3%. That suggests around 1% organic tenant billings growth for 2022 in the U.S. So that's where we would expect to be. And again, I'm not providing guidance for next year, just reiterating the components of our long-term plan. 
And maybe one thing that I will kind of highlight here just briefly is that Sprint churn hit us in Q4 for the first time, that first tranche, as you heard in my comments. So Sprint churn, now that it's active, I'll just give you the numbers there, again. 2021, we are rolling off $195 million of annual Sprint revenue and churn. In 2022, we'll roll off an additional 60. 2023, we'll roll off another $50 million. And 2024, we'll roll off another $70 million. So that's Sprint churn here. That's what's really causing the lower organic growth rates in our U.S. business next year. The gross growth, we see the environment being very strong, accelerating through 2021, and we expect that to continue going in. 
Just to give you a couple of the piece parts. In terms of the impact it will have in the fourth quarter, you will see organic kind of billings growth rates in the U.S. at around a negative 1%. That will include churn for the quarter of about 6.6%, and embedded within that is about 4.5% just from the Sprint churn. And of course, all this will have an impact on AFFO in terms of going forward into future years. So we've guided that our goal is to hit double-digit FFO growth on average from 2021 out through 2027. And of course, some years, it will be higher. Some years, it will be lower. The goal really is an average. 
And when you think about 2022 when this first tranche of Sprint churn kind of rolling through, that's a year that I would say that it would be challenging to get to 10%. And I'll also say, Michael, we haven't given up on it. There are certain levers that we can pull and things that we can do with the business to maximize AFFO and AFFO per share growth, and we're doing all of those things. So that kind of puts a little bit of context around the U.S. activity for this year and rolling into next year."

I mean the impetus right now is really 5G and driving all of these lower latency types of applications and needs out further into the market closer and closer to the end user. We've always said, from a digital transformation perspective, it's going to be cloud-based, it's going to be connected and it's going to be distributed. And we think we're in a very good competitive position given the vast amount of distribution that we have in the 25 markets that we're servicing. So we're trying to position ourselves in this broader market to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. 
We're going to do it intelligently. Our execution strategy continues to evolve. We think we've done it intelligently in terms of picking up some of the metro sites, building out our own sites. We have some market agreements in place to drive access into those sites, and this is going to evolve. This is not going to happen overnight, as you well know. And so we've got partnerships in place to be able to look at this. We're going to be able to hopefully leverage some of those partnerships, and we'll just continue to monitor the best approach in terms of being able to best position ourselves to be able to take advantage of this opportunity. We've done that in the past in terms of being smart in terms of how we allocate capital to these types of investments. Will it take the form of partnerships owning -- further owning more metro sites, unclear at this point in time. That will continue to evolve as the market continues to evolve. But we do think we're in a really good position in terms of being able to leverage our real estate, our exclusive real estate and to be able to take advantage of that neutral host model."

So with the advanced prepayment, I'm not going to provide details around that. I will say it was a little over $1 billion from one of our customers. It really is just a prepayment for lease payments going out over, let's say, the next 12 months. So it will kind of run through our financial statements pretty quickly. And there's nothing more to it than just a prepayment of the next 12 months kind of leasing fees. So from our perspective, it's not a big deal. It helps with liquidity. It brought our leverage down a little bit. You saw we ended a little bit below 5x in terms of leverage. So it wasn't a bad thing for us to do, but it's a pretty simple transaction. And I wouldn't want you to read any more into it than that. 
In terms of supply chain, Tom, maybe you want to add a few comments here, but from a supply chain, we see no major impacts at this point, certainly across our business. As you can see in our services business, we continue to hit higher and higher levels of activity in bringing our outlook up again to the -- another consecutive quarter here. So we've got access to the crews. You've also seen our margins expanding in the services business in particular. And in the U.S., we're not building a tremendous amount of tower. So we certainly don't have any restrictions or challenges from that perspective. 
One place I would say, going into 2022, we will be keeping our eye on crew availability and labor and things like that. If the environment stays the way it is, we should be fine. If things get worse, we'll need to keep our eye on it. We do buy a lot of generators. We have generator orders out that are already in place that bring us out into the beginning to the middle of 2022. So from that perspective, we know we're going to get the materials we need, and we expect to get the materials we need and feel pretty good about that. 
But in the second half of 2022, again, we'll continue to watch the supply chain issues. And to the extent that there are any issues that get worse, we'll continue to keep an eye on it and kind of put the levers. But from where we sit now, we don't think we don't see anything hitting us right now. We don't expect any challenges through the middle of 2022. And beyond that, it's too early to comment. We'll just keep our eye on it."

So we posted a 0.7% positive growth rates we're still looking for the full year to be right around 0. And as we look at the market, we remain optimistic in terms of the gross activity. 
So the way that even that 0.7 organic tenant billings for the quarter, I'll give you a little bit of the breakdown there. So we're seeing high single digits, nearly double-digit organic new business. That's been pretty consistent for at least 6 to 8 consecutive quarters. And based on where they are in their development kind of transitioning from 3G to 4G networks, we expect that, that gross demand should continue. The escalators are locked in right around 2% to 2.2% or so, so we have that account. And we have seen a moderation in a pretty sharp decline here year-over-year in terms of the churn rate. So a year ago, Q3 churn in India was about 13.5%. It's down out of about 7.5%. We think that's certainly a very favorable sign and one that we expected to see, and we hope to continue to see that going forward. 
In terms of the -- you did see that there was some good news from the government in terms of regulatory support for the industry. And we think that, that will help the market in general, the whole sector as well as the carriers, particularly the ones with the AGR dues, but all the carriers even with your spectrum fees, strengthen their own balance sheets, kind of regroup and gear up for competition in the sector there and to invest in the networks. So we are optimistic about going forward growth rates there, but we would expect, let's call it, high single-digit organic growth with churn levels there in the mid-single digits and hopefully moderating down over time."

You've seen a couple of sequential quarters of increased organic growth rates, just as we expected to see now that the market has kind of seen a reduction in churn, they're gearing up for 5G deployment. So that's been really good to see. 
In terms of the piece parts of the organic tenant billings, certainly, the Telefónica additional sites plays a role in there. One of the biggest ways that it plays in early on, it's still very early in terms of bringing those assets in. But I think we've talked before about the assets there in Europe that they basically have a long-term contract, and there are other tenant -- material other tenants on there. So there's really very little churn that will -- that's possible on that portfolio. So we have very low churn expectations on that portfolio, and it's a big chunk of revenue. That certainly helps kind of inflect the growth rates to go up higher.

With regards to Europe, we think we have a really solid position in a few of the critical markets. We've got good scale in the market.

But we continue to look at opportunities to further build scale not just in the 3 markets that we're in but also if there are other opportunities, but only if it makes sense, like everything else that we do. 
And so there are, I think, a lot of opportunities in the region, and we're evaluating them as you would expect. And to the extent that there's some opportunities there to secure some of that portfolio to gain further scale even in the markets that we're in and relationships with key customers, we'll clearly look to do that. And so Europe is, as we've said, an area or part of the world that we look to continue to further develop if it makes sense. 
With regards to Telefónica, again, we've got a great global relationship with them. They're positioning to an MVNO, as you all know, and they're going to have some time for that to be able to -- for that to occur. There will be some churn over time, but the contract that we have with them I think goes out for several years at this point in time. And so we'll continue to monitor that.

Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So let's hit interest rates first. So you've seen us, Rick, over the last several quarters, even the last couple of years, very active in the capital markets, very active in terms of our debt structure, capital structure and different things like that. So we've been focused on strengthening our balance sheet in a very proactive way. So we now have our average maturities out over about 7 years with an average cost of debt down to about 2.4% or so. And 85% of our debt is now fixed out over the long term. So that's a heavier weighting to expect to variable compared to our kind of standard financial policy. So we've been preparing for an environment where interest rates may tick up. So we think from an interest rate perspective, our balance sheet is very solid and ready for it. There's nothing we can do about preventing interest rates from rising. We do think they may rise over time modestly, but we're very well prepared for it. 
The other thing I would add is in terms of global capital allocation and looking to invest capital, the strength of our balance sheet really does represent a competitive advantage for us, particularly in a time when interest rates may be rising. So we'll keep an eye on that and look to be very opportunistic as we go forward from that perspective. 
And then when you think about inflation rates, one of the ways you'll see that run through our business as many of our contracts internationally, particularly in  Africa and Latin America, are all geared towards inflation rates and the escalator is adjusted based on inflation rate. So as and when we see higher levels of inflation in the international markets, we'll see higher levels of growth as well. 
In the U.S., I'd remind you that our escalators are fixed at around 3%. That's been consistent for a long time. So we're pretty well insulated from interest rates rising in the U.S. from a balance sheet perspective, but we still lock in that revenue growth of 3% on the U.S. escalator."

And so there's still a lot of opportunity in the markets that we're in, given how carriers, our existing customers' carriers are looking at -- continually looking at trying to monetize their portfolio. Smaller towercos are looking for opportunities to exit. There is private capital involved in some of those smaller towercos, and so they're looking to monetize some of their funds, some increased opportunity in Southeast Asia that's going on as we speak, as you've well seen.

So for the full year, we're looking -- you can see in our presentation in terms of AFFO attributable to our minority shareholders is about $100 million. That breaks down $75 million roughly for the European business and about $25 million for the India business. 
The way our partners kind of break down is you know CDPQ owns 30% of our European business and Allianz owns about 18% of that business. PGGM holds about 17% in Germany and about 13% in Spain. And we have Macquarie as a partner over in India. They own about 8%. Now is a good time to kind of think about the run rate aspect of that minority interest. When you look at Q4, now that all the dust has settled, we think the run rate -- a good ballpark run rate is about $40 million for Q4. So if you annualize that, you get a range of 1 50 to 1 60 that would be attributable to the minority interest partners. 
The one word question I would say is we will -- we did receive the put for Macquarie. You've seen that in our filings. So we will eventually close on that, and that will be an adjustment to the numbers at that time."

We've got a pretty robust build program there. So you've seen the guide with 7,000 sites that we expect to build as a good chunk of those in Africa, and in Africa, a lot of them are in Nigeria. So I would say that we are very bullish on Nigeria in terms of the growth rates. We're seeing high single-digit, if not double-digit, organic growth rates in Nigeria. As long as the economy there continues to roll forward, I think we're in a really good shape, and that's largely, I believe, based on fuel pricing."

We'll be aggressive from a capital perspective to the extent that there are some sites that we need to attend to, to -- from a structural perspective to be able to support them. 
But as I've said all along, I mean, this was a really terrifically built portfolio, and that was one of the attractions to the portfolio to begin with. So we're being as aggressive as we can to really be able to take advantage of these sites, particularly in markets like Germany and Spain, where 5G is really picking up. 
From a U.S. perspective, you're right. I mean if you go back to even the old analog days, I mean the markets were generally built up from your urban markets because that's where you're able to get the best bang for the buck when you're rolling out capital. This one, though, I would say with 5G is broader. I mean it is a goal to get nationwide coverage for all the customers and then to continue to fill it in as demand and as capacity requirements are required. 
What's not a surprise to us, and then I reiterated in my comments, the macro towers is the main asset that our customers are deploying 5G on. And I never had any doubts of that simply -- I mean, I've been involved in the industry for 30 years. So the macro tower is just the best way for our customers to get that signal out to their customers, and so we're seeing that. But we are seeing it more across the entire country, again, as customers are really trying to be able to get to that nationwide coverage."

So Tim, I would say that it really works in a variety of ways depending on which contracts you're talking about and how it's structured. Certainly, on a pay-by-the-drink type of an a la carte contract, carriers would pay us lease by lease as and when they install the equipment or probably better, more precisely said, when the  contract gets executed and the commencement date is triggered. And that's typically when the building permit is pulled in construction starts or certainly by the time that the equipment is installed. If you're looking at more of a holistic transaction, then there's a disconnection between fees and exactly when equipment is put on. You've heard us say it before, in the holistic type of environment, we price out activity over a multiyear period. We know exactly what the carriers want to do and what they are willing to pay for. We give them those rights, and we put a payment cycle to it as well, which we spread out over time, in a little bit more of a consistent manner, so it's not as volatile as the activity. So in that context, you may see payments hit before equipment is installed, and you could also see payments hit after the equipment is installed. It really depends on the payment time line that's in the holistic view."

So and as I just mentioned and is what you've seen from our customers talking about rolling out 5G, it's all on the macro sites. So answer to the question on the technology side is no. We don't see any competing technologies that we'll get in our way there. 
From an inflation perspective, 95% of our contracts in the United States are on a fixed escalator. And my sense is that it's a very important element of our agreements, and that's going to continue to say there are going to be some years when it may be a bit higher, although it's -- it hasn't been for many, many years. And so generally, it's underneath it. But it's also consistent with how we look at our land in terms of the landlord as well. So it's a balance as well between the landlords as well as our customers. So I don't think that there's any unique opportunity to be able to really change that. As you well know, we would really price our contracts where it makes sense for our customers to want to be on our sites. And so we continue to look at our pricing along those lines."

Consistent with our prior 2, 3 calls, my comments today will center on the key trends driving our business now and how we think the technological landscape will develop in the future. I'll touch on how we are positioned to benefit as 5G deployments accelerate in cloud-native applications in the edge of all, particularly in the United States. Additionally, I'll spend some time discussing our European markets, where we now have a scaled presence and are poised to create further value as technology evolves there and then briefly cover what we are seeing in our earlier-stage international markets. Finally, I'll outline some of the progress we've made in some of those same emerging markets in the platform expansion side, particularly with respect to our investments in sustainability and renewable energy as we continue to lead the industry into a greener future.  
At a high level, much of my commentary today will sound familiar to those of you who have listened in on prior technology-focused calls, and we view that as a positive. Technology is evolving and advancing right in line with our expectations. In the long-term secular trends that have driven and continue to drive, our business remains strong. There are also new developments in the marketplace around the overall digital ecosystem that we are excited about and our tenants continue to power ahead with their network augmentation and expansion activities. Taken together, this is a backdrop that we expect will lead to sustained attractive growth for us over the long term.  
Central to this belief is the view that our core global macro tower business will be the foundation of our success and the main driver of our cash flows for the foreseeable future as macro towers should remain the most cost and technology efficient network deployment solution in most topographies worldwide. Our conviction in this regard has only grown stronger over time supported by our customers' significant investments in new spectrum assets, record levels of wireless CapEx spending in markets like the United States and numerous public statements by them indicating their intention to utilize macro sites to drive aggressive deployments of 5G and other wireless technologies globally.  
We continue to view mid-band spectrum, which includes the recently auctioned C-band and the 2.5 gig band currently being deployed in the U.S., as the workhorse of the true 5G experience and we believe to be the fundamental enabler of the immersive next-generation 5G applications and use cases that are set to emerge as coverage improves and advanced devices penetrate the market. 
Importantly, we continue to expect the propagation characteristics of the sub-6 gig frequencies compared to traditionally deployed mobile spectrum to necessitate significant network densification over the long term supporting a multiyear period of strong growth on our tower sites.  
We're seeing the leading edge of this activity in the U.S. today generating record services revenues driven by all of the major carriers as they accelerate the early stages of their respective 5G deployments. Further, application volumes within our property business are strong, supported by expected wireless CapEx spend in the mid-$30 billion range this year. Industry experts anticipate that these elevated levels of capital spending will be sustained for a number of years driven by a mobile data usage growth CAGR of more than 25% over the next 5 years. Amazingly, this follows a more than 25% CAGR for the last 5 years and cumulative growth of approximately 7,500% over the last decade. This compelling demand backdrop, coupled with the long-term noncancelable leases that comprise are more than $60 billion global contractual backlog, gives us confidence in our ability to drive organic tenant billings growth in the mid-single-digit range on average in the U.S. through 2027 and to drive higher growth rates abroad in that same period.  
I'll touch on this further in a few minutes. But as a quick reminder, these baseline growth expectations exclude any material contributions from our various platform expansion initiatives. What they do include are expectations for an extended period of solid growth in our European markets, where we are seeing similar network growth trends to the United States with early-stage 5G deployments set to accelerate in the coming years. We expect that our newly scaled European presence will allow us to drive long-term value creation as the explosion of mobile data usage across the region continues and the need for communications infrastructure accelerates as a result.  
Across Germany, Spain and France, where 5G mobile subscriptions currently make up less than 5% of the total user base, we expect mobile data usage per smartphone to grow by more than 25% annually for the next 5 years, similar to the United States, and consequently expect CapEx spend across the 3 markets to exceed $11 billion annually over a similar time period. 
And as happened in the United States, we are already seeing this acceleration in network investment translate into elevated activity. In fact, in the third quarter, normalizing for the impacts of the Telxius deal co-location and amendment contributions to European organic tenant billings growth rose by around 200 basis points year-over-year. Although we expect a significant portion of initial 5G investments to be focused in urban locations across our European footprint where roughly 80% of the population resides, we anticipate urban-oriented consumer demand to be complemented by an ongoing push from European regulators to deliver rural connectivity, which will represent another opportunity for us to drive colocation on our tower sites in those areas. We believe our balance of rural and recently expanded urban assets positions us well to capture significant market share of upcoming 5G deployments over the next decade. 
Finally, in our earlier stage markets across Latin America, Asia and Africa, we continue to see solid demand for our critical infrastructure, largely driven by deployments of legacy network technologies, particularly 4G. Whether looking at Brazil, Mexico, India or Nigeria, consumers are rapidly increasing their utilization of smartphones, thereby driving mobile data usage growth higher. In many of these regions, existing network infrastructure is insufficient to support this deluge of usage as sell-side performance is challenged with increased levels of network load. In response to these trends, we are aggressively marketing our existing assets and continue to look for additional acquisition opportunities to bolster our footprint in these markets.
But at the same time, we have significantly ramped up our new build program given the tremendous need for entirely new infrastructure. In fact, if you take the nearly 5,900 sites we built last year and add our expected 7,000 sites at the midpoint of our outlook to be constructed this year, it would represent almost as many sites as the previous 5 years combined. And as we laid out a few quarters ago, we are targeting the construction of up to 40,000 to 50,000 new sites over the next 5 years. With day 1 NOI yields on these builds continuing to average above 10%, we are excited about deploying significant capital to these initiatives going forward as we capitalize on the advancement of network technology across the emerging world while helping to connect billions of people.  
In addition to the core secular growth trends driving our global tower business, we are seeing indications, particularly in more mature markets like the United States, of a broad evolution within the overall wireless ecosystem. This evolution is closely intertwined with 5G and includes an increased prevalence of cloud-native network solutions, more emphasis on the various permutations of the network edge and an ever-increasing intersection of the wired and wireless portions of today's converged network architecture.  
As networks virtualize, O-RAN or Open RAN, it's expected to become a more important option to improve their economics. We are now starting to see this phenomenon with DISH in the United States, and in Germany, where 1&1 has spoken extensively about its intent to utilize this technology. By utilizing O-RAN, carriers have the potential to optimize network design and drive cost efficiencies, freeing up incremental capital to invest in densification and other network enhancements that help drive growth in site deployments and colocations.  
Importantly, the role of the tower in this evolving network design is as critical as ever. While base station functionality will likely continue to evolve to be cloud native software agile, the radio equipment that is placed on the tower itself, which has always driven our revenue, will continue to reside on the tower. Importantly, we believe we can leverage our extensive global distributed real estate portfolio to not only drive continued strong growth within our core tower business but also to take advantage of other emerging opportunities as networks virtualize. This may include multi-access edge computing and potential other edge cloud permutations of neutral host infrastructure. 
At the end of the day, modern software-driven networks are becoming smarter, faster, more capable and more dynamic and we are focused on ensuring that American Tower has a meaningful role to play in this context on the infrastructure and real estate side of the equation. One of the areas we focused on is the development of the network edge or, more accurately, the development of multiple layers of the network edge with the need for lower latency expected to become more and more critical over time with applications like AR, VR, telemedicine, real-time analytics, autonomous driving, entertainment, streaming, you name it, and many others are beginning to emerge, we continue to believe that this can be a meaningful opportunity for American Tower. As we've done more work on the evolution of the edge, the concept of multiple edge layers has come into better focus. 
Today, for example, by far the most prevalent layer is the regional metro edge owned, for the most part, by the large data center companies where vast amounts of data processing is then centralized. These locations provide access to cloud on-ramps and are absolutely critical within today's networks. We expect this need to be the case for the foreseeable future. In fact, as the volume of data carried across networks continues to explode, we anticipate the demand for these types of large-scale facilities will only grow. The upside of these locations is their size and capacity. The downside, to this point, hasn't been all that relevant, is a fairly significant network transit costs and latency built into reaching these central compute functions as the data often has to travel hundreds of miles to reach these destinations. These transit costs and latency considerations, which we expect to become more important in the future, will necessitate more edge locations as uplink data increases from IoT use cases and demands for distributed computing advance. 
The next layer beyond the metro edge, in our view, will be the aggregation edge. Here, you're likely to post C-RAN hubs and future MEC applications as network virtualization advances, along with distributed data processing, AI inferencing and other compute functions which will need reduced latency. The major hyperscalers continue to evolve their edge cloud platforms so that they can extend computing capabilities deeper into the mobile access network at the aggregation edge. 
The next layer beyond this, which we turn the access edge is where our existing tower sites are located today, offering an opportunity to meaningfully enhance the value of our legacy real estate. We expect to eventually see vRAN and O-RAN network functions, AI inferencing, data caching and a variety of other next-generation AR and VR cloud-native ultra-low-latency applications residing at these locations. 
Finally, we've also identified the on-premise edge, which would lie beyond even our tower sites and could eventually help support private networks, smart factories and a host of other applications located at the end-user site. At the end of the day, our 20,000-foot view is that all of these edge elements will need to fit together to provide a cohesive framework for full-scale 5G across the network ecosystem. The goal for us is to figure out what the optimal linkages between the layers look like, who the key players will be and what elements of the edge we may want to own in order to further enhance the strong long-term growth we expect from our core existing business. 
To date, as we seek to connect the dots, we've been active with a number of trial edge compute sites at the access edge while also operating our Colo ATL metro data center interconnection facility in Atlanta. Through these investments, we have built relationships with key existing and potential future customers, have learned a tremendous amount about key demand trends and have had a front-row seat for the beginning stages of the convergence of wireless and wireline networks that I alluded to earlier.  
More recently, we acquired DataSite, a data center company consisting of 2 multi-tenant data centers in the Atlanta area and in Orlando. In addition to strengthening our existing position in Atlanta, the addition of a network dense carrier hotel facility in Orlando provides us with a strong Southeastern presence with the profile and characteristics that we believe will be critical in the early evolution of the metro edge as we evaluate its role in the mobile networks of the future. We expect these facilities, which have 18 megawatts of combined power, an additional 4.5 megawatts of expansion capacity, to effectively complement Colo ATL and enable us to enhance our ability to develop neutral-host, multi-operator, multi-cloud data centers to support the broader core to edge connectivity evolution in the United States. We continue to believe that while a scaled application-driven edge-oriented business model is still likely several years away, it has the potential to be a sizable market opportunity with meaningful potential upside not only in the United States but also on a global basis.  
Leading global MNOs are now positioning their networks with released 16 5G stand-alone core features to explore edge cloud opportunities. And with our distributed macro side presence in key markets around the world, we think we are well positioned to potentially be a provider of choice on the edge, particularly for large multi-national MNOs and other categories of customers who may be looking for a multi-market solution.  
Switching gears a bit. While we believe edge compute will eventually also be relevant in emerging markets, it is unlikely to happen in the immediate future. Consequently, we have focused our platform expansion efforts across our developing regions and other areas, most notably on increasing the sustainability and efficiency of power provisioning in our sites. As we highlighted in our recently published 2020 corporate sustainability report, we've continued to make progress toward our goal of reducing diesel-related greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2027 from a 2017 baseline. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019, reaching 53% of the 10-year goal. We are continuing to make solid progress in 2021 with an expectation to spend an additional $80 million towards energy-efficient solutions, primarily in lithium ion and solar power across our Africa footprint, which will bring our cumulative spend to nearly $250 million. 
And as we announced earlier this week, we are furthering our commitment to combat climate change by adopting science-based targets, which we expect to help inform our future investments in sustainability. In addition to the positive environmental benefits from these investments, we are also delivering shareholder value through AFFO per share accretion. Lithium ion batteries provide significant energy efficiency, density and lifespan improvements over legacy solutions. And while to date, AFFO benefits to American Tower have largely come through fuel savings, we anticipate over time that our yields on these investments will further expand as we are able to lengthen battery and generator replacement cycles. Having already expanded our lithium ion-powered site count from 4,500 in 2019 to 6,700 in 2020, we are targeting another 8,000 sites by the end of 2022 and recently signed a multimillion dollar bulk battery purchase agreement in Africa in support of this goal.  
Importantly, we believe that energy efficiency, the use of renewables and sustainability in our broader sense can represent an important competitive advantage for us not only from the flow-through to AFFO but also the differentiation in service quality for our customers. We continue to view sustainability as a critical component of our company culture, and we'll be highlighting our continued progress in future sustainability reports, which I encourage all of you to read by the way. 
In closing, our excitement around 5G on a global basis continues to grow. Consumers and enterprises are using more advanced devices for more things, resulting in consistent elevated growth in mobile data usage, which, in turn, strains existing wireless networks and necessitates incremental densification and network improvement. Considerable new spectrum is being deployed, new entrants in select markets are building greenfield networks, and our macro tower-oriented portfolio remains well positioned to capture a significant portion of wireless investment activity. In addition, through our platform expansion strategy, we are focused on ensuring that the company benefits from the ongoing convergence of wireless and wireline and the associated expansion of virtualization in cloud-native applications throughout the network ecosystem. 
Importantly, as we optimize our core business and look for ways to further enhance our growth path in the broader digital infrastructure world, we are as committed as ever to driving profitability, sustainability and recurring growth. We're energized by the future and are excited to be in a vibrant industry that is helping to connect the world.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Rod to go through our third quarter results and updated full year 2021 outlook. Rod?"

I hope you and your families are well. Q3 was another quarter of strong performance for us. And as you heard from Tom, we are as encouraged as ever by the technological trends that underpin our long-term growth potential. 
Before digging into the details of our results and raised outlook, I'd like to touch on a few highlights from the quarter. First, we closed on our strategic partnership agreements with CDPQ and Allianz through which they purchased an aggregate of 48% of our ATC Europe business for a total consideration of around EUR 2.6 billion. In addition, we closed the remaining 4,000 Telxius communication sites in Germany back in August. With the transaction now fully closed and funded, our teams are working to rapidly integrate the assets, and we are already seeing encouraging activity on the portfolio. 
Second, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, raising roughly $3 billion in senior unsecured notes, including our euro offering earlier this month. Through our financing transactions, we have been able to maintain an attractive weighted average cost of debt while also continuing to extend our maturities. As a result of this activity, along with the benefit from a nonrecurring advance payment received from a tenant during the quarter, we finished Q3 with net leverage of 4.9x. While we expect net leverage to increase back into the low 5x range in the fourth quarter, we are right on track with our overall post-Telxius delevering path. 
And lastly, we saw another quarter of record services activity in the U.S. as carriers accelerated 5G-related projects. We view this as a leading indicator of strong levels of gross leasing in our property segment as we head into 2022 and beyond. And with that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our Q3 property revenue and organic tenant billings growth.  
As you can see, our consolidated property revenue grew by over 19% year-over-year or over 18% on an FX-neutral basis to nearly $2.4 billion. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of around 10% and international property revenue growth of over 31% or 13% when excluding the impacts of the Telxius acquisition. This strong performance is indicative of a continuation of the long-term secular trends driving demand for our infrastructure assets across the globe. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we also had a solid quarter of organic tenant billings growth throughout the business. On a consolidated basis, organic tenant billings growth was nearly 5% for a second consecutive quarter. As expected, U.S. 5G investments from the major carriers drove healthy activity levels, leading to organic tenant billings growth in our U.S. and Canada segment of over 4%. Contributions from colocation and amendments were more than 3%. Escalators came in at 3.2% and churn was just over 2%. 
Moving to our international operations. We drove organic tenant billings growth of nearly 6% reflecting a sequential acceleration of around 60 basis points. Africa was our fastest growing region in the quarter, posting organic tenant billings growth of well over 9% led by Nigeria, where we continue to see 4G investments driving both colocation activity and new site construction. We also saw a consistent quarter in Latin America, where organic tenant billings growth was right around 7% driven by solid new business and higher escalators primarily in Brazil.  
Meanwhile, European organic tenant billings growth accelerated by around 100 basis points sequentially to nearly 5.5% as expected. Excluding impacts from the Telxius acquisition, organic tenant billings growth in the region would have been over 4.5% in the quarter, more than 200 basis points higher than the year ago period, driven primarily by new business contributions. This positive trend reflects both ongoing 4G activity and early 5G investments leading to solid growth from both colocations and amendments. 
Looking to Germany, in particular, we saw a more than 300 basis point increase in colocation and amendment contributions in our legacy business as compared to the prior year period, resulting in organic tenant billings growth of over 5.5%, up from 5.2% in the second quarter. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we saw organic tenant billings growth of 0.7%, up roughly 200 basis points as compared to Q2. This reflects a modest acceleration in gross new business activity, coupled with a more than 2% sequential decline in churn, which was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew more than 19% or over 18% on an FX-neutral basis to nearly $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.2%, which was down compared to Q3 2020 as a result of adding new lower initial tenancy assets to our portfolio, which we believe will drive strong organic growth and, therefore, margin expansion in the future. Cash SG&A as a percent of total property revenue was around 7.3%, a roughly 40 basis point sequential improvement. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, consolidated AFFO growth was over 13% with consolidated AFFO per share of $2.53, reflecting a per share growth of nearly 11%. This was driven by strong performance in our core business, contributions from new assets and around $13 million in year-over-year FX favorability. Our performance also reflected the benefits of our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our operations and minimizing financing costs despite growing the portfolio by nearly 38,000 sites over the last year. And finally, AFFO per share attributable to AMT common stockholders was $2.49, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of nearly 12%. 
Let's now turn to our updated outlook for the full year. I'll start by reviewing a few of the key updated assumptions. First, our expectations for organic growth across the business are consistent with our prior outlook. Carriers continue to deploy meaningful capital as they invest in network quality, and we are seeing numerous bands of spectrum being deployed for both 4G and 5G. We are also slightly increasing our expectations for services revenue for the year to around $235 million as a result of an outsized third quarter, although this implies that services volumes will moderate somewhat in Q4.  
Second, as a result of our focus on operational efficiency and cost controls, along with some onetime benefits, we expect to be able to take some costs out of the business as compared to our prior expectations. Combined with the current services gross margin outperformance, this will drive our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations higher for the balance of the year. 
Third, in India, we are encouraged by recent regulatory reforms, which we believe can provide some much-needed breathing room for capital-constrained carriers in the marketplace and improve the telecom environment overall. While we believe this is a clear positive first step towards market recovery, we continue to expect flat 2021 organic tenant billings growth in the region as we further evaluate the long-term impacts of these developments on the sector. 
Finally, incorporating the latest FX projections, our current outlook reflects negative FX impacts of $30 million for property revenue, $20 million for adjusted EBITDA and $15 million for consolidated AFFO as compared to our prior expectations. With that, let's move to the details of our revised full year outlook. Looking at Slide 8, as expected, leasing trends remained strong across our global business, and as a result of an increase in pass-through, together with some modest core property revenue outperformance, we are raising our property revenue outlook by $10 million. This represents 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and includes $30 million in unfavorable translational FX impacts as compared to our prior outlook. 
Moving to Slide 9. You'll see that we are reiterating our organic tenant billings growth expectations of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. This includes roughly 3% growth in our U.S. and Canada segment where 5G deployments are driving solid activity levels as we exit the year. As a reminder, we expect the first and largest tranche of contractual Sprint churn to hit our run rate in the fourth quarter of this year. And while we expect gross activity to remain solid, our guide implies a Q4 U.S. organic tenant billings growth rate of negative 1%, as we communicated previously. 
On the international side, we continue to anticipate organic tenant billings growth in the range of 5% to 6% as carriers continue to focus their efforts on enhancing and densifying wireless networks in the face of ever-rising mobile data demand. Moving to Slide 10. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $50 million and now expect year-over-year growth of nearly 16%. This increase reflects continued strength in our Services segment, where we now expect to see roughly $145 million in services gross margin for the year, up from the $123 million implied in our prior guidance with year-over-year growth of more than 180%. 
On the cost side of the equation, we continue to maintain cost discipline globally, helping to drive adjusted EBITDA margins up by around 40 basis points for the full year as compared to prior expectations. Turning to Slide 11. We are also raising our full year AFFO expectations and now expect year-over-year growth in consolidated AFFO of roughly 15% with an implied outlook midpoint of $9.64 per share. The flow-through of incremental cash-adjusted EBITDA, coupled with the continued cash tax and net cash interest benefits as compared to the prior expectations are being partially offset by around $15 million in negative translational FX impacts. 
On a per share basis, we now expect growth of approximately 14% for the year consistent with our long-term growth ambitions that we highlighted at the start of the year. Finally, AFFO attributable to ATC common stockholders per share is expected to grow by nearly 12% versus 2020, incorporating the minority interest impacts of our strategic partnership with CDPQ and Allianz in Europe. 
Moving on to Slide 12. Let's review our capital deployment expectations for 2021. As you can see, we remain focused on deploying capital towards assets that drive strong sustainable growth in AFFO per share coupled with a growing dividend, providing our investors with a compelling combination of growth plus yield. Working our way through the specific categories, our first priority remains our dividend. For the full year, we continue to expect to distribute $2.3 billion, subject to Board approval, which implies a roughly 15% year-over-year per share growth rate. As a reminder, our dividend growth will continue to be driven by underlying growth in our REIT taxable income, incorporating the impacts of M&A and other moving pieces in the business. Consistent with our prior comments, we anticipate growing our dividend by at least 10% annually in the coming years. 
Moving on to CapEx, we reiterate our expectations of spending nearly $1.6 billion at the midpoint with nearly 90% being discretionary in nature. Driving a good portion of this discretionary CapEx is our continued expectation to construct 7,000 sites at the midpoint this year with the vast majority in our international markets. 
Turning to acquisitions. Including contributions from minority partners, we have deployed around $10 billion so far this year primarily for the Telxius transaction as well as for smaller transactions, including DataSite. In total, of our nearly $14 billion in expected capital deployments for the year, we expect over 80% to be composed of discretionary growth CapEx and M&A. 
Moving to the center of the slide. You can see the composition of our $35 billion in cumulative capital deployments since the start of 2017, including our 2021 full year expectations. We continue to augment our developed market presence, which we believe positions us optimally to drive value from accelerating 5G deployments and next-generation technology evolutions, as Tom laid out earlier. 
We are also allocating capital towards higher growth earlier-stage markets that are typically at least 5 years behind the U.S. and Europe in their network deployments. Taken together, we believe that our global footprint positions us to capture multiple waves of investments across the globe over a sustained period of time. 
Finally, you can see that more than 1/4 or around $9.5 billion of our deployed capital in the last 5 years has been distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to view these components as critical to total shareholder returns. 
Moving to the right side of the chart. Supporting this phase of significant investment and growth has been our investment-grade balance sheet. We believe that our access to low-cost, diversified sources of financing has been a key differentiator and are proactively working to extend this critical competitive advantage into the future. In fact, incorporating our latest financing efforts, we now have a weighted average cost of debt of around 2.4%, a weighted average tenor of debt of approximately 7 years and over 85% of our balance sheet locked into fixed rate instruments. 
Finally, on Slide 13, and in summary, in Q3, we continue to capitalize on a strong global demand backdrop, delivering our highest quarter of consolidated AFFO per share on record. This was driven by solid organic growth, record-setting services volumes, disciplined cost controls, strategic balance sheet management and accretive portfolio expansion. As we look ahead, we believe our existing global real estate portfolio is well positioned to drive long-term recurring growth as carriers augment and extend their networks. And with the strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and diversified pool of funding sources, we expect to continue to deploy capital towards accretive investments that can enhance our growth path and enable us to create additional value.  
Given our positioning at the intersection of real estate and technology in an ever more interconnected world, we are excited to continue to deliver connectivity to billions of people worldwide in a sustainable way while driving compelling total returns for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

The first question is on the domestic environment. Just curious if you can give us an update on U.S. leasing, how it compared to your prior expectations entering into this year and what that means for the average organic tenant billings growth guidance that you provided? I think the average for '21 and '22 was about 2% on a reported basis and about 5% on a normalized basis. And then just, Tom, to follow up on your comments on the edge and data centers, is it inevitable that American Tower needs to either partner with a larger data center portfolio or directly own a larger data center portfolio?"

So in terms of the U.S. leasing environment, we're seeing a very strong environment. Certainly, all the major carriers have been active. You've seen that show up most notably in our services environment. We've seen a tick-up in the contribution from colocation and amendment activity into our organic tenant billings growth. So that's been accelerating through each of the last 3 quarters, just as we expected from the outset in the year. So in terms of our expectations, everything really is right in line with what we expected. 
I don't want to get too deep into the second part of your question around growth and activity when it comes to 2022. But I will just reiterate a couple of points that we've already made. So directionally, your comments are correct. We guided to an average organic tenant billings growth in the U.S. for '21 and '22 of around 2%. You can see we're coming in here in '21 at around 3%. That suggests around 1% organic tenant billings growth for 2022 in the U.S. So that's where we would expect to be. And again, I'm not providing guidance for next year, just reiterating the components of our long-term plan. 
And maybe one thing that I will kind of highlight here just briefly is that Sprint churn hit us in Q4 for the first time, that first tranche, as you heard in my comments. So Sprint churn, now that it's active, I'll just give you the numbers there, again. 2021, we are rolling off $195 million of annual Sprint revenue and churn. In 2022, we'll roll off an additional $60 million. 2023, we'll roll off another $50 million. And in 2024, we'll roll off another $70 million. So that's Sprint churn here. That's what's really causing the lower organic growth rates in our U.S. business next year. The gross growth, we see the environment being very strong, accelerating through 2021, and we expect that to continue going in. 
Just to give you a couple of the piece parts. In terms of the impact it will have in the fourth quarter, you will see organic kind of billings growth rates in the U.S. at around a negative 1%. That will include churn for the quarter of about 6.6%, and embedded within that is about 4.5% just from the Sprint churn. And of course, all this will have an impact on AFFO in terms of going forward into future years. So we've guided that. Our goal is to hit double-digit AFFO growth on average from 2021 out through 2027. And of course, some years, it will be higher. Some years, it will be lower. The goal really is an average. 
And when you think about 2022 when this first tranche of Sprint churn kind of rolling through, that's a year that I would say that it would be challenging to get to 10%. I'll also say, Michael, we haven't given up on it. There are certain levers that we can pull and things that we can do within the business to maximize AFFO and AFFO per share growth, and we're doing all of those things. So that kind of puts a little bit of context around the U.S. activity for this year and rolling into next year."

I mean, the impetus right now is really 5G and driving all of these lower latency types of applications and needs out further into the market closer and closer to the end user. We've always said, from a digital transformation perspective, it's going to be cloud-based, it's going to be connected and it's going to be distributed. And we think we're in a very good competitive position given the vast amount of distribution that we have in the 25 markets that we're servicing. So we're trying to position ourselves in this broader market to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. 
We're going to do it intelligently. Our execution strategy continues to evolve. We think we've done it intelligently in terms of picking up some of the metro sites, building out our own sites. We have some market agreements in place to drive access into those sites, and this is going to evolve. This is not going to happen overnight, as you well know. And so we've got partnerships in place to be able to look at this. We're going to be able to hopefully leverage some of those partnerships, and we'll just continue to monitor the best approach in terms of being able to best position ourselves to be able to take advantage of this opportunity. We've done that in the past in terms of being smart, in terms of how we allocate capital to these types of investments. Will it take the form of partnerships owning -- further owning more metro sites, unclear at this point in time. That will continue to evolve as the market continues to evolve. But we do think we're in a really good position in terms of being able to leverage our real estate, our exclusive real estate and to be able to take advantage of that neutral host model."

So with the advanced prepayment, I'm not going to provide details around that. I will say it was a little over $1 billion from one of our customers. It really is just a prepayment for lease payments going out over, let's say, the next 12 months. So it will kind of run through our financial statements pretty quickly. And there's nothing more to it than just a prepayment of the next 12 months kind of leasing fees. 
So from our perspective, it's not a big deal. It helps with liquidity. It brought our leverage down a little bit. You saw we ended a little bit below 5x in terms of leverage. So it wasn't a bad thing for us to do, but it's a pretty simple transaction. And I wouldn't want you to read any more into it than that. 
In terms of supply chain, Tom, maybe you want to add a few comments here, but from a supply chain, we see no major impacts at this point, certainly across our business. As you can see in our Services business, we continue to hit higher and higher levels of activity in bringing our outlook up again to the -- another consecutive quarter here. So we've got access to the crews. You've also seen our margins expanding in the Services business in particular. And in the U.S., we're not building a tremendous amount of tower. So we certainly don't have any restrictions or challenges from that perspective. 
One place I would say -- going into 2022, we will be keeping our eye on crew availability and labor and things like that. If the environment stays the way it is, we should be fine. If things get worse, we'll need to keep our eye on it. We do buy a lot of generators. We have generator orders out that are already in place that bring us out into the beginning to the middle of 2022. So from that perspective, we know we're going to get the materials we need, and we expect to get the materials we need and feel pretty good about that.

So we posted a 0.7% positive growth rate. We're still looking for the full year to be right around 0. And as we look at the market, we remain optimistic in terms of the gross activity. 
So the way that even that 0.7% organic tenant billings for the quarter, I'll give you a little bit of the breakdown there. So we're seeing high single digits, nearly double-digit organic new business. That's been pretty consistent for at least 6 to 8 consecutive quarters. And based on where they are in their development kind of transitioning from 3G to 4G networks, we expect that, that gross demand should continue. The escalators are locked in right around 2% to 2.2% or so, so we have that account. And we have seen a moderation in a pretty sharp decline here year-over-year in terms of the churn rate. So a year ago, Q3 churn in India was about 13.5%. It's down now to about 7.5%. We think that's certainly a very favorable sign and one that we expected to see, and we hope to continue to see that going forward. 
In terms of the -- you did see that there was some good news from the government in terms of regulatory support for the industry. And we think that, that will help the market in general, the whole sector as well as the carriers, particularly the ones with the AGR dues, but all the carriers even with your spectrum fees, strengthen their own balance sheets, kind of regroup and gear up for competition in the sector there and to invest in the networks. So we are optimistic about going forward growth rates there, but we would expect, let's call it, high single-digit organic growth with churn levels there in the mid-single digits and hopefully moderating down over time."

You've seen a couple of sequential quarters of increased organic growth rates, just as we expected to see now that the market has kind of seen a reduction in churn, they're gearing up for 5G deployment. So that's been really good to see. 
In terms of the piece parts of the organic tenant billings, certainly, the Telefónica additional sites plays a role in there. One of the biggest ways that it plays in early on, it's still very early in terms of bringing those assets in. But I think we've talked before about the assets there in Europe that --they basically have a long-term contract, and there are other tenant -- material other tenants on there. So there's really very little churn that will -- that's possible on that portfolio. So we have very low churn expectations on that portfolio, and it's a big chunk of revenue. That certainly helps kind of inflect the growth rates to go up higher. And then in terms of the question with Drillisch, 1&1, we really don't want to comment on ongoing negotiations, but negotiations continue there. I can assure you."

With regards to Europe, we think we have a really solid position in a few of the critical markets. We've got good scale in the market.

But we continue to look at opportunities to further build scale not just in the 3 markets that we're in but also if there are other opportunities, but only if it makes sense, like everything else that we do. 
And so there are, I think, a lot of opportunities in the region, and we're evaluating them as you would expect. And to the extent that there's some opportunities there to secure some of that portfolio to gain further scale even in the markets that we're in and relationships with key customers, we'll clearly look to do that. And so Europe is, as we've said, an area or part of the world that we look to continue to further develop, if it makes sense. 
With regards to Telefónica, again, we've got a great global relationship with them. They're positioning to an MVNO, as you all know, and they're going to have some time for that to be able to -- for that to occur. There will be some churn over time, but the contract that we have with them, I think goes out for several years at this point in time. And so we'll continue to monitor that.

Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So let's hit interest rates first. So you've seen us, Rick, over the last several quarters, even the last couple of years, very active in the capital markets, very active in terms of our debt structure, capital structure and different things like that. So we've been focused on strengthening our balance sheet in a very proactive way. So we now have our average maturities out over about 7 years with an average cost of debt down to about 2.4% or so. And 85% of our debt is now fixed out over the long term. So that's a heavier weighting to expect to variable compared to our kind of standard financial policy. So we've been preparing for an environment where interest rates may tick up. So we think from an interest rate perspective, our balance sheet is very solid and ready for it. There's nothing we can do about preventing interest rates from rising. We do think they may rise over time modestly, but we're very well prepared for it. 
The other thing I would add is in terms of global capital allocation and looking to invest capital, the strength of our balance sheet really does represent a competitive advantage for us, particularly in a time when interest rates may be rising. So we'll keep an eye on that and look to be very opportunistic as we go forward from that perspective. 
And then when you think about inflation rates, one of the ways you'll see that run through our business is many of our contracts internationally, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are all geared towards inflation rates and the escalator is adjusted based on inflation rate. So as and when we see higher levels of inflation in the international markets, we'll see higher levels of growth as well. 
In the U.S., I'd remind you that our escalators are fixed at around 3%. That's been consistent for a long time. So we're pretty well insulated from interest rates rising in the U.S. from a balance sheet perspective, but we still lock in that revenue growth of 3% on the U.S. escalator."

I mean, there are probably a dozen different elements of that evaluation that go into deciding whether, in fact, we would be interested and then driving what that price is. We've used the same 10-year discounted cash flow approach and continue to use it. Obviously, the variables change but largely -- I mean, the actual numbers, but largely the variables themselves, from a qualification perspective, are the same.

Overall, if you look at our total portfolio, the last count I did, we own about 1/3 of the inventory in all of the markets. And so there's still a lot of opportunity in the markets that we're in, given how carriers, our existing customers' carriers are looking at -- continually looking at trying to monetize their portfolio. Smaller towercos are looking for opportunities to exit. There is private capital involved in some of those smaller towercos, and so they're looking to monetize some of their funds, some increased opportunity in Southeast Asia that's going on as we speak, as you've well seen. 
But it's been -- the pipeline has been very consistent. I would say, where it's a little bit outsized is probably all of the noise is going on in Western Europe.

We also brought in private capital. It maybe a good time to just kind of level set that. So for the full year, we're looking -- you can see in our presentation in terms of AFFO attributable to our minority shareholders is about $100 million. That breaks down $75 million roughly for the European business and about $25 million for the India business. 
The way our partners kind of break down is you know CDPQ owns 30% of our European business and Allianz owns about 18% of that business. PGGM holds about 17% in Germany and about 13% in Spain. And we have Macquarie as a partner over in India, they own about 8%. Now is a good time to kind of think about the run rate aspect of that minority interest. When you look at Q4, now that all the dust has settled, we think the run rate -- a good ballpark run rate is about $40 million for Q4. So if you annualize that, you get a range of $150 million to $160 million that would be attributable to the minority interest partners. 
The one word to your question, I would say, is we will -- we did receive the put for Macquarie. You've seen that in our filings. So we will eventually close on that, and that will be an adjustment to the numbers at that time."

We've got a pretty robust build program there. So you've seen the guide with 7,000 sites that we expect to build. There is a good chunk of those in Africa, a lot of them are in Nigeria.

And so we'll look to continue to dialogue. And if they're looking for more à la carte type of pricing, we'll go in that direction. If they're looking for renewal of holistic, we'll go in that direction. So more to come but they're very active in the marketplace. They're very aggressive in terms of building out their network, and I think we've seen it. They talked about it. And they're doing a terrific job, and we're here to support them however best we can."

So first, how long does it take to typically get acquired carrier owned sites or I guess, in the case of Telxius, quasi carrier owned sites kind of plugged into your systems and effectively marketed so that you really see the lease improvements from being independently owned flow-through? And will it happen faster than normal for Telxius since, again, they were kind of quasi independent before you picked them up? 
And then second, in the U.S., we oftentimes talk about urban markets seeing activity first with spectrum deployments, especially for like the upper mid-band spectrum that the carrier deployed today in force. Are you seeing that play out in practice across your portfolio? Or is it more even than we might suspect?"

So we're as aggressive as we possibly can in terms of providing those sites out to our customers. I mean, the integration has gone really well, I think and it takes time from a system perspective in getting that all organized, getting them into systems and integrating systems and things like that. And that can take 6 months to 1 year. But that doesn't prevent us from marketing those sites to our customers and making them available to all of our customers. We'll be aggressive from a capital perspective to the extent that there are some sites that we need to attend to, to -- from a structural perspective to be able to support them. 
But as I've said all along, I mean, this was a really terrifically built portfolio, and that was one of the attractions to the portfolio to begin with. So we're being as aggressive as we can to really be able to take advantage of these sites, particularly in markets like Germany and Spain, where 5G is really picking up. 
From a U.S. perspective, you're right. I mean, if you go back to even the old analog days, I mean, the markets were generally built up from your urban markets because that's where you're able to get the best bang for the buck when you're rolling out capital. This one, though, I would say with 5G is broader. I mean, it is a goal to get nationwide coverage for all the customers and then to continue to fill it in as demand and as capacity requirements are required. 
What's not a surprise to us, and then I reiterated in my comments, that macro towers is the main asset that our customers are deploying 5G on. And I never had any doubts of that simply -- I mean, I've been involved in the industry for 30 years. So the macro tower is just the best way for our customers to get that signal out to their customers, and so we're seeing that. But we are seeing it more across the entire country, again, as customers are really trying to be able to get to that nationwide coverage."

Are there any that you think are a risk to the business model that you're concerned about or watching?"

So Tim, I would say that it really works in a variety of ways depending on which contracts you're talking about and how it's structured. Certainly, on a pay-by-the-drink type of à la carte contract, carriers would pay us lease by lease as and when they install the equipment or probably better, more precisely said, when the contract gets executed and the commencement date is triggered. And that's typically when the building permit is pulled and construction starts or certainly by the time that the equipment is installed. 
If you're looking at more of a holistic transaction, then there's a disconnection between fees and exactly when equipment is put on. You've heard us say it before, in the holistic type of environment, we price out activity over a multiyear period. We know exactly what the carriers want to do and what they are willing to pay for. 
We give them those rights and we put a payment cycle to it as well, which we spread out over time, in a little bit more of a consistent manner, so it's not as volatile as the activity. So in that context, you may see payments hit before equipment is installed, and you could also see payments hit after the equipment is installed. It really depends on the payment time line that's in the holistic view."

Relative to technology, we have a number of technology consultants that we can -- we use that I talk with weekly as well as all of our own internal. We continue, as I said before, believe that, that macro site is the most efficient way for customers worldwide to be able to deploy their networks and continue to be so. And as I just mentioned and is what you've seen from our customers talking about rolling out 5G, it's all on the macro sites. So teh answer to the question on the technology side is no, we don't see any competing technologies that we'll get in our way there. 
From an inflation perspective, 95% of our contracts in the United States are on a fixed escalator. And my sense is that it's a very important element of our agreements, and that's going to continue to say there are going to be some years when it may be a bit higher, although it hasn't been for many, many years. And so generally, it's underneath it. But it's also consistent with how we look at our land in terms of the landlord as well. So it's a balance as well between the landlords as well as our customers. So I don't think that there's any unique opportunity to be able to really change that. As you well know, we would really price our contracts where it makes sense for our customers to want to be on our sites. And so we continue to look at our pricing along those lines."
