Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. The call will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and the transcript. 
Once again, I'd like to direct you to the earnings slide this quarter. They now contain the metrics and color that we have historically included in Blake's remarks.

I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We've delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter, and we are raising",1910,"Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We've delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter, and we are raising guidance today for the remainder of FY '21. 
After starting this fiscal year with guidance for $5.55 billion in net bookings, we're now expecting to achieve nearly $6.1 billion in net bookings for the full year, and we are projecting growth in our business to continue next fiscal year. 
We're delivering exceptional high-quality experiences across the unmatched breadth and depth of our portfolio. We are driving growth through our live services, and we are reaching new players by bringing our content and subscription to more platforms. 
Drilling down on these growth drivers. EA SPORTS is at the core of the sports experience for hundreds of millions of fans. More and more people, especially younger Gen Z players add now the finest sports tandem through the games they play like FIFA, Madden, NHL and UFC. 
In the past fiscal year, we've had more than 230 million people engaged with our EA SPORTS franchises and content. We delivered 6 new high-quality sports games in FY '21, including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21 on the new Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, ushering in a new generation of sports games. 
FIFA continues to grow on every platform. We set a new record of nearly 6 million daily active players in FIFA Ultimate Team in December, and FUT matches have grown a staggering 177% year-over-year. FIFA Online 4 in Korea has had higher player acquisition in every quarter of this year compared to last year. And we now have nearly 21 million players in FIFA Mobile Asia. 
We are driving growth across our EA SPORTS portfolio. Madden NFL has more players engaged in the franchise than ever before. NHL engagement is up 13% year-over-year. And since launch, UFC 4 has consistently had 20% more daily players than our previous game. EA SPORTS is at the center of innovation, both in our games as well as how fans are connecting through our games to their friends and through the sports they love. For example, in a year where an in-person Pro Bowl event was not possible, we worked with our NFL partners to create the first ever virtual Pro Bowl in Madden NFL 21. This was a groundbreaking experience for fans, where playing Madden actually helped to select 2 global players. The Pro Bowl itself then took place in Madden NFL 21 with the Shawn Watson and Collamer leading teams of NFL Stars in highly entertaining broadcast that aired on Twitch the NFL Network and NFL social channels last Sunday. Now that Super Bowl is just a few days away and we're preparing new content in and outside non-NFL for the increasing number of players engaging with our franchise around the NFL's championship game. Events like this year's Pro Bowl demonstrate how real-world sports experiences are evolving to become interactive, and you can expect to see us continue to lead here. 
Our fans are telling us that they want more of what EA SPORTS can deliver. They're playing more of our games than ever before. They're spending more time with our content, and they're connecting with each other, the players and teams and sport they love through our experiences. 
We have now set to build on our leadership position with an aggressive expansion planned for EA SPORTS. We have important announcements we are making today and more that we expect to make in the weeks ahead that will lead to more great games and content of fans and significant new growth to our company. We have a major global expansion of our soccer business underway. As the scale of our EA SPORTS FIFA player audience expands, including a growing Gen Z population, we will offer more great content on more platforms with our long-standing partners across all the top leads and teams in the sport. We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories, including Russia, Poland and Turkey, with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with 6 new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres. 
EA SPORTS is the premier partner for football organizations, leagues and teams around the world. And today, we are announcing that EA SPORTS FIFA will continue to be the exclusive partner of UEFA Champions League football. As part of our renewed partnership with UEFA, we'll also be launching new EA SPORTS competitions, and we'll have even more news in this space in the months ahead. 
We're bringing new types of experiences to market that will expand the genre. In partnership with KLAD, we are developing a groundbreaking new mobile experience inspired by the Japanese market, which we believe will have global appeal. 
We're thrilled to announce today that EA SPORTS is returning to college football. So many fans have been asking us to please bring back college football video games. Their passion for this top-selling sports franchise has never wavered. We love college football as well. And today, we're very excited to say, ""Yes, we are coming back."" 
We have started work on an all-new next-gen experience working closely with our exclusive licensing partners at CLC to include the universities, logos, venues and game day traditions that fans know and love in college football. We will grow the EA SPORTS portfolio to include experiences in more sports for more fans around the world. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll make more announcements about our expansion in a different sports, including at least one new experience that will launch next fiscal year. 
We're also incredibly excited to build a rating powerhouse with our proposed acquisition of Codemasters. These are amazing teams that we know very well, and we are adding [indiscernible] to our racing portfolio to drive growth. 
Formula One is one of the few truly global sports and is already seeing unprecedented growth in worldwide fame, including in North America and Asia. We believe the combination of EA SPORTS and Codemasters can take the game franchise to an even greater level. We are awaiting the results of Codemasters  shareholder vote on our offer, which we anticipate having tomorrow, February 3. 
With the strength of our EA SPORTS franchises and these announcements today, we are in a position to deliver the world's best sports games and content. We intend to leverage our capabilities in this space to grow to more sports and more experiences reaching larger audiences in more markets all over the world. These announcements today are just the beginning. For 230 million EA SPORTS players and viewers, we are providing a social network that enables them to experience more of the sport they love with their friends. We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in the EA SPORTS experiences over the next 5 years. 
The future of entertainment is interactive, and the future of sports will continue to blur the lines between live sports and immersive and engaging new experiences. EA SPORTS is at the center of this convergence. And in collaboration with our amazing league partners, we are prepared to accelerate the future of sports entertainment. 
In addition to EA SPORTS, we are driving growth through our portfolio of more than 20 top live services. I'll give 2 examples from our deep roster of wholly owned IP. We are at the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Apex Legends. And with 30% growth in new players year-over-year, its success is accelerating. The unique seasons of live service content delivered by our Tower Respawn team are expanding the Apex audience, bringing in more players with great storytelling and engaging in-game events. 
Competitive play in Apex Legends is also reaching and entertaining more viewers with recent events in November driving new viewership and watch time records. This is an outstanding live service business that continues to grow across multiple dimensions. Launching the game on Steam is bringing new PC players. We will launch on the Nintendo Switch on March 9, and we'll expand further with our Apex mobile game rolling out in FY '22. 
The Sims 4 has grown every year since launch. As we expand the experience more new and relevant content, we engage a diverse and growing audience spanning players of all ages and demographics. Life to date, more than 33 million people have now played the Sims 4 and daily, weekly and monthly average players in the game all reached all-time highs for the third quarter in December. Our Masters team just delivered a tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4, and we see continued growth for our Sims business in FY '22. 
We have the ability to bring games to every platform, and we are driving continuing expansion of our total addressable market. Mobile continues to be a key opportunity for us. Games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continue to be deeply engaging for players and very successful businesses, and we have plans to aggressively grow our mobile portfolio. We're also expanding our lead in subscriptions. The groundbreaking integration of our EA PLAY service with Microsoft Game Pass has accelerated our subscription business, with nearly 13 million players now active in our service across 4 platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam and our EA client. With more players valuing the subscription model and with our scale across platforms and content, we are building a strong growing business with recurring revenue. 
We also have new streaming players joining our network through Xbox cloud gaming with Game Pass Ultimate and other partners, and we are committed to advancing cloud as a meaningful part of the future of the gaming ecosystem. 
FY '21 has been a year of outstanding growth while working through the challenges of the ongoing pandemic. Our execution continues to be strong even with our employees working from home, and we expect that most will continue to do so through September. The creativity and innovation of our talented teams is enabling us to deliver more great experiences in our leading franchises and live services. We have a deep and robust pipeline of new content with more than 35 new games in various levels of incubation and development for the future. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more about our FY '22 plans in the months ahead, including our next Battlefield experience, which will mark a return to all-out military warfare. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation platforms to bring massive immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next edition of Battlefield takes all the disruption, player agency, [indiscernible] and weapon combat that the franchise is known for and elevate it to another level. The team is focused and the game is ahead of our internal milestones. We will reveal the game in the spring and deliver defined Battlefield experience for our players in the 2021 holiday season. 
Games helps fill a great need in people's lives through 2020. Our franchise is aware so many around the world are coming for connection, entertainment and inspiration. We're looking forward to delivering more great experiences for hundreds of millions of people engaging with us and driving continued growth in our business through Q4 and into FY '22. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of",984,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of $2.4 billion. We've built our live services for longevity. FIFA and Madden have both been around for decades. Measured over the last 10 fiscal years, the FIFA franchise has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 50% and Madden at nearly 60%. The Sims 4 is on track for its sixth consecutive year of growth in Apex Legends for second at the beginning of what we hope will be a similar long run for this title. [indiscernible] an amplify year that we expect Apex to deliver well over $500 million in net bookings this year compared to our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. 
The Apex team has really embraced the playfulness of the characters and gameplay. The team has focused on having more fun in the craft of building and experimenting with new modes in ways to explore the APEX universe and characters. This has been paying off with a compound average growth rate of 14% per season as measured from season 2. That's equivalent to an annual compounded annual growth rate of about 65%. 
With regards to the sports opportunity, in particular, we estimate the worldwide sports and video game software segment is about $7 billion on console and PC today. It's grown by about 13% annually since 2016. We're the leader in that segment and are now applying our full focus to the spectrum of sports opportunities from casual to core. 
The global gaming market for sports is presently about $4.3 billion in size and growing fast at about 24% a year. We're barely scratching the surface of this massive opportunity. But we have a lot of projects in flight, and you'll hear more about our activities here in [indiscernible]. 
Operationally, we're in working in challenging times, but we've been able to lean into the advantages that come with our scale to deliver games of quality with remarkably little impact on timing. 
This quarter, we launched FIFA 21, NHL 21, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. We also extended FIFA and Madden to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to Stadia and added our EA PLAY services to Microsoft Game Pass. We continued a packed schedule of live events for Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden and NHL. We launched Season 7 for Apex and launched Season 8 today. We launched the Snowy Escapes package for the Sims. 
The step function jump in digital sales prompted by COVID appeared resilient with digital representing 62% of units sold through in the quarter, up 13 percentage points from last year. Mobile showed its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth with outperformance across the board this quarter, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. We'll have much more to say about our mobile strategy later this year, and we continue to be excited about the games we currently have in play. 
Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, primarily driven by the phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $2.06 billion. The quarter was very close to our record for quarterly cash flow, which we delivered back in Q3 fiscal 2017 with the help of Battlefield 1. Needless to say, we're excited about the potential for the next battlefield in Q3 next fiscal year. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue was $5.6 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.447 billion and earnings per share of $2.54. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our recently announced 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. 
We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. 
We're raising our net bookings expectations for the year to be $6.075 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance. This is driven by continued strength in our [indiscernible] services, particularly FIFA and Apex Legends. It is $525 million above our expectations at the start of the year despite the changes we made to the product slate during the year. We expect this year to be 13% over prior year even with a lighter release slate versus the prior year and an FX headwind of about $55 million. 
For the fourth quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.317 billion, cost of revenue to be $302 million and operating expenses of $837 million. This results in a loss per share of $0.07 for the fourth quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the fourth quarter to be $1.375 billion, which is an increase of $75 million over our prior guidance. We've built a foundation for growth in fiscal 2022. We have successfully brought new people into our ecosystem. We're providing great content for people who want to spend more time there. We've been working hard on new titles and new platforms. We expect this to deliver significant organic growth in fiscal 2022. 
Formal guidance will follow in our Q4 call, but I can tell you now that the Battlefield team is doing an incredible job. They're way ahead of where they were in product -- or prior product cycles, on track for their earliest future complete and franchise history. Meanwhile, the live service teams for FIFA, Apex Legends, the Sims and Madden all continue to outdo themselves. And of course, we'll have other surprises that we'll reveal when the time is right. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew."

And then just the second one is at the point that you guys kind of came into the beginning of fiscal Q3, it was on the tail end of the summer. It felt like parts of the country had partially reopened before locking down again. So I just wonder what the experience you saw over the course of Q3 was in terms of had people churned out at the beginning, then came back into gaming as other entertainment options became more restricted?

So let me jump into that in the context of Star Wars. We won't be announcing new things here. But what I would say is if you look at our history with Star Wars, we've had a long and very profitable relationship. First, with Lucasart and then with -- or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney. We have generated a number of great franchises, Star Wars not to the older public, Galactic Heroes, Battlefront Jedi: Fallen Order and most recently, Squadrons. That represents over $3 billion life-to-date net bookings and 52 million games sold. And Galaxy of Heroes is a $1 billion franchise. 
As we've established the very strong part of that franchise, you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future. 
With respect to engagement more broadly, I think that we've seen strong engagement throughout the last year. Blake and I have both been relatively conservative, I think, as we look to the future at each moment in time, but we feel good about where engagement has been. And we feel we now feel more confident the increased engagement we've seen in our experiences is likely to continue on a go-forward basis.

But more on that to come in the month ahead, and we're excited to share more on that at the appropriate time. 
With respect to our college football game, again, this was kind of part of my past life leading EA SPORTS. It was a really strong game. It was a fan favorite game. It sold tens of millions of units over its life. And we expect that it will continue to be a really strong fan favorite game. It's measured by the amount of e-mails I get in my inbox each week requesting us to bring back this game. 
I think that we could look to the past as a factor for the future. But I'd also say that I think college football, as a fan, audience has grown dramatically since we launched the last game in 2013. I also think the nature of game play has changed dramatically as we think about the future of sports, and you heard us speak to the conversion of sports and entertainment more broadly. And so we're excited to bring that back in the years ahead."

And then secondly, on FIFA Mobile, can you expand a bit more on the current strategy in growing that title? I believe you mentioned there are 6 different FIFA games. Are they going to be similar with each other just being localized for each region? Or are they completely separate games?

And that's the reason we decided to put it out on Nintendo Switch. But we also know that Nintendo Switch is a global business, not just a Japanese business. We think the combination of Nintendo Switch Apex plus mobile Apex will be very powerful. We believe mobile Apex will be in soft launch sometime in the next 3 to 4 months and hopefully gets into the marketplace quickly. 
Obviously, it will take longer to get into the market in China because of some of the regulatory issues. But in the rest of the world, we don't see those issues happening. But we also want to make sure it is the exact product that we want. I think the team is very dedicated to making sure the product is the perfect product for a global market. 
But they've learned a lot from Japan. They've learned a lot from character development and so forth in that market, and we think that will continue to help us. 
And let's all remember, less than 2 years ago, no one knew this product existed. Today, it's over $1 billion. We think there is a huge upside to this product over time, and I just encourage people to keep focused on that because we don't have a mobile product today. We don't have a Switch product today. There are still other platforms around the world that we might go on.

On FIFA, I think the best way to think about this is soccer is the world's largest sport by a wide margin. Mobile is the world's largest gaming platform, also as it turns out, by a wide margin in terms of magnitude of players. What we know about soccer as we travel around the world and what we know about mobile, as we look at the growing player base, is that soccer means different things, different people in different markets. And certainly, as we look at the magnitude of players that come into the mobile ecosystem, they're often looking for different types of experiences with respect to subject matter that they love. 
And so as we look at our FIFA business, building off the strength of our licensing relationships on a global basis, we think there is an opportunity to deliver a number of different experiences across the mobile platform from different geographies and different player cohorts based on what they're looking for, and we think that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us."

Second question on the broad topic of social. It's a pretty broad question. I'll try and make it short. But I think the word social was mentioned in your prepared remarks multiple times. Surely, we all could agree that the convergence of what we call gaming and social is happening in front of our eyes Fortnite Roblox. Just wondered how you think about -- as you evolve your portfolio of games, what that means for your evolution? Where your biggest opportunities are to take advantage of that to me, clearly, the Sims is an obvious place that comes to mind.

One, I think we underperformed possible over the last number of years, and that's been very disappointing to us. With that said, we continue to have a really good relationship with the NBA and remain committed to basketball long term. And you should imagine that we are thinking through the best ways for us to use the strength of our business, the strength of our technology and the amazing creativity of our teams to deliver really cool, new, innovative experiences for basketball fans. 
With respect to social, in general, the short answer is yes. Part of what we have recognized now is that our players, particularly over the last year, have been using our games as ways to remain connected with their friends even while they are apart. And you may have heard me say this before, but social interaction is moving from physical to digital, more broadly for the Gen Z population. And the consumption of sport and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive to the Gen Z population, and we kind of sit at the very intersection of those 2 secular trends. 
And so what we've started to do is really build around our content to ensure that we are providing more social opportunities for our fans and the Madden Pro Bowl over the weekend was one such example of how we can take our game at the center of a social ecosystem and build around that for fans, both fans who play our games and fans to interact with plays of our games. 
When we think about our sports franchises, when we think about Apex, when we think about the Sims, when we think about mobile on a go-forward basis, we think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to build more into that and deliver on the social interaction our fans are asking for. And you should expect us to talk more about that in the future as we think about community, commentary, social interaction, competition, all wrapped in the data that our Gen Z fans are using on a day-to-day basis to play our games."

And I think that from the outside wall, there have been some blips in their delivery over the last couple of years, but that has come as a result of them pushing deeply into innovation and creativity, and we feel very, very confident about their future road map, and we've talked about games like Dragon Agent Mass Effect in their future. 
With respect to Casey and Mark leaving, again, both good friends of mine. We have tremendous respect for both of them. But this happens in the natural course of creative organizations from time to time. And we feel very, very good about the ongoing leadership of that studio and the many people who come to work every day to deliver great innovation and creativity.

And so we're encouraged by what that studio will continue to deliver. 
In terms of Star Wars, I don't think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games. And as I said before, we've had a long partnership with Disney, both before our exclusive period that gave us a great opportunity to really establish some very strong franchises like Battle Front, like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, like Jedi: Fallen Order, like Squadrons. You should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It's been very profitable, to this point, over $3 billion in net bookings, and we're excited by what we'll be able to do in the future. But you shouldn't read this as necessarily us building the less titles. I think what you should take from us more broadly as a company, we believe in our ability to execute and deliver great, high-quality, deeply engaging content for our fans across both our sports business, our wholly owned IP business and our licensed partnership business like the one we have with Star Wars, and we feel confident and comfortable that we're going to be able to deliver great games for the future."

And how quickly would you intend to ramp live services on the Codemasters titles? 
My second question for Sims to your guidance. So last year, with fiscal 3Q earnings, you suggested that fiscal '22 growth would accelerate with the next-gen consoles and Battlefield serving as the key drivers. Maybe fast forward to today, your comp will presumably be much higher than where you thought it would be, but you still have those 2 pieces in place, plus [indiscernible] and Codemasters, and you've talked about a number of initiatives with FIFA and Apex today. So given that, is accelerating growth in fiscal '22 remotely possible?"

I mean what we're saying is we believe that the trends that we see",590,"Yes. Let me -- Drew, let me start with the second question. We wouldn't come out and say that accelerating growth was possible, but we're confident of it -- if we weren't confident of it. I mean what we're saying is we believe that the trends that we see in this year's business will continue. We have Battlefield next year, and we haven't actually even put in place what we think Codemasters could deliver because the deal is not closed yet. And so we're clearly thinking and saying we see coming off of the year in which we started at $5.55 billion, we're now telling people we're close to $6.1 billion in revenue. And we're telling people we're going to grow again next year. I think you guys should take that as an incredible level of commitment and confidence on where the business is going, absent even additions from nonorganic growth because we spilled out, this is organic growth we're talking about. And so I would get people -- I'd be very focused on that. 
There is a lot of spin right now in the marketplace around the fact that we decided to capitalize part of the GILTI tax regimes, R&D expenses in our fourth quarter to try to get behind it because we had a strong year. And so the reason we have a fourth quarter that shows a GAAP -- not a non-GAAP, but a GAAP decline in EPS is purely getting ahead of what is going to be a tax cost for every company out there that gets hit by GILTI. And we're trying to be aggressive and stay in front of that. But the cash impact of that is minimal. And we think in a year in which we are already well above our EPS and our earnings, it was the exact right thing to do. 
And I'm not sure why everyone wants to spin on that, but I would dig in a little bit, ask the questions and make sure you understand what that really means. I know that's not the question you asked. But I want to make sure it's clear to everybody that that's exactly what's going on right now. 
Now Codemasters  on its own could be a nice addition to the company. We know that they have some incredible franchises. The F1 franchise is so nascent. It's a new franchise for them. We know if you're based in the U.S., there's very little F1 racing going on in the U.S. And yet we know that the owners of F1 would like to build an F1 business in the U.S. We know that there's still expansion around the globe. It is probably one of the best growth opportunities there is and the reason that we're willing to pay what we were willing to pay for it, on top of the fact that the Dirt franchise, the Grid franchise, all of their franchises are incredible games, but none of them have actually taken advantage of a large publishing organization and a marketing muscle that we're able to deliver, and we think that has growth to it, not to mention the talent that's in that organization that could continue to help our Need for Speed business or our real racing business. It could be very powerful. 
So we know it is not a FIFA-sized business, but we know there is incredible opportunity to own essentially all of the driving business there is. 
So with that passionate answer, I've forgotten what your other question was. So"

But as I think about this as an opportunity, I start with the fact that we have got to bring together all of the greatest racing talent in our industry or most of the great racing talent in our industry. 
When I think about taking that collection of talent and pointing them at Need for Speed, pointing them at Formula One, point them at Dirt and thinking about how all of that might happen with regular launches of those titles with really strong live services wrapped around them, which we don't yet see in the Codemasters games, all powered by the leverage of the marketing organization that we have behind us, I think the opportunity is really, really strong. 
And so you should imagine that as we think about this, Need for Speed, which is already one of the leading rating franchises that we launch every other year, we think there might be opportunities around growth of releases and certainly growth of that title. We think that F1 plus live service plus our marketing muscle is a profound opportunity. And we think that Grid and Dirt also represent great new additions to our portfolio. But the big win here is bringing together what we believe is going to be the greatest collection of racing talent in the industry. 
With respect to FIFA, all of these things are in play. You will have seen, and we talked about this even our existing FIFA mobile game has grown year-over-year. Our FIFA Mobile Asia game continues to expand and has grown year-over-year. We are working with in Japan on a Japanese-inspired game, folks on the Japanese market that we believe will have global appeal. [indiscernible] Jeff Karp has come into our mobile organization. We've consolidated that organization. We brought all of sports and all other mobile titles together, and we have identified sport and particularly soccer as a really, really big global opportunity. 
As a background Jeff at one time ran marketing for EA SPORTS many, many years ago. On leading EA, he ran a number of mobile companies and has come back and is having a tremendous impact on that business.

We'll have over 100 colleges, all of the logos and kids and stadiums and on-field pageantry that makes college football great. And we are very excited and believe that we can build a really compelling college football game with all of those components in partnership with schools across the country. And the response that we've had to the announcement kind of ratifies that excitement. And so you should hear more from us on that in the month ahead."

So what's really driving that increase? And should that carry over into next year as well?

One is we've continued to try to do everything possible to support our workforce in a work-from-home mode and COVID support. And so you can assume that some portion of those expenses are associated with that, and there may be expenses that would drift into next year. 
Second is we are having -- obviously, we're having  one of the best years we've ever had. And what does that mean for us? It means we want to take advantage of the strength in our organization and the ability to hire people, particularly when other companies are not able to do that. And we think this is a unique opportunity for us to go out and continue to try to grow great teams. 
I mean to give you a simple example. It's not like we have a group of people just sitting around doing nothing that are waiting to build a college football. We're going to need to grow a team to do that. We think it's the right thing to do. We, I think, manage the economics of our teams well. But we're going to continue to hire people, particularly in the time in which we've been able to prove to our employees and those people who see our employees that we are a great place to work. And so that's driving some of the uptick in expenses that you're seeing. 
And then I would just go back in history and look at, okay, how good were we at always forecasting OpEx? Are we that good at it? Probably not. 
So with that, I'll turn it to Andrew for your second question."

And we've seen creation and sharing on that platform, maybe not to the extent of a Minecraft or a roadblock certainly, But as we look at the MAXs team, that's certainly something that is front and center to how they think about that franchise. 
We're also thinking about this in the context of some of our new experiences, and we have an entire group inside the company right now focused on player agency and creation at a player level. And as we roll out those experience over time, you should expect that some of those will be kind of bound to a gain in the way that Minecraft is that Sims and Maxes would be a great example of that. And some of those will be platform level. Again, we have some great game development tools. And we think over time, there might be an opportunity to share those with our communities and allow them to create new content with those tools over time. It's certainly a developing area of our industry. It's something that Gen Z players are really gravitating towards. And when we think about developing a social network for Gen Z plays around each of our major franchises. We think about user-generated content as a very central strand of the DNA of those experiences in those communities."

27963,668608824,2188954,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We've delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter, and we are raisin",1907,"Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We've delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter, and we are raising guidance today for the remainder of FY '21.
After starting this fiscal year with guidance for $5.55 billion in net bookings, we're now expecting to achieve nearly $6.1 billion in net bookings for the full year. And we are projecting growth in our business to continue next fiscal year. We're delivering exceptional high-quality experiences across the unmatched breadth and depth of our portfolio. We are driving growth through our live services, and we are reaching new players by bringing our content and subscription to more platforms.
Drilling down on these growth drivers. EA SPORTS is at the core of the sports experience for hundreds of millions of fans. More and more people, especially younger Gen Z players, are now defining their sports fandom through the games they play like FIFA, Madden, NHL and UFC. In the past fiscal year, we've had more than 230 million people engaged with our EA SPORTS franchises and content. We delivered 6 new high-quality sports games in FY '21, including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21, on the new Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, ushering in a new generation of sports games.
FIFA continues to grow on every platform. We set a new record of nearly 6 million daily active players in FIFA Ultimate Team in December, and FUT matches have grown a staggering 177% year-over-year. FIFA Online 4 in Korea has had higher player acquisition in every quarter of this year compared to last year. And we now have nearly 21 million players in FIFA Mobile Asia.
We are driving growth across our EA SPORTS portfolio. Madden NFL has more players engaged in the franchise than ever before. NHL engagement is up 13% year-over-year. And since launch, UFC 4 has consistently had 20% more daily players than our previous game. 
EA SPORTS is at the center of innovation, both in our games as well as how fans are connecting through our games to their friends and to the sports they love. For example, in a year where an in-person Pro Bowl event was not possible, we worked with our NFL partners to create the first-ever virtual Pro Bowl in Madden NFL 21. This was a groundbreaking experience for fans, where playing Madden actually helped to select 2 Pro Bowl players. 
The Pro Bowl itself then took place in Madden NFL 21 with Deshaun Watson and Kyler Murray leading teams of NFL stars in highly entertaining broadcast that aired on Twitch, the NFL Network and NFL social channels last Sunday. Now the Super Bowl is just a few days away, and we're preparing new content in and outside non-NFL for the increasing number of players engaging with our franchise around the NFL's championship game. Events like this year's Pro Bowl demonstrate how real-world sports experiences are evolving to become interactive, and you can expect to see us continue to lead here. 
Our fans are telling us that they want more of what EA SPORTS can deliver. They're playing more of our games than ever before. They're spending more time with our content. And they're connecting with each other, the players and teams and sports they love through our experiences.
We are now set to build on our leadership position with an aggressive expansion planned for EA SPORTS. We have important announcements we are making today and more that we expect to make in the weeks ahead that will lead to more great games and content for fans and significant new growth to our company. 
We have a major global expansion of our soccer business underway. As the scale of our EA SPORTS FIFA player audience expands, including a growing Gen Z population, we will offer more great content on more platforms with our long-standing partners across all the top leagues and teams in the sport. We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories, including Russia, Poland and Turkey, with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with 6 new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres.
EA SPORTS is the premier partner for football organizations, leagues and teams around the world. And today, we are announcing that EA SPORTS FIFA will continue to be the exclusive home of UEFA Champions League football. As part of our renewed partnership with UEFA, we'll also be launching new EA SPORTS competitions, and we'll have even more news in this space in the months ahead.
We're bringing new types of experiences to market that will expand the genre. In partnership with KLab, we are developing a groundbreaking new mobile experience inspired by the Japanese market, which we believe will have global appeal.
We're thrilled to announce today that EA SPORTS is returning to college football. So many fans have been asking us to please bring back college football video games. Their passion for this top-selling sports franchise has never wavered. We love college football as well, and today, we're very excited to say, yes, we are coming back. We have started work on an all-new next-gen experience, working closely with our exclusive licensing partners at CLC to include the universities, logos, venues and gameday traditions that fans know and love in college football. 
We will grow the EA SPORTS portfolio to include experiences in more sports for more fans around the world. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll make more announcements about our expansion in a different sport, including at least one new experience that will launch next fiscal year.
We're also incredibly excited to build a racing powerhouse with our proposed acquisition of Codemasters. These are amazing teams that we know very well, and we are adding significantly to our racing portfolio to drive growth. FORMULA ONE is one of the few truly global sports and is already seeing unprecedented growth in worldwide fandom, including in North America and Asia. We believe the combination of EA SPORTS and Codemasters can take the game franchise to an even greater level. We are awaiting the results of Codemasters shareholder vote on our offer, which we anticipate having tomorrow, February 3.
With the strength of our EA SPORTS franchises and these announcements today, we are in a position to deliver the world's best sports games and content. We intend to leverage our capabilities in this space to grow to more sports and more experiences, reaching larger audiences in more markets all over the world. These announcements today are just the beginning. For 230 million EA SPORTS players and viewers, we are providing a social network that enables them to experience more of the sport they love with their friends. We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in EA SPORTS experiences over the next 5 years.
The future of entertainment is interactive, and the future of sports will continue to blur the lines between live sports and immersive and engaging new experiences. EA SPORTS is at the center of this convergence. And in collaboration with our amazing league partners, we are prepared to accelerate the future of sports entertainment.
In addition to EA SPORTS, we are driving growth through our portfolio of more than 20 top live services. I'll give 2 examples from our deep roster of wholly owned IP. We are at the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Apex Legends. And with 30% growth in new players year-over-year, its success is accelerating. The unique seasons of live service content delivered by our talented Respawn team are expanding the Apex audience, bringing in more players with great storytelling and engaging in-game events.
Competitive play in Apex Legends is also reaching and entertaining more viewers with recent events in November driving new viewership and watch time records. This is an outstanding live service business that continues to grow across multiple dimensions. Launching the game on Steam is bringing new PC players. We will launch on the Nintendo Switch on March 9, and we'll expand further with our Apex mobile game rolling out in FY '22.
The Sims 4 has grown every year since launch. As we expand the experience, more new and relevant content, we engage a diverse and growing audience spanning players of all ages and demographics. Life to date, more than 33 million people have now played The Sims 4. And daily, weekly and monthly average players in the game all reached all-time highs for the third quarter in December. Our Maxis just delivered a tenth expansion pack for The Sims 4, and we see continued growth for our Sims business in FY '22.
We have the ability to bring games to every platform, and we are driving continuing expansion of our total addressable market. Mobile continues to be a key opportunity for us. Games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continue to be deeply engaging for players and very successful businesses, and we have plans to aggressively grow our mobile portfolio.
We're also expanding our lead in subscriptions. The groundbreaking integration of our EA PLAY service with Microsoft Game Pass has accelerated our subscription business, with nearly 13 million players now active in our service across 4 platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam and our EA client. With more players valuing the subscription model and with our scale across platforms and content, we are building a strong growing business with recurrent revenue. 
We also have new streaming players joining our network through Xbox cloud gaming, with Game Pass Ultimate and other partners. And we are committed to advancing cloud as a meaningful part of the future of the gaming ecosystem.
FY '21 has been a year of outstanding growth while working through the challenges of the ongoing pandemic. Our execution continues to be strong even with our employees working from home, and we expect that most will continue to do so through September. The creativity and innovation of our talented teams is enabling us to deliver more great experiences in our leading franchises and live services. We have a deep and robust pipeline of new content with more than 35 new games in various levels of incubation and development for the future. 
We're looking forward to sharing a lot more about our FY '22 plans in the months ahead, including our next Battlefield experience, which will mark a return to all-out military warfare. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation platforms to bring massive immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next edition of Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for and elevate it to another level. The team is focused and the game is ahead of our internal milestones. We will reveal the game in the spring and deliver defined Battlefield experience for our players in the 2021 holiday season.
Games helped fill a great need in people's lives through 2020. Our franchise is aware so many around the world are coming for connection, entertainment and inspiration. We're looking forward to delivering more great experiences for hundreds of millions of people engaging with us and driving continued growth in our business through Q4 and into FY '22.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,668608824,2188954,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2021",2021-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of",988,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of $2.4 billion. 
We've built our live services for longevity. FIFA and Madden have both been around for decades. Measured over the last 10 fiscal years, the FIFA franchise has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 50% and Madden at nearly 60%. 
The Sims 4 is on track for its sixth consecutive year of growth and Apex Legends for its second at the beginning of what we hope will be a similar long run for this title. I'd reiterate and amplify here that we expect Apex to deliver well over $500 million in net bookings this year compared to our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. 
The Apex team has really embraced the playfulness of the characters and gameplay. The team has focused on having more fun in the craft of building and experimenting with new modes and ways to explore the APEX universe and characters. This has been paying off with a compound average growth rate of 14% per season as measured from season 2. That's equivalent to an annual -- compounded annual growth rate of about 65%.
With regards to the sports opportunity, in particular, we estimate the worldwide sports video game software segment is about $7 billion on console and PC today. It's grown by about 13% annually since 2016. We're the leader in that segment and are now applying our full focus to the spectrum of sports opportunities from casual to core.
The global gaming market for sports is presently about $4.3 billion in size and growing fast at about 24% a year. We're barely scratching the surface of this massive opportunity. But we have a lot of projects in flight, and you'll hear more about our activities here in the year to come.
Operationally, we're in working in challenging times, but we've been able to lean into the advantages that come with our scale to deliver games of quality with remarkably little impact on timing. This quarter, we launched FIFA 21, NHL 21, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. We also extended FIFA and Madden to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to Stadia and added our EA PLAY services to Microsoft Game Pass. We continued a packed schedule of live events for Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden and NHL. We launched Season 7 for Apex and launched Season 8 today. We launched the Snowy Escapes package for The Sims.
The step function jump in digital sales prompted by COVID appeared resilient with digital representing 62% of units sold through in the quarter, up 13 percentage points from last year. Mobile showed its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth with outperformance across the board this quarter, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. We'll have much more to say about our mobile strategy later this year, and we continue to be excited about the games we currently have in play.
Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, primarily driven by the phasing of marketing investments. We hit a new record in trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $2.06 billion. The quarter was very close to our record for quarterly cash flow, which we delivered back in Q3 fiscal 2017 with the help of Battlefield 1. Needless to say, we're excited about the potential for the next Battlefield in Q3 next fiscal year. 
Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue was $5.6 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.447 billion and earnings per share of $2.54. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our recently announced 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.
We're raising our net bookings expectations for the year to be $6.075 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance. This is driven by continued strength in our live services, particularly FIFA and Apex Legends. It is $525 million above our expectations at the start of the year despite the changes we made to the product slate during the year. We expect this year to be 13% over prior year, even with a lighter release slate versus the prior year and an FX headwind of about $55 million.
For the fourth quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.317 billion, cost of revenue to be $302 million and operating expenses of $837 million. This results in a loss per share of $0.07 for the fourth quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the fourth quarter to be $1.375 billion, which is an increase of $75 million over our prior guidance. 
We've built a foundation for growth in fiscal 2022. We have successfully brought new people into our ecosystem. We're providing great content for people who want to spend more time there. We've been working hard on new titles and new platforms. We expect this to deliver significant organic growth in fiscal 2022.
Formal guidance will follow in our Q4 call, but I can tell you now that the Battlefield team is doing an incredible job. They're way ahead of where they were in product -- prior product cycles, on track for their earliest feature complete in franchise history. Meanwhile, the live service teams for FIFA, Apex Legends, The Sims and Madden all continue to outdo themselves. And of course, we'll have other surprises that we'll reveal when the time is right.
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew."

And then just the second one is at the point that you guys kind of came into the beginning of fiscal Q3, it was on the tail end of the summer.

But what I would say is if you look at our history with Star Wars, we've had a long and very profitable relationship, first, with Lucasart and then with -- or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney. We have generated a number of great franchises, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront, Jedi: Fallen Order and most recently, Squadrons. That represents over $3 billion life-to-date net bookings and 52 million games sold. And Galaxy of Heroes is a $1 billion franchise.  
As we've established the very strong part of that franchise, you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future.
With respect to engagement more broadly, I think that we've seen strong engagement throughout the last year. Blake and I have both been relatively conservative, I think, as we look to the future at each moment in time, but we feel good about where engagement has been. And we feel -- we now feel more confident that the increased engagement we've seen in our experiences is likely to continue on a go-forward basis.

But more on that to come in the month ahead, and we're excited to share more on that at the appropriate time.
With respect to our college football game, again, this was kind of part of my past life leading EA SPORTS. It was a really strong game. It was a fan favorite game. It sold tens of millions of units over its life. And we expect that it will continue to be a really strong fan favorite game. It's measured by the amount of e-mails I get in my inbox each week requesting us to bring back this game.
I think that we could look to the past as a factor for the future. But I'd also say that I think college football, as a fan, audience has grown dramatically since we launched the last game in 2013. I also think the nature of gameplay has changed dramatically as we think about the future of sports, and you heard us speak to the conversion of sports and entertainment more broadly. And so we're excited to bring that back in the years ahead."

And that's the reason we decided to put it out on Nintendo Switch. But we also know that Nintendo Switch is a global business, not just a Japanese business. 
We think the combination of Nintendo Switch, Apex plus mobile Apex will be very powerful. We believe mobile Apex will be in soft launch sometime in the next 3 to 4 months and hopefully gets into the marketplace quickly. 
Obviously, it will take longer to get into the market in China because of some of the regulatory issues. But in the rest of the world, we don't see those issues happening. But we also want to make sure it is the exact product that we want. I think the team is very dedicated to making sure the product is the perfect product for a global market. But they've learned a lot from Japan. They've learned a lot from character development and so forth in that market, and we think that will continue to help us.
And let's all remember, less than 2 years ago, no one knew this product existed. Today, it's over $1 billion. We think there is a huge upside to this product over time, and I just encourage people to keep focused on that because we don't have a mobile product today. We don't have a Switch product today. There are still other platforms around the world that we might go on.

And so as we look at our FIFA business, building off the strength of our licensing relationships on a global basis, we think there is an opportunity to deliver a number of different experiences across the mobile platform from different geographies and different player cohorts based on what they're looking for.

Second question on the broad topic of social. It's a pretty broad question. I'll try and make it short. But I think the word social was mentioned in your prepared remarks multiple times. Surely, we all could agree that the convergence of what we call gaming and social is happening in front of our eyes, Fortnite, Roblox. Just wondered how you think about, as you evolve your portfolio of games, what that means for your evolution, where your biggest opportunities are to take advantage of that. To me, clearly, The Sims is an obvious place that comes to mind. Are you proactively doing anything to be more sort of aggressive in pursuing that aspect of gaming?"

One, I think we underperformed on basketball over the last number of years, and that's been very disappointing to us. With that said, we continue to have a really good relationship with the NBA and remain committed to basketball long term. And you should imagine that we are thinking through the best ways for us to use the strength of our business, the strength of our technology and the amazing creativity of our teams to deliver really cool, new, innovative experiences for basketball fans.
With respect to social, in general, the short answer is yes. Part of what we have recognized now is that our players, particularly over the last year, have been using our games as ways to remain connected with their friends even while they are apart. And you may have heard me say this before, but social interaction is moving from physical to digital more broadly for the Gen Z population. And the consumption of sport and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive for the Gen Z population, and we kind of sit at the very intersection of those 2 secular trends. 
And so what we've started to do is really build around our content to ensure that we are providing more social opportunities for our fans and the Madden, Pro Bowl over the weekend was one such example of how we can take our game at the center of a social ecosystem and build around that for fans, both fans who play our games and fans who interact with plays of our games.
When we think about our sports franchises, when we think about Apex, when we think about The Sims, when we think about mobile on a go-forward basis, we think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to build more into that and deliver on the social interaction our fans are asking for. And you should expect us to talk more about that in the future as we think about community, commentary, social interaction, competition, all wrapped in the data that our Gen Z fans are using on a day-to-day basis to play our games."

We look forward to sharing more about what's coming from BioWare in the near future. And you will have just seen our Mass Effect trilogy Legendary Edition announced, and that has been extraordinarily well received by BioWare fans. And so we're encouraged by what that studio will continue to deliver. 
In terms of Star Wars, I don't think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games. And as I said before, we've had a long partnership with Disney, both before our exclusive period that gave us a great opportunity to really establish some very strong franchises like Battlefront, like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, like Jedi: Fallen Order, like Squadrons. You should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It's been very profitable, to this point, over $3 billion in net bookings, and we're excited by what we'll be able to do in the future. 
But you shouldn't read this as necessarily us building the less titles. I think what you should take from us more broadly as a company is that we believe in our ability to execute and deliver great, high-quality, deeply engaging content for our fans across both our sports business, our wholly owned IP business and our licensed partnership business like the one we have with Star Wars.

My second question for Sims to your guidance. So last year, with fiscal 3Q earnings, you suggested that fiscal '22 growth would accelerate with the next-gen consoles and Battlefield serving as the key drivers. Maybe fast forward to today, your comp will presumably be much higher than where you thought it would be. But you still have those 2 pieces in place, plus you're adding Codemasters, and you've talked about a number of initiatives with FIFA and Apex today. So given that, is accelerating growth in fiscal '22 remotely possible?"

I mean what we're saying is we believe that the trends that we see",598,"Yes. Let me -- Drew, let me start with the second question. We wouldn't come out and say that accelerating growth was possible, but we're confident of it -- if we weren't confident of it. I mean what we're saying is we believe that the trends that we see in this year's business will continue. We have Battlefield next year, and we haven't actually even put in place what we think Codex -- or Codemasters could deliver because the deal is not closed yet. 
And so we're clearly thinking and saying we see -- coming off of the year in which we started at $5.55 billion, we're now telling people we're close to $6.1 billion in revenue. And we're telling people we're going to grow again next year. I think you guys should take that as an incredible level of commitment and confidence on where the business is going, absent even additions from nonorganic growth because we spilled out, this is organic growth we're talking about. And so I would get people -- I'd be very focused on that. 
There is a lot of spin right now in the marketplace around the fact that we decided to capitalize part of the GILTI tax regimes, R&D expenses in our fourth quarter to try to get behind it because we had a strong year. And so the reason we have a fourth quarter that shows a GAAP -- not a non-GAAP, but a GAAP decline in EPS is purely getting ahead of what is going to be a tax cost for every company out there that gets hit by GILTI. And we're trying to be aggressive and stay in front of that. But the cash impact of that is minimal. And we think in a year in which we are already well above our EPS and our earnings, it was the exact right thing to do. 
And I'm not sure why everyone wants to spin on that, but I would dig in a little bit, ask the questions and make sure you understand what that really means. I know that's not the question you asked. But I want to make sure it's clear to everybody that that's exactly what's going on right now. 
Now Codex (sic) [ Codemasters ] on its own could be a nice addition to the company. We know that they have some incredible franchises. The F1 franchise is so nascent. It's a new franchise for them. We know if you're based in the U.S., there's very little F1 racing going on in the U.S. And yet we know that the owners of F1 would like to build an F1 business in the U.S. 
We know that there's still expansion around the globe. It is probably one of the best growth opportunities there is and the reason that we're willing to pay what we were willing to pay for it, on top of the fact that the DiRT franchise, the GRID franchise, all of their franchises are incredible games, but none of them have actually taken advantage of a large publishing organization and a marketing muscle that we're able to deliver. And we think that has growth to it, not to mention the talent that's in that organization that could continue to help our Need for Speed business or our Real Racing business. It could be very powerful. 
So we know it is not a FIFA-sized business, but we know there is incredible opportunity to own essentially all of the driving business there is. So with that passionate answer, I've forgotten what your other question was. So..."

So let me -- on Codemasters, it's still early -- too early for us to kind of be able to outline all of that. Again, the deal hasn't closed yet. But as I think about this as an opportunity, I start with the fact that we will be able to bring together all of the greatest racing talent in our industry or most of the great racing talent in our industry. 
When I think about taking that collection of talent and pointing them at Need for Speed, pointing them at FORMULA ONE, pointing them at GRID, pointing them at DiRT and thinking about how all of that might happen with regular launches of those titles with really strong live services wrapped around them, which we don't yet see in the Codemasters games, all powered by the leverage of the marketing organization that we have behind us, I think the opportunity is really, really strong. 
And so you should imagine that as we think about this, Need for Speed, which is already one of the leading racing franchises that we launch every other year, we think there might be opportunities around growth of releases and certainly growth of that title. We think that F1 plus live service plus our marketing muscle is a profound opportunity. And we think that GRID and DiRT also represent great new additions to our portfolio. But the big win here is bringing together what we believe is going to be the greatest collection of racing talent in the industry. 
With respect to FIFA, all of these things are in play. You will have seen, and we talked about this, even our existing FIFA Mobile game has grown year-over-year. Our FIFA Mobile Asia game continues to expand and has grown year-over-year. We are working with KLab in Japan on a Japanese-inspired game, folks on the Japanese market that we believe will have global appeal. But Jeff Karp has come into our mobile organization. We've consolidated that organization. We brought all of sports and all other mobile titles together, and we have identified sport and particularly soccer as a really, really big global opportunity. 
As a background, Jeff at one time ran marketing for EA SPORTS many, many years ago. On leaving EA, he ran a number of mobile companies and has come back and is having a tremendous impact on that business. And so no more announcements specifically today, but you should expect over the next year or 2 that we're going to roll out growth in this business."

With respect to Apex, no announcements here. I would just come back to Respawn are amazingly creative as a studio. They've built unbelievable games both in the content of Titanfall Apex and more recently, Jedi: Fallen Order. As we continue to expand that -- they're on their eighth -- they've just launched their eighth season. Every season adds new characters and new gameplay and at some point, new maps. You should imagine that, that team is thinking about how to further expand that universe over time, and we'll be excited to share more about that in the future."

One is we've continued to try to do everything possible to support our workforce in a work-from-home mode and COVID support. And so you can assume that some portion of those expenses are associated with that and maybe expenses that would drift into next year. 
Second is we are having -- obviously, we're having  one of the best years we've ever had. And what does that mean for us? It means we want to take advantage of the strength in our organization and the ability to hire people, particularly when other companies are not able to do that. And we think this is a unique opportunity for us to go out and continue to try to grow great teams. 
I mean to give you a simple example. It's not like we have a group of people just sitting around doing nothing that are waiting to build college football. We're going to need to grow a team to do that. We think it's the right thing to do. We, I think, manage the economics of our teams well. But we're going to continue to hire people, particularly in a time in which we've been able to prove to our employees and those people who see our employees that we are a great place to work. And so that's driving some of the uptick in expenses that you're seeing. 
And then I would just go back in history and look at, okay, how good were we at always forecasting OpEx? Are we that good at it? Probably not. 
So with that, I'll turn it to Andrew for your second question."

And as we roll out those experience over time, you should expect that some of those will be kind of bound to a gain in the way that Minecraft is that -- Sims and Maxis would be a great example of that. And some of those will be platform level. 
Again, we have some great game development tools, and we think over time, there might be an opportunity to share those with our communities and allow them to create new content with those tools over time. It's certainly a developing area of our industry. It's something that Gen Z players are really gravitating towards.

I want to start today by saying welcome to our newest teammates from Codemasters, Glu Mobile and Metalhead Software. We're very excited to have added these incredibly talented teams to the EA family, and we're looking forward to creating some amazing new experiences together. 
FY '21 was a record year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our games continues to expand worldwide, leading industry transformation and fueling demand from a new generation of players that will continue for years to come. We delivered 13 new games in FY '21 and welcomed more than 42 million new players to our network of more than 500 million unique accounts. The tremendous engagement across our leading live services is a powerful demonstration our players are coming together and forming social networks through our experiences. 
We drove net bookings growth of more than $600 million above our original guidance for the fiscal year and achieved bottom line results significantly ahead of our expectations. Our teams continue to deliver for our players despite the challenges of the pandemic, and our execution of long-term strategies to create exceptional high-quality experiences, drive growth through our leading live services and expand our reach to more players are continuing to build strength in our business. 
As we look forward to FY '22, we are accelerating, powered by organic growth in our existing business, development of new businesses and layering growth from recent acquisitions. We're forecasting growth in FY '22. Our net bookings guidance reflects 18% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion. This includes organic growth in our core business and the addition of Glu, Codemasters and Metalhead acquisitions. From this position of strength, we are also investing in the future of our business, and we expect to continue to grow underlying profitability. 
I want to spend time today on 3 primary growth drivers for us in FY '22, expanding the EA SPORTS business, growing our Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises and our mobile growth strategy. We have a foundational strategy for growing these blockbuster brands that we are applying here, best-in-class premium experiences, deeply engaging live services that create social networks and our games and expansion of more platforms, new business models and new geographies. 
The model is how we've got FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL and The Sims into some of the most successful global live service businesses in the industry, and we are applying it as a blueprint across our franchises. As the undisputed leader in sports games, EA SPORTS is moving from strength and strength as we grow our current business and include more sports and reach new audiences. In FY '21, our EA SPORTS games brought players together at record levels. Our EA SPORTS FIFA experiences continue to engage more than 100 million players worldwide. 
More than 20 million players played FIFA Ultimate Team in the last year, and FIFA Ultimate Team matches were up at an incredible 180%. Madden NFL had its biggest year ever and games across our EA SPORTS portfolio continue to acquire more players than ever before. We'll now build on that strength with a massive year of innovation and expansion. All of our new EA SPORTS games in FY '22 are designed for next-gen console platforms including FIFA, Madden, NHL and EA SPORTS PGA Tour, our return to golf that is set for Q4 of this year. 
We're very excited by the opportunity to deliver for baseball fans around the world with the addition of Super Mega Baseball from Metalhead Software and MLB Baseball on mobile from the [indiscernible] EA SPORTS is also publishing the highest-rated sports franchise in a world with F1 2021, our first title from our recently completed Codemasters acquisition. And with the combined expertise of the Glu and EA teams, focused on engaging more sports fans, we plan to grow our sports mobile business by over 50% this year. 
We continue to see the consumption of sports move from linear to interactive, representing a major growth opportunity for us, spanning more sports and more platforms, especially mobile. From premium experiences to live services to mobile, EA SPORTS is in an unparalleled position to achieve more players with new ways to play, watch and connect. With Apex Legends and Battlefield, we have 2 leading franchises in that category. We are positioned for continued growth in FY '22 through new launches, expansion of mobile and preparing for the addition of new business models that will expand our total addressable audience. 
Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year and we are forecasting continued growth. Season 8 saw well over 12 million weekly active users, the highest levels we've seen since Season 1 in 2019. We're also seeing explosive growth for Apex in Asia, especially in Japan, where it has grown significantly in the last 3 quarters. 
As Respawn continues to deliver more new content and evolve the main game this year, we are also beginning regional beta testing of Apex Legends Mobile. This is a new experience designed specifically for touchscreens which we expect to launch worldwide later this fiscal year. Apex Legends continues to have tremendous momentum and is growing in every dimension. We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY '22, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. 
We are realizing the next phase of growth in our vision for Battlefield with 2 new experiences launching in FY '22. Three world-class studios, Die Stockholm, Criterion and [indiscernible] and our technology team in Gothenburg now form our largest ever battlefield development team. They are working in lockstep to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for Battlefield fans. 
The game has everything fans love about Battlefield: epic scale, all-out warfare, unexpected moments and game-changing destruction. And it takes it all to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and PCs. We're excited to review the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout this summer. We also have a Battlefield for mobile platforms in development and industrial toys in close partnership with Dice. Built from the ground up for mobile, the game is going into early testing now, and we're looking forward to players around the world getting a hand on this innovative Battlefield experience later in FY '22. 
As I mentioned before, our strategy is to grow Battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Apex: best-in-class gameplay, deeply engaging live service, a new mobile experience and more ways to play that we'll introduce to reach more players all over the world. 
Throughout FY '22, we will continue transforming mobile into a growth center for our business. With the recent reorganization and hiring of new leadership and talent into our EA Mobile teams, we are in a position to maximize our leaders leading mobile live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Sims Real Racing by growing player acquisition, deepening engagement and player investment and driving new opportunities in non-Western markets. 
We'll grow in sports model with innovation in our leading franchises, including FIFA, Madden and UFC as well as the addition of MLB Touch Sports Baseball to our mobile sports portfolio. We expect our 2 biggest chute of franchises to launch on mobile for the first time in FY '22, which is another demonstration of our multi-platform strategy for leading global franchises. With the addition of Glu late into our EA Mobile growth plans, we expect to more than double our Mobile business to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next 3 years. 
We have a year of strong growth ahead in FY '22, and we see many more opportunities as we continue to lead in the expansion and transformation of the industry. We have a very clear long-term growth strategy for our biggest blockbuster franchises. This is the foundation of our business, and you're seeing us grow all major platforms and business models. We're thrilled to have the team from Codemasters, Glu and Metalhead join the Electronic Arts [indiscernible] and together, we expect to develop many games and experiences that will delight our growing player base and be catalysts for growth in the years to come. 
We have a deep pipeline of new content, including new franchises and new IP, deeper focus on mobile games and experiences that will lean into user-generated content. We're also continuing to invest in opportunities where we have differentiated ability to reach and engage more players, including our growing subscription service and our esports content and competitions that will expand in scope this year. 
The 3 growth drivers that I've focused on today, expanding our EA SPORTS portfolio, growing our blockbuster shooter franchises and the transformation of our Mobile business provide clear growth and significant upside for Electronic Arts in FY '22 and beyond. We're excited to bring some amazing new games and content to our players and viewers around the world this year. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily and extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion, which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Ap",984,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily and extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion, which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Apex's phenomenal engagement stats. As a result of this engagement, Apex delivered its largest net bookings quarter on record. It also delivered the best day, the best 24-hour period, the best week, the best month and best in game embed. 
We suggested it would deliver over $1 billion in life-to-date net bookings by the end of the quarter. It actually passed that milestone with half of the quarter to go. Apex Legends delivered over $600 million for the year, well above our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. Importantly, Apex Legends steadily grew through the year. While Apex surely benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind, the upwards trajectory is driven by the game teams and the content they are delivering. That is the strength -- that is, this strength is structural, to the point Season 8 was the first season built by a new content team we put together in Vancouver, proving our ability to scale resources on our fastest-growing franchise. 
Our 2 major shooter franchises, Apex Legends and Battlefield and our ongoing strength in the Ultimate Team provides a tremendous foundation for growth in FY '22. The addition of Glu and Codemasters accelerates this to 18% revenue growth year-on-year. 
I'll go through the details of our guidance in a moment. First though, I thought I'd start with a quick look at what we achieved in fiscal 2021. We closed out the year with $5.63 billion in net revenue. We delivered net bookings of $6.19 billion, the highest in our history and about $640 million above our original expectations. Underlying profit was also an all-time record, as was full year operating cash flow of $1.93 billion. 
Of that $6.19 billion in net bookings, $4.6 billion was live services. There couldn't be a more dramatic illustration of the way the business has evolved, with our focus on engagement and ongoing entertainment now generating 3/4 of our net bookings. To give some perspective, that $4.6 billion is equivalent to the sale of around 130 million copies of console games. Digital represents 62% of our full game units sold in fiscal 2021 for consoles, up 13 percentage points from last year. 
Turning to Q4 specifically. The beat was driven by live services, primarily Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. Mobile also beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and SimCity Buildit. Operating expenses came in slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by acquisition-related expenses. 
Now turning to guidance. We expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.8 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.828 billion and earnings per share of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We expect operating cash flows of $1.75 billion and capital expenditures to be around $250 million, which would deliver free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. 
Cash flow is down year-on-year, primarily due to tax integration costs associated with the acquisitions. The level of these costs reflect the strength of the IP Glu and Codemasters have developed and bring to EA. CapEx is up temporarily with office build-outs in Bucharest, Los Angeles, Orlando and the United Kingdom. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. 
We expect fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $7.3 billion, up about 18% over fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022 and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year. In sports, we expect FIFA and Madden to be strong and we're launching a new PGA Tour golf game. F1 2021, developed by Codemasters, and which now sits under the EA SPORTS banner as well, will launch on July 16. 
And of course, rounding out the year for our shooter franchises is the launch of Battlefield in the holiday season. Because this is the first time we're forecasting Glu and Codemasters, we took a very conservative posture on net bookings from those businesses. In addition, we're not yet modeling any synergies from the 2 acquisitions. For fiscal 2022, we've assumed simple addition of their existing businesses into EA. Revenue and synergies will come further out as we [indiscernible] with Glu Mobile expertise to build out a suite of new casual mobile games, leverage our sports know-how with Codemasters' F1 franchise and others and implement a holistic strategy for racing games. 
Meanwhile, OpEx this year will be impacted by some onetime costs associated with the acquisitions. We're also leaning heavily into our biggest franchises, with increased R&D investments and marketing ahead of key launches from Battlefield and Apex Mobile. We expect these near-term investments to pay off in years to come. For the quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.475 billion, cost of revenue to be $287 million and operating expenses of $955 million. This results in an earnings per share of $0.24 for the first quarter. 
We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.25 billion. We expect Apex Legends' momentum will carry through to fiscal 2022. [indiscernible] of the game already, we believe our financial model of Battlefield may be conservative. And we're looking forward to player reaction when we reveal this game next month. 
In addition, we're very excited for the franchise as a whole as we add new platforms and business models. We expect strong organic growth this year, growth that is further accelerated by the addition of talented teams at Codemasters and Glu and Metalhead. It is an exciting time for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand it back to Andrew."

As we wrap up our remarks here, I want to share our heartfelt congratulations to Respawn Entertainment. The team achieved another amazing milestone last month when they received the gaming industry's first Academy Award for the COVID documentary short subject, Colette, which was released within the Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond VR experience. Congratulations to Vince, Dusty, Peter and the entire team. It is a truly outstanding achievement and such an incredible recognition of the creativity and passion for groundbreaking work that all of our teams put into our games. 
Games will begin -- are bringing joy to more players around the world than ever before, and our experiences are bringing hundreds of millions of players together. Our business has never been stronger. We have clear growth drivers accelerating our trajectory in FY '22, and our acquisitions are new catalysts for growth. 
As we continue building blockbuster trends with best-in-class live services that reach and connect players on more platforms and in more geographies around the world, we see significant upside for Electronic Arts this year and in the years to come. Thank you to our teams for their incredible work delivering for our clients every day. Now Blake and I are here for your questions."

Clearly, Apex has driven a huge change in that business. It's up dramatically year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone year-over-year, it's up 145%. And the way we've done that, as you know, is continue to add amazing content, amazing characters, amazing things for people to play, and it's engaging more and more people all the time. 
While COVID, as horrible as it has been, brought a lot of people into gaming. And what we've done is try to do our best to bring more and more people into social networks around the games they love, be it sports, be it a shooter game, be it The Sims. And that's what we've been able to leverage over time, and those people stay in those social networks because they enjoy the game and enjoy the people they're playing with. 
And so we see, across all of our live services, Ultimate Team, Apex, The Sims, all of our mobile games that has helped us get the confidence that we could give a guidance that we just provided for next year. And I think you're going to continue to see that as a huge part of our business. It's going to be a huge part of the industry's business, as we've already seen, but it will continue on for us, and we'll continue to add to that with new content, new ways to play, new opportunities for people to deeply get connected with other people that like what they like to do."

As you heard in the prepared remarks and you've heard me talk about before, over the last year, we really reorganized our mobile group. We brought in new leadership both at the very top of the organization and throughout the organization who really bring great mobile expertise and experience and knowledge and know-how and, of course, bringing in Codemasters -- bringing in Glu Mobile to that group puts us in a really, really strong position for an increased focus on mobile where we see tremendous growth opportunity. 
Across the rest of our studio structure, I also feel really, really good about our leadership and all of our creative talent there. Again, we've brought in Codemasters, which are some of the leading racing developers in the world, and you'll see more from us around our holistic braking strategy. But F1 is already looking really, really strong for this year. 
And we've been recruiting, over the last 12 to 18 months, some amazing industry-leading talent. Some of those have been announced, some announced yet, but we have a very ambitious growth plan ahead, and we feel really good about the structure we have in place. Of course, we'll always be tuning and balancing that over time, but I feel blessed and lucky to have the creative leadership and the creative talent that we do to achieve the things that we have planned."

The amount of players, the amount of time play spent, the amount of connections plays having the game, the amount of touch points the players have and, of course, revenue generation from that growing player base. 
I think as we project forward, what they have done from the very beginning is ensure that they always protect the game community, that they're very close and listen to the gaming community and offering all that community wants. The day-to-day retention is off the charts for free-to-play game, and that's why we're confident in projecting future growth around both the existing business and of course, Apex Mobile. 
And what we've talked about is releasing or soft launching Apex Mobile later this year. As is the nature of mobile games, we have a series of closed beta tests, open beta tests and then soft launches to ensure we're appropriately treating the metrics. We've not got big numbers in our plan this year for, Blake can comment more on that. But what we've really done is apply the same orientation the team has had around the core franchise, which is let's make sure that they employ right. Let's make sure we get the event strategy around the gameplay right. And let's make sure we're listening to players and delivering on what players want out of that experience. That has grown every meaningful metric of Apex Legends every single season since launch. And our expectation is that we'll also be able to grow that in the same way in mobile."

One is we have incredible ambition around Battlefield. We've got Dice, Stockholm, Dice L.A.. Criterion, our technology team in Gothenburg and our entire team, quite honestly, focused on making this the best possible battlefield that can be. We've made tremendous progress. The teams have admirable ambition to be truly creative and innovative experience. And having Criterion who have delivered some of the most amazing experiences in our history and have worked really closely with Dutch in the past, come together to help realize the fullness of that ambition was just a no-brainer for us this year. 
What has also happened, of course, is we had acquired Codemasters, and a number of new racing games, including the F1 franchise, which is shaping up to be strong this year. And it was an opportunity for us to really think more broadly about our holistic racing strategy. Need for Speed will absolutely be a meaningful part of our future. We actually think there is -- with the culmination of EA and Codemasters, we can actually expand and extend and enhance our franchise. But those 2 things together meant that having Criterion work on Battlefield this year was absolutely the right choice for us."

And they are experts in driving flying, the things that are really hard to do. And so it's not the first time that we pulled them into projects and they love it. They love to be able, and this -- we've tried to create a culture where people want to work together. And I think that's what you're seeing here versus some other idea that, well, something must be wrong. No, no, this is an opportunity talent in at the right time. And we always are measuring how that might impact future schedules. But as Andrew said, with the addition of Codemasters, we have a plethora of driving game opportunities right now that we can go after and Criterion will continue to work on those going forward."

We basically took their forecast that we used when we did the acquisition, which were fairly consistent with what they had done in the past. We didn't -- we wanted to make sure we didn't overinflate those. We wanted to make sure we were pretty consistent with how they have talked about their [indiscernible] So you should assume they're pretty similar to what you've seen historically. 
In terms of the onetime costs, they are cash costs. They are, in most cases, there might be some tax or R&D capitalization that occurs that will go into our P&L. But at the end of the day, the core cost in OpEx are things like deal fees, legal fees, closing fees, integration fees. And those impact mainly the first quarter and not the full year. 
But there will be longer term -- on our GAAP EPS, there will be some accounting for acquisitions that are collection of buying in of IP, which is a positive, right, because they have great IP; some amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition and some onetime cash tax charges that may impact cash taxes and cash flow. The other 2 that I mentioned most likely will not impact cash flow. 
So -- but we wanted to make sure we were transparent about that. I would not worry about it because I think we will be able to continue to grow these businesses and generate higher returns off the businesses than they have in the past. And as I said, we did not put into our forecast any of the synergies associated with those acquisitions yet. More to come on that in a couple -- next couple of quarters. It just -- we literally just closed Glu, what, a few weeks ago and Codemasters a month ago. So we're just getting to a point where we truly understand what the integrations are going to look like, what the cash and noncash charges will look like. We'll keep everyone informed. 
I would say it is not a big swing in the year on a non-GAAP side. It's only a swing on the GAAP EPS side just because of the way the accounting works for acquisition."

On EA Play, I think that typically, E3 governed the key promotional time frame across most of the industry happened in June. Given COVID and virtual marketing and the nature of these things, I think we've been able to kind of think about what's the most appropriate time line for us. And given the launch schedules in our games, we feel like July is the right time frame from that. 
But what I'd also say is, as we talked about, you'll hear a lot from our [indiscernible] build in June. And we'll kind of ramp up to that July. So it's not like you won't hear anything from us until July. The July time frame just optimally time for our title better suits us. We've showed up in June in the past because the whole industry has at that time. But with the world that we live in now, we have greater flexibility to do what's more relevant for our business. 
With respect to current-generation versus next-generation titles or maybe we should say current-generation versus past-generation platform titles, this is [indiscernible] we have done exceptionally well for decades. I had a great growing up in this company and building games on multiple generations. And I think when you think about our infrastructure around our Frostbite team, our digital services teams and our game teams who have unbelievably experience gaining the very best out of the past generation consoles to ensure that even as we move to the next generation, we're getting more and more out of the old generation platforms. And so those games are going to look great. 
When we think about new platform generations, again, with the advances that we're making [indiscernible] with the advances that we make in our digital ecosystem and with the advances that we're making at a feature design level with the new unlocks that come from power, the games on next-generation consoles are going to be extraordinary. Remember, we've already launched FIFA and Madden on those platforms. It's only going into year 2 of those. And we gained a lot of learning with our other franchises as we move into the second year of the platform."

The only other thing I would add to that is, remember, if our business is approaching 70-plus percent live services, what is critical is getting people into a franchise because once they're in a franchise or in a social network with other people that love the same thing they do and that means they'll engage in a live service, which means they're going to stay longer, they may spend. But most importantly, it becomes something that they do for a long time because it is that network that holds them together. 
You love football, you want to engage in football with all the people that love the same thing you do, the same team, the same league, whatever it might be. So part of the logic around building out the subscription platform on multiple vehicles is making sure we're continuing to bring people [indiscernible] services, which we know people will love over time to play."

I want to start today by saying welcome to our newest teammates from Codemasters, Glu Mobile and Metalhead Software. We're very excited to have added these incredibly talented teams to the EA family, and we're looking forward to creating some amazing new experiences together.  
FY '21 was a record year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our games continues to expand worldwide, leading industry transformation and fueling demand from a new generation of players that will continue for years to come. We delivered 13 new games in FY '21 and welcomed more than 42 million new players to our network of more than 500 million unique accounts. The tremendous engagement across our leading live services is a powerful demonstration our players are coming together and forming social networks through our experiences.  
We drove net bookings growth of more than $600 million above our original guidance for the fiscal year and achieved bottom line results significantly ahead of our expectations. Our teams continue to deliver for our players despite the challenges of the pandemic, and our execution of long-term strategies to create exceptional high-quality experiences, drive growth through our leading live services and expand our reach to more players are continuing to build strength in our business.  
As we look forward to FY '22, we are accelerating, powered by organic growth in our existing business, development of new businesses and layering growth from recent acquisitions. We're forecasting growth in FY '22. Our net bookings guidance reflects 18% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion. This includes organic growth in our core business and the addition of Glu, Codemasters and Metalhead acquisitions. From this position of strength, we are also investing in the future of our business, and we expect to continue to grow underlying profitability.  
I want to spend time today on 3 primary growth drivers for us in FY '22, expanding the EA SPORTS business, growing our Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises and our mobile growth strategy. We have a foundational strategy for growing these blockbuster brands that we are applying here, best-in-class premium experiences, deeply engaging live services that create social networks in our games and expansion of more platforms, new business models and new geographies.  
The model is how we've got FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL and The Sims into some of the most successful global live service businesses in the industry, and we are applying it as a blueprint across our franchises. As the undisputed leader in sports games, EA SPORTS is moving from strength to strength as we grow our current business and include more sports and reach new audiences. In FY '21, our EA SPORTS games brought players together at record levels. Our EA SPORTS FIFA experiences continue to engage more than 100 million players worldwide.  
More than 20 million players played FIFA Ultimate Team in the last year, and FIFA Ultimate Team matches were up an incredible 180%. Madden NFL had its biggest year ever, and games across our EA SPORTS portfolio continue to acquire more players than ever before. We'll now build on that strength with a massive year of innovation and expansion. All of our new EA SPORTS games in FY '22 are designed for next-gen console platforms including FIFA, Madden, NHL and EA SPORTS PGA TOUR, our return to golf that is set for Q4 of this year.  
We're very excited by the opportunity to deliver for baseball fans around the world with the addition of Super Mega Baseball from Metalhead Software and MLB Tap Sports Baseball on mobile from the 
[Audio Gap]    
EA SPORTS is also publishing the highest-rated sports franchise in the world with F1 2021, our first title from our recently completed Codemasters acquisition. And with the combined expertise of the Glu and EA teams focused on engaging more sports fans, we plan to grow our sports mobile business by over 50% this year.  
We continue to see the consumption of sports move from linear to interactive, representing a major growth opportunity for us, spanning more sports and more platforms, especially mobile. From premium experiences to live services to mobile, EA SPORTS is in an unparalleled position to achieve more players with new ways to play, watch and connect. With Apex Legends and Battlefield, we have 2 leading franchises in that category. We are positioned for continued growth in FY '22 through new launches, expansion of mobile and preparing for the addition of new business models that will expand our total addressable audience.  
Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year and we are forecasting continued growth. Season 8 saw well over 12 million weekly active users, the highest levels we've seen since Season 1 in 2019. We're also seeing explosive growth for Apex in Asia, especially in Japan, where it has grown significantly in the last 3 quarters.  
As Respawn continues to deliver more new content and evolve the main game this year, we are also beginning regional beta testing of Apex Legends Mobile. This is a new experience designed specifically for touchscreens, which we expect to launch worldwide later this fiscal year. Apex Legends continues to have tremendous momentum and is growing in every dimension. We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY '22, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game.  
We are realizing the next phase of growth in our vision for Battlefield with 2 new experiences launching in FY '22. Three world-class studios, DICE Stockholm, Criterion and DICE LA and our technology team in Gothenburg now form our largest ever Battlefield development team. They are working in lockstep to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for Battlefield fans.  
The game has everything fans love about Battlefield: epic scale, all-out warfare, unexpected moments and game-changing destruction. And it takes it all to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and PCs. We're excited to reveal the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout this summer. We also have a Battlefield game for mobile platforms in development and industrial toys in close partnership with DICE. Built from the ground up for mobile, the game is going into early testing now, and we're looking forward to players around the world getting a hand on this innovative Battlefield experience later in FY '22.  
As I mentioned before, our strategy is to grow Battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Apex. Best-in-class gameplay, deeply engaging live service, a new mobile experience and more ways to play that we'll introduce to reach more players all over the world.  
Throughout FY '22, we will continue transforming mobile into a growth center for our business. With the recent reorganization and hiring of new leadership and talent into our EA Mobile teams, we are in a position to maximize our leading mobile live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Sims and Real Racing by growing player acquisition, deepening engagement and player investment and driving new opportunities in non-Western markets.  
We'll grow in sports model with innovation in our leading franchises, including FIFA, Madden and UFC as well as the addition of MLB Tap Sports Baseball to our mobile sports portfolio. We expect our 2 biggest shooter franchises to launch on mobile for the first time in FY '22, which is another demonstration of our multi-platform strategy for leading global franchises. With the addition of Glu late into our EA Mobile growth plans, we expect to more than double our Mobile business to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next 3 years.  
We have a year of strong growth ahead in FY '22, and we see many more opportunities as we continue to lead in the expansion and transformation of the industry. We have a very clear long-term growth strategy for our biggest blockbuster franchises. This is the foundation of our business, and you're seeing us grow all major platforms and business models. We're thrilled to have the team from Codemasters, Glu and Metalhead join the Electronic [Audio Gap] and together, we expect to develop many games and experiences that will delight our growing player base and be catalysts for growth in the years to come.  
We have a deep pipeline of new content, including new franchises and new IP, deeper focus on mobile games and experiences that will lean into user-generated content. We're also continuing to invest in opportunities where we have differentiated ability to reach and engage more players, including our growing subscription service and our esports content and competitions that will expand in scope this year.  
The 3 growth drivers that I've focused on today, expanding our EA SPORTS portfolio, growing our blockbuster shooter franchises and the transformation of our Mobile business provide clear growth and significant upside for Electronic Arts in FY '22 and beyond.  We're excited to bring some amazing new games and content to our players and viewers around the world this year. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion, which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Ap",984,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily and extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion, which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Apex's phenomenal engagement stats. As a result of this engagement, Apex delivered its largest net bookings quarter on record. It also delivered the best day, the best 24-hour period, the best week, the best month and best in-game event.  
We suggested it would deliver over $1 billion in life-to-date net bookings by the end of the quarter. It actually passed that milestone with half of the quarter to go. Apex Legends delivered over $600 million for the year, well above our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. Importantly, Apex Legends steadily grew through the year. While Apex surely benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind, the upwards trajectory is driven by the game teams and the content they are delivering. That is the strength -- that is, this strength is structural, to the point Season 8 was the first season built by a new content team we put together in Vancouver, proving our ability to scale resources on our fastest-growing franchise.  
Our 2 major shooter franchises, Apex Legends and Battlefield, and our ongoing strength in the Ultimate Team provides a tremendous foundation for growth in FY '22. The addition of Glu and Codemasters accelerates this to 18% revenue growth year-on-year.  
I'll go through the details of our guidance in a moment. First though, I thought I'd start with a quick look at what we achieved in fiscal 2021. We closed out the year with $5.63 billion in net revenue. We delivered net bookings of $6.19 billion, the highest in our history and about $640 million above our original expectations. Underlying profit was also an all-time record, as was full year operating cash flow of $1.93 billion.  
Of that $6.19 billion in net bookings, $4.6 billion was live services. There couldn't be a more dramatic illustration of the way the business has evolved, with our focus on engagement and ongoing entertainment now generating 3/4 of our net bookings. To give some perspective, that $4.6 billion is equivalent to the sale of around 130 million copies of console games.  
Digital represents 62% of our full game units sold in fiscal 2021 for consoles, up 13 percentage points from last year.  
Turning to Q4, specifically. The beat was driven by live services, primarily Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. Mobile also beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and SimCity BuildIt. Operating expenses came in slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by acquisition-related expenses.  
Now turning to guidance. We expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.8 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.828 billion and earnings per share of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We expect operating cash flows of $1.75 billion and capital expenditures to be around $250 million, which would deliver free cash flow of around $1.5 billion.  
Cash flow is down year-on-year, primarily due to tax integration costs associated with the acquisitions. The level of these costs reflect the strength of the IP Glu and Codemasters have developed and bring to EA. CapEx is up temporarily with office build-outs in Bucharest, Los Angeles, Orlando and the United Kingdom. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.  
We expect fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $7.3 billion, up about 18% over fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022 and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year. In sports, we expect FIFA and Madden to be strong and we're launching a new PGA Tour golf game. F1 2021, developed by Codemasters, and which now sits under the EA SPORTS banner as well, will launch on July 16.  
And of course, rounding out the year for our shooter franchises is the launch of Battlefield in the holiday season. Because this is the first time we're forecasting Glu and Codemasters, we took a very conservative posture on net bookings from those businesses. In addition, we're not yet modeling any synergies from the 2 acquisitions. For fiscal 2022, we've assumed simple addition of their existing businesses into EA. Revenue and synergies will come further out as we [Audio Gap] with Glu Mobile expertise to build out a suite of new casual mobile games, leverage our sports know-how with Codemasters' F1 franchise and others, and implement a holistic strategy for racing games.  
Meanwhile, OpEx this year will be impacted by some onetime costs associated with the acquisitions. We're also leaning heavily into our biggest franchises, with increased R&D investments and marketing ahead of key launches from Battlefield and Apex Mobile. We expect these near-term investments to pay off in years to come. For the quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.475 billion, cost of revenue to be $287 million and operating expenses of $955 million. This results in an earnings per share of $0.24 for the first quarter.  
We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.25 billion. We expect Apex Legends' momentum will carry through to fiscal 2022. We've seen the game already. We believe our financial model of Battlefield may be conservative. And we're looking forward to player reaction when we reveal this game next month.  
In addition, we're very excited for the franchise as a whole as we add new platforms and business models. We expect strong organic growth this year, growth that is further accelerated by the addition of talented teams at Codemasters and Glu and Metalhead. It is an exciting time for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand it back to Andrew."

Clearly, Apex has driven a huge change in that business. It's up dramatically year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone, year-over-year, it's up 145%. And the way we've done that, as you know, is continue to add amazing content, amazing characters, amazing things for people to play, and it's engaging more and more people all the time. 
While COVID, as horrible as it has been, brought a lot of people into gaming. And what we've done is try to do our best to bring more and more people into social networks around the games they love, be it sports, be it a shooter game, be it The Sims. And that's what we've been able to leverage over time, and those people stay in those social networks because they enjoy the game and enjoy the people they're playing with. 
And so we see, across all of our live services, Ultimate Team, Apex, The Sims, all of our mobile games that has helped us get the confidence that we could give a guidance that we just provided for next year. And I think you're going to continue to see that as a huge part of our business. It's going to be a huge part of the industry's business, as we've already seen, but it will continue on for us, and we'll continue to add to that with new content, new ways to play, new opportunities for people to deeply get connected with other people that like what they like to do."

Across the rest of our studio structure, I also feel really, really good about our leadership and all of our creative talent there.

The day-to-day retention is off the charts for free-to-play game, and that's why we're confident in projecting future growth around both the existing business and of course, Apex Mobile. 
And what we've talked about is releasing or soft-launching Apex Mobile later this year. As is the nature of mobile games, we have a series of closed beta tests, open beta tests and then soft launches to ensure we're appropriately treating the metrics. We've now got big numbers in our plan this year forth, Blake can comment more on that. But what we've really done is apply the same orientation the team has had around the core franchise, which is let's make sure we get the gameplay right, let's make sure we get the event strategy around the gameplay right and let's make sure we're listening to players and delivering on what players want out of that experience.

We're able to resolve those very quickly. Just the nature of demand was so extraordinary. In terms of do we expect that just to engage more existing players by bringing new plays, I think we believe both of those things will happen. What you have seen from the Apex team each and every season, and whether it's launching new maps, new characters or new modalities of play, every season has grown both players and the engagement of the existing player base and the player investment that comes from those 2 things. 
And so it's too early to tell other than to say, Season 8 was the biggest season since Season 1 in 2019. And Season 9 as of right now looks like it will be bigger than Season 8, meaningfully so.

The other thing that you should know and I talked about in the prepared remarks is we do have a blueprint, which is how do we start with a AAA premium experience that is truly innovative in its category? How do we build out live service for long-term engagement? And then how do we think about modalities of play in business models to further extend our reach and penetration of that game on a global basis across platforms, across geographies, across business models?

And having Criterion who have delivered some of the most amazing experiences in our history and have worked really closely with DICE in the past, come together to help realize the fullness of that ambition was just a no-brainer for us this year. 
What has also happened, of course, is we had acquired Codemasters and a number of new racing games, including the F1 franchise, which is shaping up to be really strong this year. And it was an opportunity for us to really think more broadly about our holistic racing strategy. Need for Speed will absolutely be a meaningful part of our future.

We didn't -- we wanted to make sure we didn't overinflate those. We wanted to make sure we were pretty consistent with how they have talked about their [Audio Gap]. So you should assume they're pretty similar to what you've seen historically. 
In terms of the onetime costs, they are cash costs. They are, in most cases, there might be some tax or R&D capitalization that occurs that will go into our P&L. But at the end of the day, the core cost in OpEx are things like deal fees, legal fees, closing fees, integration fees. And those impact mainly the first quarter and not the full year. 
But there will be longer term a -- on our GAAP EPS, there will be some accounting for acquisitions that are collection of buying in of IP, which is a positive, right, because they have great IP; some amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition and some onetime cash tax charges that may impact cash taxes and cash flow. The other 2 that I mentioned most likely will not impact cash flow. 
So -- but we wanted to make sure we were transparent about that. I would not worry about it because I think we will be able to continue to grow these businesses and generate higher returns off the businesses than they have in the past. And as I said, we did not put into our forecast any of the synergies associated with those acquisitions yet. More to come on that in a couple -- next couple of quarters. It just -- we literally just closed Glu, what, a few weeks ago and Codemasters a month ago. So we're just getting to a point where we truly understand what the integrations are going to look like, what the cash and noncash charges will look like. We'll keep everyone informed. 
I would say it is not a big swing in the year on a non-GAAP side. It's only a swing on the GAAP EPS side just because of the way the accounting works for acquisition."

Given COVID and virtual marketing and the nature of these things, I think we've been able to kind of think about what's the most appropriate time line for us. And given the launch schedules in our games, we feel like July is the right time frame from that. 
But what I'd also say is, as we talked about, you'll hear a lot from our build in June. And we'll kind of ramp up to that July. So it's not like you won't hear anything from us until July. The July time frame, just optimally time for our title launches, better suits us. We've showed up in June in the past because the whole industry has at that time. But with the world that we live in now, we have greater flexibility to do what's more relevant for our business. 
With respect to current-generation versus next-generation titles or maybe we should say current-generation versus past-generation platform titles, this is [Audio Gap] we have done exceptionally well for decades. I have a great fortune of growing up in this company and building games on multiple generations. And I think when you think about our infrastructure around our Frostbite team, our digital services teams and our game teams who have unbelievable experience gaining the very best out of the past generation consoles to ensure that even as we move to the next generation, we're getting more and more out of the old generation platforms. And so those games are going to look great. 
When we think about new platform generations, again, with the advances that we make in Frostbite, with the advances that we make in our digital ecosystem and with the advances that we're making at a feature design level with the new unlocks that come from power, the games on next-generation consoles are going to be extraordinary. And remember, we've already launched FIFA and Madden on those platforms. It's only going into year 2 of those. And we gained a lot of learning with our other franchises as we move into the second year of the platform."

But if you look at Q2 through Q4 of last year, what you saw is still strength, not strength of Q1 but still strength every quarter, beating guidance every quarter, unbelievable strength across Ultimate Team, Apex and others. 
And to Andrew's point, we were able to steer people into games and social networks that were very [Audio Gap] for them and they stayed around. And we're seeing that trend going forward. And even if we all go back to, maybe someday, normal life, which we all hope, we believe we've brought a lot of new people into games and into social networks that they want to be in and they enjoy being in and will continue to play in. So we -- no one quite knows how to predict COVID going forward, but we're very confident that we have done something that we never anticipated at the start of last year. But it has worked to our advantage to bring people into games that they love and networks that they love and we think that will help us long term. 
So with that, I think that was our last question. We appreciate everybody's constant attention and help and look forward to seeing people hopefully in person one day, but if not, by Zoom. So thank you for everybody taking your time today."

I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EAPlay-live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Blue Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content. 
Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and life services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever. 
Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities: the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content, the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers: building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile. 
EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, which FUT matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever. 
We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers. 
Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new hyper motion technology powered innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; an EA SPORTS PGA Tour, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, the Masters at Augusta National, the Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship and the PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future. 
With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect. 
Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest play accounts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise. 
During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulative generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record leadership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community. 
More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching ears, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer. 
There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP. 
Our third growth driver is live services, our core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG lifestyle and racing. 
Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broad audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy. 
Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,715867508,2363671,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launche",1079,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion. 
Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster -- by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside. 
Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago. 
We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Gul Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball, and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team leveraged by our global commercial operation. 
We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042. 
Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations. 
Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. 
We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying, profit and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. 
Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion, with capital expenditures remaining around $250 million. That would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. 
For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. 
With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. Our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. 
I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He's interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. 
Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worand for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for an amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost, Andrew?"

What I can say is it's one of the great games from our catalog there has been extraordinary demand to bring it back for existing players and next generation of players, and we're excited to kind of add that to the portfolio over time. And we'll be able to share more as development continues. But I would just -- I would close on that point by saying it was one of the most demanded titles for us, maybe just after Skate, which we've also announced we're bringing back, and the response was very positive to the announcement that we're back in development. 
Around name image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of naming and lightness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around an image likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name image and lightness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context. And we are building the architecture of the game with a database structure so that if and when that comes online, we'll be able to add back to the game very seamlessly."

Our FIFA Ultimate team are always working very closely with our community of players. FIFA Ultimate Team is the most played mode in that game by a wide margin. And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Premium pack, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. 
With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer change names football and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around hypermotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. 
So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet. And we believe we have the best team to do that, and we'll look to continue to do that over time."

And you know what? We've always tried to build the business on a collection of great titles, not one title because one title always poses risk. And so our view is a collection of the titles with great live services associated with them -- and you're going to see that over the next -- not just next year but for the next many years to come. That's how we've tried to build our business. And I think you'll hear more about it. We're not trying to give guidance right now on next year.

On do we think Battlefield will return to an every other year launch, I would say -- I think that is our orientation. But more importantly, I think you should think about Battlefield as a service what we announced -- what we're doing for the launch of this game is really revolutionizing and reinventing what -- all our epic scale warfare is in the context of gameplay. In addition to that, we've heard us announce Battlefield Portal, which really starts to lean into user-generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game. 
And while we've announced Hazard Zone is a name we have to disclose a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free to anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while -- and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on. 
Then I think your -- the other part of your question was naming lightness college sports and does that open up an opportunity on basketball. I would tell you our focus right now is football. But what you've also heard us talk about is really building on our strength in sports. We believe this is a unique strength for us. We're the leading company when it comes to delivering multiple high-quality sports across -- at global scale, and it would not be a match for us in a world where we start to develop more into college football to start expand that to other college sports as well."

And we wouldn't have raised our full year guidance if we didn't feel that was a potential for us, and I think it's an upside for the company longer term during the year. 
You're going to hear a lot more over the next couple of months about Battlefield live services, in-game monetization and so forth. I can't tell you all that now, but trust that the team is working very hard on this, and they have some very unique ideas about what we can continue to do, what Andrew just said, to create this as a long-term interaction with our consumers versus simply selling a game this year.

But as you've seen with F1 already, we've been able to drive more sales than what we've seen historically with that business, and we'll continue to do that across all of the portfolio of companies. 
I would say in the case of Playdemic and in the case of Glu, Tap Sports Baseball and Metalhead with their baseball game and Playdemic's golf game, we are going to leverage their strengths as best as possible to try to find ways to create more and better casual games in mobile -- on mobile than we have in the past. And that's not to say that we haven't done a good job on mobile. We have, but the potential that we have -- if you look at what Playdemic's done, the potential we have with something like a global FIFA game or a global Madden game where we already have the licenses, there is huge upside. 
I can't give you what those numbers look like yet. But I will tell you that the reason we did these deals was to try to make sure we brought the talent in that could help us expand our capabilities on more casual sports games around the globe and more casual games in general around the globe.

And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions, we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn as obviously driven the amazing development of Apex, but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now -- it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day, it is amazing what our teams are able to do. 
I would tell you, to your earlier part of the question, we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired, and it doesn't -- it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that, and you have to have great products to do that.

What I would tell you though in aggregate is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. 
And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to. And as we think about building ongoing interactive entertainment experiences, this is why you hear us leading into the social ecosystems in and around our games because this is what drives longevity and it's what drives deepening engagement in our business.

We think it's important -- in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road if that's where we want to go.

It's hard to understand exactly where the world is going to go. I think it's unlikely that we have events without fans in the stadiums, and we may just see some protocols around masks and/or testing and/or vaccination. But our whole sports fans is that we get fans back in stadiums. 
I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the forms of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games. So net-net, notwithstanding any further challenges around the pandemic, it's almost certainly a positive for us."

Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. 
And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of ultimate teams.  We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. 
And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working for home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team."

Again, when we think about Ultimate Team, it's a long-term balanced way to connect your friends in and around the sport. And it has become that and it's certainly the most played mode in FIFA and very strong in lot of franchises. As we think about this, 2/3 of people who play Ultimate Team don't actually buy packs and only 9 out of 10 packs are opened with earned coins. And so we're always trying to ensure that constant balance of engagement and enjoyment of our player community. 
And what we saw with premium packs was we saw a higher incidence of new players coming in Ultimate Team and we saw high conversion of those new players in and around buying packs and participating in the digital ecosystem. So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and premium packs is one of those examples."

I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. 
It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EA Play Live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Glu Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content.  
Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and live services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever.  
Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities: the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content; the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers: building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile.  
EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, with FUT Matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever.  
We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers.  
Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new HyperMotion technology powers innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; and EA SPORTS PGA TOUR, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, The Masters at Augusta National, The Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship, and The PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega Baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future.  
With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect.  
Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest player counts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like Arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise.  
During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulatively generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record viewership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked-about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community.  
More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching eras, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer.  
There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP.  
Our third growth driver is live services, a core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG, lifestyle and racing.  
Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broader audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy.  
Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,715867508,2363838,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launche",1080,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion.  
Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster -- by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside.  
Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago.  
We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Glu Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team, leveraged by our global commercial operation.  
We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042.  
Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations.  
Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic, given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program.  
We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying profitability and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. 
Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high-single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion. With capital expenditures remaining around $250 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. 
For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends, plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. 
With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. And our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. 
I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He has interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. 
Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worn for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for his amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost Andrew."

That could be a huge driver in profitability going forward. We have the potential of live services around Battlefield as well as a Battlefield mobile game coming up. And we clearly have other games planned, such as a Need for Speed or others that are coming, which you'll hear more about in the future. But you can imagine.

Around name, image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of name, image and likeness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around name, image and likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name, image and likeness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context.

And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Preview Packs, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. 
With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer changes its name to eFootball and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around HyperMotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. 
So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet. And we believe we have the best team to do that, and we'll look to continue to do that over time."

In addition to that, we've heard us announce Battlefield Portal, which really starts to lean into user-generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game. 
And while we've announced Hazard Zone is the a name. We haven't disclosed a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free-to-anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while -- and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on. 
Then I think your -- the other part of your question was name, image and likeness college sports and does that open up an opportunity on basketball. I would tell you our focus right now is football. But what you've also heard us talk about is really building on our strength in sports. We believe this is a unique strength for us.

What I would tell you, though, in aggregate, is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. 
And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to.

I think what I talked about in my prepared remarks is the very detailed nature that the Respawn team and the Apex team takes the ongoing development of this experience and the support of their growing global communities. And it's really about -- on any given day, it's really thinking about what enhancement, extensions, innovations they can add to core gameplay, that moment-to-moment gameplay. There is -- how can they think about new modalities of play like arenas, which changes kind of the broader rule set of how you engage in that moment-to-moment gameplay. And how do they add content with the legend and with all of the extra stuff in and around that, that drives more interest. 
And I think what we're seeing now is that team really started to deeply understand using data and using a close relationship they have with the community, continue to enhance gameplay, continue to add modalities of play and continue to double down on a really interesting, unique content that the community really gravitates towards. And I think as you think about that in the context, we're now taking that new geographies and new platforms. This is why we're so confident in the ongoing strength of that franchise."

And what I would say on the advertising side is right or wrong, we've never had a large advertising business. It covers around $100 million a year. Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile, it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave their network to go play somewhere else. 
We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising, and we may change our views over time. We think it's important -- in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road, if that's where we want to go. 
And more to come on that. We're just -- we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules, new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising free-to-play world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game. And we'll see how that plays out over time."

I think it's unlikely that we have events without fans in the stadiums, and we may just see some protocols around masks and/or testing and/or vaccination. But our hope, as sports fan, is that we get fans back in stadiums. 
I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the fullness of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games. So net-net, notwithstanding any further challenges around the pandemic, it's almost certainly a positive for us."

Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. 
And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of Ultimate Teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. 
And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working from home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team."

So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and Preview Packs is one of those examples."

I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. 
It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EA Play Live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Glu Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content.  
Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and live services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever.  
Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities: the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content; the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers: building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile.  
EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, with FUT Matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever.  
We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers.  
Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new HyperMotion technology powers innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; and EA SPORTS PGA TOUR, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, The Masters at Augusta National, The Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship, and The PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega Baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future.  
With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect.  
Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest player counts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like Arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise.  
During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulatively generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record viewership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked-about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community.  
More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching eras, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer.  
There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP.  
Our third growth driver is live services, a core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG, lifestyle and racing.  
Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broader audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy.  
Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,715867508,2363840,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launche",1080,"Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion.  
Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster -- by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside.  
Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago.  
We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Glu Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team, leveraged by our global commercial operation.  
We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042.  
Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations.  
Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic, given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program.  
We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying profitability and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. 
Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high-single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion. With capital expenditures remaining around $250 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. 
For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends, plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. 
With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. And our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. 
I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He has interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. 
Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worn for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for his amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. 
So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost Andrew."

Around name, image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of name, image and likeness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around name, image and likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name, image and likeness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context.

And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Preview Packs, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. 
With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer changes its name to eFootball and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around HyperMotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. 
So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet.

And while we've announced Hazard Zone is the a name. We haven't disclosed a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free-to-anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while -- and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on.

I can't give you what those numbers look like yet.

There's no negative on the F1 team because they are exceptional. It was could we quickly -- I mean we didn't own the business for that long. So could we quickly integrate the teams, our marketing and publishing efforts to try and drive that business as fast as we did? That's probably where we might have had some questions. And actually, we've well exceeded that. And it's to the testament of an exceptional game development team that was able to produce the right assets, to produce the right marketing materials to help us drive this business and the teams working together. 
And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions, we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn has obviously driven the amazing development of Apex, but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now -- it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day, it is amazing what our teams are able to do. 
I would tell you, to your earlier part of the question, we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired, and it doesn't -- it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that, and you have to have great products to do that. And so I would tell you that the combination of great teams and great marketers is really powerful in this industry, and I think we've been able to prove that we can do that across all the acquisitions that we've done in the last 4 or 5 years."

And I would jump in. On your point around restrictions and are we seeing anything different, I would tell you given the rollercoaster nature of opening up and shutting down and lockdowns and various restrictions that are happening in various geographies and territories globally, it's almost hard to track at this juncture who is open and who is closed. What I would tell you, though, in aggregate, is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. 
And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to. And as we think about building ongoing interactive entertainment experiences, this is why you hear us leading into the social ecosystems in and around our games because this is what drives longevity and it's what drives deepening engagement in our business. And so I think what we're seeing right now is the world is in different phases in different places. But on aggregate, engagement in and around our games continues to be extremely strong."

There is -- how can they think about new modalities of play like arenas, which changes kind of the broader rule set of how you engage in that moment-to-moment gameplay. And how do they add content with the legend and with all of the extra stuff in and around that, that drives more interest. 
And I think what we're seeing now is that team really started to deeply understand using data and using a close relationship they have with the community, continue to enhance gameplay, continue to add modalities of play and continue to double down on a really interesting, unique content that the community really gravitates towards. And I think as you think about that in the context, we're now taking that new geographies and new platforms. This is why we're so confident in the ongoing strength of that franchise."

Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile, it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave their network to go play somewhere else. 
We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising, and we may change our views over time. We think it's important -- in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road, if that's where we want to go. 
And more to come on that. We're just -- we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules, new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising free-to-play world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game.

But our hope, as sports fan, is that we get fans back in stadiums. 
I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the fullness of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games.

Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. 
And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of Ultimate Teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. 
And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working from home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team."

So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and Preview Packs is one of those examples."

Let me begin with a big thank you to our teams who continue to work from home and do amazing things for our players. I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic who are now officially part of our Electronic Arts team. We're thrilled to have them on board, adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We are growing with our leading franchises, new launches and live services all performing well during the quarter, and our acquisitions are driving additional growth beyond our core business.
With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we are connecting players all over the world through each other through more of our favorite content. As a result, net revenue, net bookings and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we are now raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year. Our core strategy is built on 4 key opportunities; the creation of amazing games and content, tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, the aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models and geographies, and and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games.
As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22; expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today. With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform reach, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield and the Sims are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment. Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry, a brand-new IP that has scaled to more than 100 million players and is closing in on $1 billion in net bookings annually. Season 9 and Season 10 each respectively set new marks for the highest active players in season 1, and Q2 was the biggest quarter of in-game spending in APAC that we've had to date.
Apex has grown beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than 130 million hours of Season 10 content watched to date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay, embedded in an immersive world of law and characters that continues to expand. Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection events keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode. The Apex Legends esports ecosystem is growing as well, with the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now underway. Apex is moving from strength to strength, and we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year.
Battlefield, a number of our blockbuster properties, is beloved by tens of means of fans ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2042 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 open beta in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had. Given an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small slice of the game in our open data, we brought players into the full-scale 128 player combat and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped our teams with areas of the game play to polish and refine as we move towards launch. We've now revealed all 3 of the games pillars, all-out warfare with 128 player multiplay in conquest and breakthrough modes, Battlefield portal, a new way to play that has the community very excited to create their own battlefield experiences and Hazard Zone with completely new focused combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love. We're looking forward to players getting to all of these experiences when the full Battlefield 2032 game launches from November '19.
Through FY '22, we continue to grow our leadership in sports through new games, acquisitions and new areas of expansion. Our global football or soccer, for us in the North America, franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world with approximately 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. EA SPORTS FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2 is after the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation in our new high promotion technology revolutionized gameplay and is inspired, engaged and grown the community. Total players were up 16% and newer franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch with net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with ultimate team engagement up 15% year-over-year and more players coming into volta and career modes. There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including mobile, where later this fiscal year, we will bring new modes, new features and improve gameplay at FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience to date. For nearly 30 years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world.
Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport. With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license partners, including the Premier League, UEFA, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, the MLS, FietPro and many more and our expertise in growth areas, including esports and mobile, EA SPORTS is ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world. We have opportunities in new modalities of play and new social experiences that will bring more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around their game. And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms, bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's leagues, teams and players.
We are more confident than ever about our bright future football, and we will grow our franchisees' leadership with our partners around the world. We are continually investing in innovation, creativity and authenticity to bring EA SPORTS games closer to the heart of real world sports and fans. Engagement in NFL 22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refresh franchise mode and Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends. We've grown the F1 business year-over-year as F1 2021 from Codemasters continues to bring in more plans and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 title fight in years.
NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began, with a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. With a portfolio that now spans global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, Gulf, UFC fighting and racing, no other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams and partners as EA SPORTS. We have the unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate fan communities enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.
Expanding live service across our portfolio, particularly in mobile is our third growth driver for FY '22. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Golf Clash mobile game. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Golf Clash as a live service and bringing the cloud mechanic to more of our sports franchises, where our licenses and expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. Our EA Mobile teams also continue to drive success in live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players live to date in Q2.
Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic and EA Mobile teams, we have built a powerful mobile native organization within EA. This group is sharply focused on accelerating growth in our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services as well as introducing new experiences that take our powerful IP, including Battlefield into the expanding mobile audience. The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer, managing company-wide operations creative leaders joining our management team and our new Chief Experience Officer, leading our efforts to grow social ecosystem, all supporting our amazing teams as we drive growth in the next era of interactive entertainment. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,715867527,2423768,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services, led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of Playdemic at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable mobile title and a blue",776,"Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services, led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of Playdemic at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable mobile title and a blueprint for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever and more than double the level of last year's.
We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year. EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle with engagement in its last couple of months up very significantly on FIFA 20 Keeping fans engaged drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double digits year-on-year based on the first 3 weeks of sales.
Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collection events this quarter, but even so, the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life to date and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year. To launch an original IP and steadily build it into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional, and I'd like to recognize the Respawn team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of Season 11.
Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement for spend on our games as countries such as the U.K. emerge from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations.
So now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.48 billion and earnings per share of $2.03, up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.65 billion. This is driven by outperformance so far this year, plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio.
Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion with capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.
As noted last quarter, CapEx is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environment and new offices around the globe. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion, cost of revenue will be $625 million and operating expenses of $1.1 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember, GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3. We expect Q3 financial 2022 net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted included last year the launch of FIFA 21 and was the largest quarter ever for Q3 in the company's history. The games in live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew."

We think we are part of the very fabric of the culture of football globally, an important part of kind of fandom for football. And when we kind of interact with our hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities at play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, esports, NFTs broader sports consumption and they want us to move really, really quickly. And so I would tell you, as we think about the future of football, we think it's very bright. We're going to work with our global collection of partners that we feel best enable us to do that.

None of it is long term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration. It just happened also quickly. You can't plan exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.
We're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team, as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position. And I think the for us, the biggest opportunity is -- and this is an obvious one, and that is how do we take our existing sports licenses and the talent that the Glus and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through that talent base and -- or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us. Obviously, FIFA but also in Madden and PGA in other areas where we can either augment their games add to their games or add new games.

I think there was some conversation around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural in beta. And we've been able to take that feedback around those constructive elements and really implement that in the game.

So we feel really good about that. I think when you think about the early access numbers and the engagement numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand. The game is very appealing. The setting is very appealing the modalities have play the innovation and creativity that and the other people that work on that game have put into the game is something that the community is receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about.
I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday. I get that on a calendar basis, it looks the same as Battlefield 5, I would tell you though, leading in the Battlefield 5, we did not see the level of demand we are seeing now. We did not have the level of innovation in the game that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high fidelity game experience that we have now. And so net-net, coming out of the data, we feel very good about play demand. The team has been working very hard on tuning and polish and filing the game where we feel really good about the game at the that the community is going to get to play on day 1.

Second is -- and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60-plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield skews even more to PCs, which means the download numbers is going to be even higher. And what that allows us to do is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from an ability to sell through a lot of games as well as not have to discount those games dramatically."

I'll just say we continue to believe -- again, I go back to Respawn as a team, have been very deliberate and thoughtful about developing and building this franchise and nurturing and growing the community and their engagement over time. And actually, I think we're just at the beginning. I think there's such tremendous upside in all that we're doing both in the existing experience on existing platforms and as we expand the mobile. But again, I have nothing to announce to you today. But when you think about the broader ecosystem of the experiences we plan to offer, I wouldn't discount the notion of adding more model as a play or even more traditional models that play to that experience over time."

And I would just note, Colin, the number of characters that are now in the game versus on day 1 are dramatically different. It just gives you a sense of how that game is continuing to evolve, not to mention the ways to play, the modalities and the maps and so forth. On the '23 question, I think you know this because we've been talking about this business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about '23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23, and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today is that optimism and excitement.
And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is now live services. And that comprises of things like Ultimate Team, Apex mobile, the Sims, it is the special sauce of what we do. It is bring people together make sure that they're part of a social network and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged and what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry. We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time basically for mainly the life of this company. And we've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time.
And when you then broaden that across the Sims and mobile titles and then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real live services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So we're very confident in growth for next year. Independent of any 1 pile because of that live service component of our business, and we're very excited about what that means going forward and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time."

I think about -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly in our sports games, again, it's different across different franchise. And so collectibility has different value over time. and collectability in games like FIFA and Madden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time. I think the short answer to that is yes. I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players, and we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy, and you are seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending, they're getting that value. But we will continue as we have evolve the ultimate team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.
To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me, it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content. There are tools to more deeply engage the community. There's the aggregation and distribution of that content to audience. And there is the ecosystem born out of the engagement that content that exists beyond the bounds of the traditional game experience. At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers starts with the games and the content that we create. And so for me, it was really saying to our creative leaders, I want to make sure that you are in the strategic conversation that's going to help us drive growth as a company. I think it is a very central strand of DNA of who we are. They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next phase of growth of this company is going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors, but it will all start with that content. And as leaders of the teams that create that content, I felt it was important to have them in the conversation."

When we think about all of our games and our big blockbuster franchises like Apex, like FIFA, like Madan, like Battlefield, like the Sims, we're always thinking about innovation and creativity at its core, how do we build that out in the modalities of play? How do we think about that across platform? How do we think about the extension of those experiences? And business model is 1 piece of that puzzle. I think when we look at our Battleford franchise today, we've acknowledged that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future. Job number one was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category. And I think that's what they have sought to do. And that's what they've achieved through this 128 player multiplayer giant expansion, more deep engagement in creativity through portal mode and innovative new modes in and around the game. I think the next phase of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield mobile title. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in and of itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we then think about further expanding the play those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now."

I'm not sure the notion of not being engaged in cosmetic content. It's a fair assessment. I think that Battlefield Premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out 12, 18, 24 months. I think we saw deep engagement from the community in that I think what we also saw though was we didn't get all of the community to engage deeply in that and some parts of the community want to engage in kind of a different profile. And so we did away with premium and we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service.
I feel good about what the team has planned now. I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend and enhance their experience and engage in a way that makes sense for them but doesn't kind of bifurcate or triplicate the community anyway. So I think that this is a great community. I think they're a core community. I think the franchise is beloved amongst them. I think what we're seeing, even having been out of the market for 3 years, is demand and appeal continues to be incredibly high. And I'm excited about what we're going to launch with the game, but I'm even more excited by the plans the team has to continue to grow and expand that experience for global player base."

I don't have specific metrics on payer conversion that I can share today other than to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements with Ultimate Team, including 1 element, which is the preview packs, we've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall. And as we've kind of rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spend or a different type of spend on the Codemasters preview packs. And so what's clear to us was this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way through our growing player community to engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to kind of evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new points of value for our players and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience.
The notion of could it evolve into other areas, I think the short answer that is absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the supplies in the light of the traditional supplies mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for a big part of the player base. And then there's another group of players that want to think differently about how they extend and enhance their experience. And you should expect that we'll take the learnings from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our mobile business and things like Apex Legends and kind of bring that back into our sports franchises. And so part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle and having 0.5 billion players in our network, engaging deepening experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio. And we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise to franchise."

We continue to work on how and why Apex works in certain markets. And there are certain markets that it is unbelievable, the strength of the franchise, where we haven't really done much of it to localize the language. Japan is a great example of that. And so the team has been working hard, particularly on the mobile build of the game to be able to localize it more to how people want to play the game in those markets.
Now you want to be careful that you don't bifurcate the game in too many ways, but there may be some ways cosmetically or beyond language adjustments to make the game more powerful in those markets. And you should have seen that assume that's an ongoing process. It is hard to see and hard for us to carve that out as part of the financials. But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow is that we are doing that, and you'll see much more of that as the mobile build starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets where people have not played the game on consumer PC because those aren't available to them. And so part of the markets that we're testing right now are those types of markets. where this is a new game for them. And so we're watching very closely as to how people play that and react to that. Do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example of certain types of gameplay. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exists."

The second element is IP. And when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle, tap sports, Baseball, Golf clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC hockey, the Sims. And so part of what Blake was saying about before is as we start to think about the integration. We have gone through and we're working with those teams and say, okay, we're working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you could take that engine and apply to the FIFA business. The Tap Sports engine or the golf clash engine to football -- European football or American portfolio. And we're in that planning phase right now. And I would say the teams themselves are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises have global reach and global strength.
The third is just kind of our network of players and how we start to work across that. Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to take that advertising engine across our player network into our other products. We're already starting to see see that benefit? And then things like Reach, we've already been able to launch TAP Sports Baseball into Japan. And so some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as a leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of mobile first talent, unbelievable portfolio of IP, a network of 0.5 billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the space of mobile."

I think there's -- we've had a lot of questions of the Respawn since the very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team has been very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have, in fact, staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in L.A. They've got another team in Vancouver that can use to work on the game and grow and develop more content. I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community, and they are building for the long term. And so the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe. But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to their community and very thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time. And that will mean sometimes it's every 3 months, sometimes it will be longer and sometimes will be shorter. But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment to continue to hire the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future.
So with that, we'll wrap up the call there. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for the great questions. Be well, and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Bye-bye."

Let me begin with a big thank you to our teams who continue to work from home and do amazing things for our players. 
I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic, who are now officially part of our Electronic Arts team. We're thrilled to have them on board, adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. 
Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We are growing with our leading franchises, new launches and live services all performing well during the quarter, and our acquisitions are driving additional growth beyond our core business.
With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we are connecting players all over the world to each other through more of their favorite content. As a result, net revenue, net bookings and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we are now raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year. 
Our core strategy is built on 4 key opportunities: The creation of amazing games and content, tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, the aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22: expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports; and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today. 
With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform reach, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield and The Sims are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment. 
Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry, a brand-new IP that has scaled to more than 100 million players and is closing in on $1 billion in net bookings annually. Season 9 and Season 10 each respectively set new marks for the highest active players in Season 1, and Q2 was the biggest quarter of in-game spending in Apex that we've had to date.
Apex has grown beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than 130 million hours of Season 10 content watched to date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay, embedded in an immersive world of lore and characters that continues to expand. 
Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection events keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode. The Apex Legends esports ecosystem is growing as well, with the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now underway. Apex is moving from strength to strength, and we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year. 
Battlefield, another of our blockbuster properties, is beloved by tens of millions of fans. Ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2042 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 Open Beta in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had. Betas are an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small slice of the game in our Open Beta, we brought players into the full-scale 128-player combat and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped our teams with areas of the gameplay to polish and refine as we move towards launch. 
We've now revealed all 3 of the games pillars: All-Out Warfare with 128-player multiplayer in Conquest and Breakthrough modes. Battlefield Portal, a new way to play that has the community very excited to create their own Battlefield experiences, and Hazard Zone with completely new squad-focused combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love. We're looking forward to players getting to all of these experiences when the full Battlefield 2042 launches from November 19.
Through FY '22, we continue to grow our leadership in sports through new games, acquisitions and new areas of expansion. Our global football or soccer, for us in the North America, franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world with approximately 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. 
EA SPORTS FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2, is off to the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation in our new HyperMotion technology  revolutionized gameplay and is inspired, engaged and grown the community. 
Total players are up 16% and new to franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch, with net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with Ultimate Team engagement up 15% year-over-year and more players coming into Volta and Career Modes. 
There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including mobile, where later this fiscal year, we will bring new modes, new features and improved gameplay to FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience to date. 
For nearly 30 years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world. Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport. With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license partners, including the Premier League, UEFA, CONMEBOL, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A, the MLS, FIFPro and many more and our expertise in growth areas including esports and mobile. EA SPORTS is ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world. 
We have opportunities in new modalities of play and new social experiences that will bring up more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around their game. And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms, bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's leagues, teams and players.
We are more confident than ever about our bright future of football, and we will grow our franchise's leadership with our partners around the world. 
We are continually investing in innovation, creativity and authenticity to bring EA SPORTS games closer to the heart of real world sports and fans. Engagement in Madden NFL 22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refresh franchise mode and Madden Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends. We've grown the F1 business year-over-year as F1 2021 from Codemasters continues to bring in more plans and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 title fights in years.
NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began, with a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. 
With a portfolio that now spans global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, golf, UFC fighting and racing, no other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams and partners as EA SPORTS. We have the unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate fan communities enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.
Expanding live services across our portfolio, particularly in mobile is our third growth driver for FY '22. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Golf Clash mobile game. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Golf Clash as a live service, and bringing the Clash Mechanic to more of our sports franchises, where our licenses and expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. 
Our EA Mobile teams also continued to drive success in live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players live to date in Q2. 
Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic and EA Mobile teams, we have built a powerful mobile-native organization within EA. This group is sharply focused on accelerating growth in our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services as well as introducing new experiences that take our powerful IP, including Battlefield into the expanding mobile audience. 
The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in, with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer managing company-wide operations, creative leaders joining our management team, and our new Chief Experience Officer leading our efforts to grow social ecosystems, all supporting our amazing teams as we drive growth into the next era of interactive entertainment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."

We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services, led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of Playdemic at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable mobile title and a blueprint for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever and more than double the level of last year's. We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year. 
EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle with engagement in its last couple of months up very significantly on FIFA 20. Keeping fans engaged drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double digits year-on-year based on the first 3 weeks of sales. 
Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collection events this quarter, but even so, the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life-to-date and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year. To launch an original IP and steadily build it into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional, and I'd like to recognize the Respawn team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of Season 11.
Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement or spend on our games as countries such as the U.K. emerge from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations.
So now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.848 billion and earnings per share of $2.03, up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. 
We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.625 billion. This is driven by outperformance so far this year, plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio. 
Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website. 
We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion. With capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.
As noted last quarter, CapEx is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environment and new offices around the globe. 
For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion. Cost of revenue to be $625 million and operating expenses of $1.1 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember, GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3. 
We expect Q3 financial 2022 net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted included last year the launch of FIFA 21 and was the largest quarter ever for Q3 in the company's history. The games in live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew."

And with respect to license negotiation, I would start by saying we have great relationships with all of our partners, all 300 of them, including FIFA. As we think about the future of football, we think the future is very bright. We think we are part of the very fabric of the culture of football globally, an important part of kind of fandom for football. And when we kind of interact with our hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities of play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football. 
They want more digital experiences outside the game, esports, NFTs broader sports consumption. And they want us to move really, really quickly. And so I would tell you, as we think about the future of football, we think it's very bright. We're going to work with our global collection of partners that we feel best enable us to do that. And we'll continue our conversation with each and every one of them to the extent that they're aligned with that objective."

We've got strong teams. We've got strong IP. We've got a huge network of players and we've got global reach. And we're already seeing the value of that when you think about our ability to kind of offer EA IP for our Glu Mobile folks or our Playdemic folks to start thinking about new and interesting experiences. 
I do think we've seen some softness in some of our games particularly those that rely a little bit more on user acquisition. I think that we'll work through that over time. Again, creative talent, great IP, huge network of players and global reach will allow us kind of work through that and find a path through that. But net-net, I think that there is a little IDFA, but nothing that has us concerned about our ability to continue to grow our mobile business over time."

And Doug, I would say, don't underestimate that in any -- I mean, we did 4 acquisitions in 1 year. There are always challenges to integration of acquisitions, and sometimes those challenges are we change plans inside the businesses. There are things that we may not have anticipated or fully understood. And so some of that is impacting. None of it is troublesome. None of it is long-term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration. It just happened also quickly. You can't plan exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.
We're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team, as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position. And I think, for us, the biggest opportunity is -- and this is an obvious one, and that is, how do we take our existing sports licenses and the talent that the Glus and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through their talent base and/or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us. 
Obviously, in FIFA but also in Madden and PGA in other areas where we can either augment their games, add to their games or add new games. And so that's why we're so excited about the acquisitions and not all that worried about any, any short-term softness in the business."

I think there was some conversation around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural in a beta. And we've been able to take that feedback around those constructive elements and really implement that in the game. And I think what we had talked about with the community is, it was an earlier build of the game that we used for the beta as the team continued to work and tune and polish the final build for the game. So we feel really good about that. 
I think when you think about the early access numbers and the engagement numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand. The game is very appealing. The setting is very appealing. The modalities of play, the innovation and creativity that [ dies ] and the other teams that work on that game have put into the game is something that the community is receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about.
I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday. I get that on a calendar basis, it looks the same as Battlefield V, I would tell you though, leading in the Battlefield V, we did not see the level of demand we are seeing now. We did not have the level of innovation in the game that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high fidelity game experience that we have now. 
And so net-net, coming out of the beta, we feel very good about player demand. And the team has been working very hard on tuning and polish and filing the game where we feel really good about the game that the community is going to get to play on day 1. 
And the team also has wonderful plans for the future live service that start with this notion of portal and really engaging our players deeply in the ability to kind of create their own Battlefield experiences. And so we feel very good and confident about the future of Battlefield at this stage."

We already know that many games have been postponed. And so the calendar is nowhere near as crowded, which means the need for discounting is nowhere near as high. .
Second is -- and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60-plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield skews even more to PCs, which means the download numbers is going to be even higher. And what that allows us to do is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from ability to sell through a lot of games as well as not have to discount those games dramatically."

And I would just note, Colin, the number of characters that are now in the game versus on day 1 are dramatically different. It just gives you a sense of how that game is continuing to evolve, not to mention the ways to play, the modalities, the maps and so forth. 
On the '23 question, I think you know this because we've been talking about this business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about '23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23, and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today is that optimism and excitement.
And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is now live services. And that comprises of things like Ultimate Team, Apex Mobile, The Sims, it is the special sauce of what we do. It is bring people together make sure that they're part of a social network and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged and what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry. 
We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time, basically, for mainly [ which is ]  the life of this company. And we've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time.
And when you then broaden that across The Sims and mobile titles and then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real live services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So we're very confident in growth for next year. Independent of any one pile because of that live service component of our business, and we're very excited about what that means going forward and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time."

I think about -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly in our sports games, again, it's different across different franchise. And so collectibility has different value over time. And collectability in games like FIFA and Madden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time? 
I think the short answer to that is, yes. I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players, and we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy, and you are seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending, they're getting that value. But we will continue as we have evolved the ultimate team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.
To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me, it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content. There were tools to more deeply engage the community. There's the aggregation and distribution of that content are migrated to audience. And there is the ecosystem born out of the engagement of that content but exists beyond the bounds of the traditional game experience. 
At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers starts with the games and the content that we create. And so for me, it was really saying to our creative leaders, ""I want to make sure that you are in a strategic conversation that's going to help us drive growth as a company."" I think it is a very central strand of DNA of who we are. 
They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next phase of growth of this company is going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors, but it will all start with that content. And as leaders of the teams that create that content, I felt it was important to have them in the conversation."

How do we think about that across platform? How do we think about the extension of those experiences? And business model is one piece of that puzzle. 
I think when we look at our Battlefield franchise today, we've acknowledged that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future. Job number one was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category. And I think that's what they have sought to do. And that's what they've achieved through this 128-player multiplayer giant expansion, more deep engagement in creativity through portal mode and innovative new modes in and around the game. I think the next phase of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield Mobile title. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in and of itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we then think about further expanding the play of those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now."

I think that Battlefield Premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out 12, 18, 24 months.

And so we did away with premium and we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service.
I feel good about what the team has planned now. I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend -- enhance their experience and engage in a way that makes sense for them but doesn't kind of bifurcate or trifurcate the community in anyway. So I think that this is a great community. I think a core community. I think the franchise is beloved amongst them.

Other than to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements with Ultimate Team, including one element, which is the preview packs, we've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall. And as we've kind of rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spend or a different type of spend on the Codemasters preview packs. And so what's clear to us is this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way through our growing player community to engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to kind of evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new few points of value for our players and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience.
The notion of could it evolve into other areas, I think the short answer is, absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the supplies in the light of the traditional supplies mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for a big part of the player base. And then there's another group of players that want to think differently about how they extend and enhance their experience. 
And you should expect that we'll take the learnings from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our mobile business and things like Apex Legends and kind of bring that back into our sports franchises. And so part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle and having 0.5 billion players in our network, engaging deepening experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio.

But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow is that we are doing that, and you'll see much more of that as the mobile build starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets where people have not played the game on console or PC because those aren't available to them. 
And so part of the markets that we're testing right now are those types of markets, where this is a new game for them. And so we're watching very closely as to how people play that and react to that. Do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example, of certain types of gameplay. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exists."

So I just, I think this is a growing player base in The Sims. I think the franchise continue to grow. And I would tell you, again, we had a lot to talk about other than The Sims today. We'll come back and share more in the future. But that team continues to think about how to grow their franchise even more than this day in a category and with a player base that is very different from the rest of our portfolio."

I think we're all raring to go to watch EA expand a FIFA audience to 2 billion plus given the footprint of football/soccer. So just I understand the do no harm for the newly acquired studios, but you have to be thinking about the multiple iterations of FIFA or I guess, EAFC as it might be known in the future.

Again, it's still relatively early for these integrations. And Playdemic is really, really early. But what I would tell you is, as we've thought about this, we really think about it across 3 vectors, right, which is the core creative teams and how to best get value there, and we have built a single mobile organization out of our EA Mobile team, Playdemic and Glu under Jeff Karp, who's an industry veteran but has more than a decade in mobile leadership and is really rethinking and building a strong forward-looking strategy around mobile for us.
The second element is IP. And when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle, tap sports, Baseball, Golf clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC, Hockey, The Sims. And so part of what Blake was doing about before as we start to think about the integration, we have gone through and we're working with those teams and say, okay, we're working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you could take that engine and apply to the FIFA business. the Tap Sports engine or the golf clash engine to football -- European football or American portfolio. And we're in that planning phase right now. And I would say the teams themselves are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises have global reach and global strength.
The third is just kind of our network of players and how we start to work across that. Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to take that advertising engine across our player network into our other products. We're already starting to see -- see that benefit? 
And then things like reach, we've already been able to launch TAP Sports Baseball into Japan. And so some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as a leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of mobile first talent, unbelievable portfolio of IP, a network of 0.5 billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the space of mobile."

I think there's -- we've had a lot of questions of the Respawn since it's a very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team has been very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have, in fact, staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in L.A. They've got another team in Vancouver that who can use to work on the game and grow and develop more content. 
I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community, and they are building for the long term. And so the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe. But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to their community and very thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time. And that will mean sometimes every 3 months, sometimes it will be longer and sometimes it will be shorter. But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment to continue to hire the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future.
So with that, we'll wrap up the call there. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and for the great questions. Be well, and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Bye-bye."

I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic, who are now officially part of our Electronic Arts team. We're thrilled to have them on board, adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. 
Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We are growing with our leading franchises, new launches and live services, all performing well during the quarter, and our acquisitions are driving additional growth beyond our core business.
With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we are connecting players all over the world to each other through more of their favorite content. As a result, net revenue, net bookings and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we are now raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year.
Our core strategy is built on 4 key opportunities: The creation of amazing games and content, tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, the aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22: expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports; and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today.
With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform reach, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield and The Sims are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment.
Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry, a brand-new IP that has scaled to more than 100 million players and is closing in on $1 billion in net bookings annually. Season 9 and Season 10 each respectively set new marks for the highest active players in Season 1, and Q2 was the biggest quarter of in-game spending in Apex that we've had to date.
Apex has grown beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than 130 million hours of Season 10 content watched to date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay, embedded in an immersive world of lore and characters that continues to expand. 
Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection events keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode. The Apex Legends esports ecosystem is growing as well, with the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now underway. Apex is moving from strength to strength, and we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year. 
Battlefield, another of our blockbuster properties, is beloved by tens of millions of fans. Ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2042 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 Open Beta in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had. Betas are an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small slice of the game in our Open Beta, we brought players into the full-scale 128-player combat and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped our teams with areas of the gameplay to polish and refine as we move towards launch.
We've now revealed all 3 of the games pillars: All-Out Warfare with 128-player multiplayer in Conquest and Breakthrough modes. Battlefield Portal, a new way to play that has the community very excited to create their own Battlefield experiences, and Hazard Zone with completely new squad-focused combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love. We're looking forward to players getting to all of these experiences when the full Battlefield 2042 launches from November 19.
Through FY '22, we continue to grow our leadership in sports through new games, acquisitions and new areas of expansion. Our global football or soccer, for us in the North America, franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world with approximately 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year.
EA SPORTS FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2, is off to the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation in our new HyperMotion technology revolutionized gameplay and is inspired, engaged and grown the community.
Total players are up 16% and new to franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch, with net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with Ultimate Team engagement up 15% year-over-year and more players coming into Volta and Career Modes.
There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including mobile, where later this fiscal year, we will bring new modes, new features and improved gameplay to FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience to date.
For nearly 30 years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world. Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport. With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license partners, including the Premier League, UEFA, CONMEBOL, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A, the MLS, FIFPro and many more and our expertise in growth areas including esports and mobile. EA SPORTS is ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world.
We have opportunities in new modalities of play and new social experiences that will bring up more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around their game. And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms, bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's leagues, teams and players.
We are more confident than ever about our bright future of football, and we will grow our franchise's leadership with our partners around the world.
We are continually investing in innovation, creativity and authenticity to bring EA SPORTS games closer to the heart of real world sports and fans. Engagement in Madden NFL 22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refresh franchise mode and Madden Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends. We've grown the F1 business year-over-year as F1 2021 from Codemasters continues to bring in more plans and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 title fights in years.
NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began, with a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. 
With a portfolio that now spans global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, golf, UFC fighting and racing, no other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams and partners as EA SPORTS. We have the unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate fan communities enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.
Expanding live services across our portfolio, particularly in mobile is our third growth driver for FY '22. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Golf Clash mobile game. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Golf Clash as a live service, and bringing the Clash Mechanic to more of our sports franchises, where our licenses and expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. 
Our EA Mobile teams also continued to drive success in live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players live to date in Q2. 
Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic and EA Mobile teams, we have built a powerful mobile-native organization within EA. This group is sharply focused on accelerating growth in our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services as well as introducing new experiences that take our powerful IP, including Battlefield into the expanding mobile audience. 
The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in, with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer managing company-wide operations, creative leaders joining our management team, and our new Chief Experience Officer leading our efforts to grow social ecosystems, all supporting our amazing teams as we drive growth into the next era of interactive entertainment. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Blake."
27963,715867527,2456042,"Electronic Arts Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Electronic Arts Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services, led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team.

We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services, led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of Playdemic at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable mobile title and a blueprint for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever and more than double the level of last year's. We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year.
EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle with engagement in its last couple of months up very significantly on FIFA 20. Keeping fans engaged drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double digits year-on-year based on the first 3 weeks of sales.
Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collection events this quarter, but even so, the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life-to-date and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year. To launch an original IP and steadily build it into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional, and I'd like to recognize the Respawn team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of Season 11.
Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement or spend on our games as countries such as the U.K. emerge from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations.
So now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.848 billion and earnings per share of $2.03, up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. 
We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.625 billion. This is driven by outperformance so far this year, plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio. 
Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website. 
We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion, with capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.
As noted last quarter, CapEx is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environment and new offices around the globe. 
For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion. Cost of revenue to be $625 million and operating expenses of $1.1 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember, GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3.
We expect Q3 financial 2022 net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted included last year the launch of FIFA 21 and was the largest quarter ever for Q3 in the company's history. The games in live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. 
Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew."

We have not put into our guidance virtually any revenue for either Apex Mobile or Battlefield Mobile this year. Apex Mobile is currently in test in multiple countries around the world. And we never quite know exactly when we're going to get out of test markets, but we're very pleased with the progress so far, which means we could bring it out earlier, but I would say that most of it is really focused on next year which we think is a positive since this year is so strong. It will continue to help next year. And I would put Battlefield in that same category."

The metrics that we're getting out of those games continues to be very strong. And so we continue to be confident about the opportunity around both of them.
And with respect to license negotiation, I would start by saying we have great relationships with all of our partners, all 300 of them, including FIFA. As we think about the future of football, we think the future is very bright. We think we are part of the very fabric of the culture of football globally, an important part of kind of fandom for football. And when we kind of interact with our hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities of play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football.
They want more digital experiences outside the game, esports, NFTs broader sports consumption. And they want us to move really, really quickly. And so I would tell you, as we think about the future of football, we think it's very bright. We're going to work with our global collection of partners that we feel best enable us to do that. And we'll continue our conversation with each and every one of them to the extent that they're aligned with that objective."

They add new modalities of play, so things like rank modes and arenas. They add new events that are important and kind of more deeply engage the community.
And so I think that as we think about live service on a go-forward basis, you should expect that thing to continue to be thoughtful and deliberate, they'll continue to build out modalities of play, they'll continue to create more content, but also really work with the community on community level events, which really drive the most engagement over time.

I feel good about our position with respect to that. I mean, as a company, we have been leaders in the creation of digital content that has real collectible value in the embedding of that content as part of live services. What we know about collection over time is the collectability is far more valuable to the collector where the collected item has utility.

None of it is long-term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration. It just happened also quickly. You can't plan exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.
We're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team, as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position. And I think, for us, the biggest opportunity is -- and this is an obvious one, and that is, how do we take our existing sports licenses and the talent that the Glus and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through their talent base and/or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us.
Obviously, in FIFA but also in Madden and PGA in other areas where we can either augment their games, add to their games or add new games. And so that's why we're so excited about the acquisitions and not all that worried about any, any short-term softness in the business."

I think there was some conversation around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural in a beta. And we've been able to take that feedback around those constructive elements and really implement that in the game. And I think what we had talked about with the community is, it was an earlier build of the game that we used for the beta as the team continued to work and tune and polish the final build for the game. So we feel really good about that.
I think when you think about the early access numbers and the engagement numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand. The game is very appealing. The setting is very appealing. The modalities of play, the innovation and creativity that guys and the other teams that work on that game have put into the game is something that the community is receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about.
I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday. I get that on a calendar basis, it looks the same as Battlefield V, I would tell you though, leading in the Battlefield V, we did not see the level of demand we are seeing now. We did not have the level of innovation in the game that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high fidelity game experience that we have now.
And so net-net, coming out of the beta, we feel very good about player demand. And the team has been working very hard on tuning and polishing and filing the game where we feel really good about the game that the community is going to get to play on day 1.
And the team also has wonderful plans for the future live service that start with this notion of portal and really engaging our players deeply in the ability to kind of create their own Battlefield experiences. And so we feel very good and confident about the future of Battlefield at this stage."

Second is -- and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60-plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield skews even more to PCs, which means the download numbers is going to be even higher. And what that allows us to do is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from ability to sell through a lot of games as well as not have to discount those games dramatically."

On the '23 question, I think you know this because we've been talking about this business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about '23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23, and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today is that optimism and excitement.
And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is now live services. And that comprises of things like Ultimate Team, Apex Mobile, The Sims, it is the special sauce of what we do. It is bring people together, make sure that they're part of a social network and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged and what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry.
We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time, basically, for -- mainly this is the life of this company. And we've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time.
And when you then broaden that across The Sims and mobile titles and then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real live services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So we're very confident in growth for next year independent of any one pile because of that live service component of our business, and we're very excited about what that means going forward and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time."

I think about -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly in our sports games, again, it's different across different franchise. And so collectability has different value over time. And collectability in games like FIFA and Madden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time?
I think the short answer to that is, yes. I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players, and we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy, and you are seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending, they're getting that value. But we will continue as we have evolved the ultimate team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.
To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me, it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content. There were tools to more deeply engage the community. There's the aggregation and distribution of that content migrated to audience. And there is the ecosystem born out of the engagement of that content but exists beyond the bounds of the traditional game experience.
At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers starts with the games and the content that we create. And so for me, it was really saying to our creative leaders, ""I want to make sure that you are in a strategic conversation that's going to help us drive growth as a company."" I think it is a very central strand of DNA of who we are.
They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next phase of growth of this company is going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors, but it will all start with that content. And as leaders of the teams that create that content, I felt it was important to have them in the conversation."

I think when we look at our Battlefield franchise today, we've acknowledged that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future. Job number one was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category. And I think that's what they have sought to do.

I think the next phase of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield Mobile title. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in and of itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we then think about further expanding the play of those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now."

I'm not sure the notion of not being engaged in cosmetic content. It's a fair assessment. I think that Battlefield Premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out 12, 18, 24 months. I think we saw deep engagements from the community in that. I think what we also saw though was we didn't get all of the community to engage deeply in that and some parts of the community want to engage in kind of a different profile. And so we did away with premium, and we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service.
I feel good about what the team has planned now. I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend -- enhance their experience and engage in a way that makes sense for them but doesn't kind of bifurcate or trifurcate the community in any way. So I think that this is a great community. I think they have a core community. I think the franchise is beloved amongst them. I think what we're seeing, even having been out of the market for 3 years, is demand and appeal continue to be incredibly high. And I'm excited about what we're going to launch with the game, but even more excited by the plans the team has the community to grow and expand that experience for global player base."

I don't have the specific metrics on payer conversion that I can share today. Other than to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements with Ultimate Team, including one element, which is the preview packs, we've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall.
And as we've kind of rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spend or a different type of spend on the Codemasters preview packs. And so what's clear to us is this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way through our growing player community to engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to kind of evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new few points of value for our players and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience.
The notion of could it evolve into other areas, I think the short answer is, absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the supplies in the light of the traditional supplies mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for a big part of the player base. And then there's another group of players that want to think differently about how they extend and enhance their experience.
And you should expect that we'll take the learnings from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our mobile business and things like Apex Legends and kind of bring that back into our sports franchises. And so part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle and having 0.5 billion players in our network, engaging deepening experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio. And we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise to franchise."

We continue to work on how and why Apex works in certain markets. And there are certain markets that it is unbelievable the strength of the franchise, where we haven't really done much other than localize the language. Japan is a great example of that. And so the team has been working hard, particularly on the mobile build of the game to be able to localize it more to how people want to play the game in those markets.
Now you want to be careful that you don't bifurcate the game in too many ways, but there may be some ways cosmetically or beyond language adjustments to make the game more powerful in those markets. And you should have seen that -- assume that's an ongoing process. It is hard to see and hard for us to carve that out as part of the financials. But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow is that we are doing that, and you'll see much more of that as the mobile build starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets where people have not played the game on console or PC because those aren't available to them.
And so part of the markets that we're testing right now are those types of markets, where this is a new game for them. And so we're watching very closely as to how people play that and react to that. Do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example, of certain types of gameplay. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exists."

Again, it's still relatively early for these integrations. And Playdemic is really, really early. But what I would tell you is, as we've thought about this, we really think about it across 3 vectors, right, which is the core creative teams and how to best get value there, and we have built a single mobile organization out of our EA Mobile team, Playdemic and Glu under Jeff Karp, who's an industry veteran that has more than a decade in mobile leadership and is really rethinking and building a strong forward-looking strategy around mobile for us.
The second element is IP. And when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle, tap sports, Baseball, Golf clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC, Hockey, The Sims. And so part of what Blake was doing about before as we start to think about the integration, we have gone through and we're working with those teams and say, okay, we're working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you could take that engine and apply to the FIFA business. The Tap Sports engine or the golf clash engine to football -- European football or American portfolio. And we're in that planning phase right now. And I would say the teams themselves are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises and have global reach and global strength.
The third is just kind of our network of players and how we start to work across that. Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to take that advertising engine across our player network into our other products. We're already starting to see -- see that benefit?
And then things like reach, we've already been able to launch Tap Sports Baseball into Japan. And so some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as a leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of mobile first talent, unbelievable portfolio of IP, a network of 0.5 billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the space of mobile."

I think there's -- we've had a lot of questions of the Respawn since it's a very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team has been very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have, in fact, staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in L.A. They've got another team in Vancouver that continues to work on the game and grow and develop more content.
I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community, and they are building for the long term. And so the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe.
But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to their community and very thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time. And that will mean sometimes it’s every 3 months, sometimes it will be longer and sometimes it will be shorter. But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment to continue to hire the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future.
