AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements in the quarter while year-over-year growth turned positive across several of our businesses. We also drove exceptional operating performance in the quarter, leveraging our broad set of operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to record backlog, margins and cash flow as well as the high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations, positioning us extremely well as we look ahead to 2021. 
The safety of our employees remains our #1 priority. We continue to adjust our practices and enforce our safety protocols across our businesses to help limit the possible spread of the virus. While we are cautious in the short term given COVID-19 and ongoing travel restrictions, we are highly confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver exceptional growth and shareholder returns over the long term. The AMETEK growth model continues to provide the framework for long-term sustainable success and our performance in 2020 was a testament to the strength and flexibility of the model. 
Now let me return to our results for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 8% with the divestiture of Reading Alloys, a 3 point headwind, the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 1 point to growth and foreign currency added 2 points. 
As we saw in prior quarters, our commercial aerospace business was the most impacted by the pandemic with sales down approximately 35% in the quarter. Orders continued to improve with our book-to-bill at 1.07 for the fourth quarter. This led to a record backlog of $1.8 billion, providing us with a positive line of sight into 2021. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $298.1 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2020, and operating margins were a record 24.9%, up an impressive 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. 
EBITDA in the fourth quarter was a record $360.7 million and EBITDA margins were also a record of 30.1%, up a robust 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019. This operating performance led to earnings per diluted share of $1.08, matching last year's fourth quarter results and comfortably ahead of our guidance for the quarter. 
Our business has also delivered outstanding cash flow during the quarter. With operating cash flow up 13% to a record $386 million and free cash flow conversion, exceptional 158% of net income. 
Now let me provide additional details at the operating group level for the fourth quarter. The Electronic Instruments group delivered superb operating performance despite challenging market conditions. EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $819.4 million down 7% from the prior year and in line with our expectations of solid sequential improvement. Organic sales were down 10% with the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 2% and foreign currency contributing 1%. 
Commercial aerospace remained the largest driver of the sales weakness while other EIG businesses saw improvements versus prior quarters. Our Materials Analysis division returned to growth in the fourth quarter, while other EIG businesses, including Zygo and Telular also generated year-over-year growth. Despite the overall sales decline, EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the prior year to a record $236 million, and operating margins reached a new high of 28.8%, expanding an exceptional 270 basis points over the same period in 2019. 
Our Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. EMG sales were $379.5 million down 11% from the fourth quarter in 2019, driven in large part by the divestiture of Reading Alloys. Organic sales were down 4% with the divestiture an 8-point headwind and foreign currency adding 2 points. In addition to continued strong growth across our defense businesses, we are pleased to see our automation business generate solid organic growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income for EMG was $79.8 million, and operating margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 21%. 
Now for the full year results. Despite very difficult end market conditions and meaningful top line headwinds in 2020, AMETEK was able to expand full year operating margins while delivering record levels of operating and free cash flow, truly outstanding performance. Overall sales for the year were $4.5 billion, down 12% from 2019. Organic sales declined 13% with acquisitions adding 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3% headwind and foreign currency flat for the year. Operating income in 2020 was $1.1 billion and operating margins were a record 23.6%, expanding 80 basis points over 2019. EBITDA for the year was $1.32 billion and EBITDA margins were a record  29.2% up 230 basis points from last year. This led to full year earnings of $3.95 per diluted share, down 6% versus the prior year. As Bill will highlight, our businesses did a fantastic job managing our working capital, which helped drive a record level of cash flow with full year operating cash flow up 15% to $1.28 billion. In summary, while 2020 was very challenging, I'm extremely proud of the way AMETEK colleagues managed through the pandemic and delivered tremendous results. 
Before I cover the outlook for 2021, I wanted to highlight certain key elements of the AMETEK growth model and how each position us for long-term success. First and foremost, AMETEK's proven operational acumen stood out in 2020 with our businesses doing an incredible job driving our operational excellence initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we generated $60 million in total cost savings with $50 million of structural savings and $10 million in temporary savings. And for the full year, total incremental savings versus the prior year were $235 million with approximately $145 million of structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings, including furloughs, travel reductions and temporary pay actions. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we expect a much more modest level of temporary savings versus 2020 as the economy continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic and we continue to add back these temporary costs. However, we do expect to drive meaningful incremental structural savings across our various operational excellence initiatives including across our global sourcing activities. For the full year 2021, we expect approximately $140 million of incremental operational excellence savings. 
Shifting to new product development. Even through this downturn, we remain committed to investing in new products and solutions that help our customers solve their most complex challenges. In 2020, we invested $246 million in research, development and engineering, approximately 5.5% of sales. These investments led to outstanding innovation and dozens of new product launches. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index or the percent of sales generated from products introduced over the last 3 years was an impressive 25%. In 2021, we expect to invest approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales in research, development and engineering to enhance our position as a global technology leader. This is a 10% increase over 2020 RD&E spend. 
Finally, I want to touch on our acquisition strategy. Prior to the onset of the pandemic last year, we acquired IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized, uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower has integrated nicely into our Power Systems and Instruments division and is performing well. While deal flow in 2020 was impacted by the pandemic, we are seeing continued improvements in the M&A markets and are managing a strong pipeline of acquisition targets across a broad set of markets. 
As Bill will discuss shortly, AMETEK has significant balance sheet capacity and, when combined with our robust cash flow generation, provides us with meaningful capital to support our acquisition strategy, which remains our #1 priority for capital development -- deployment. 
Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While we remain cautious in the short term, given the uncertainty of the timing and pace of the recovery, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. We continue to manage our businesses safely and prudently while ensuring continued investments in key growth initiatives. For the year, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single digits versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.30, up 6% to 9% compared to 2020. For the first quarter, we anticipate continued year-over-year impact from the pandemic, with overall sales down low to mid-single digits and first quarter earnings of $0.97 to $1.02 per share, flat to down 5% versus the prior year. 
In summary, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. I'm confident that we are emerging from this unprecedented economic environment even stronger than we were before. Again, I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and tremendous efforts as we manage the ongoing global crisis. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I would also like to thank and recognize all of my AMETEK colleagues for their so significant contributions in 2020. The way our teams persevered through the challenges of the past year was truly impressive. 
With that, I will provide additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year and will also provide some additional guidance for 2021. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $17.7 million, up modestly from the prior year. For the full year, G&A was down 11% from 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary cost reductions and, as a percentage of total sales, was 1.5% in both years. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately 10% due primarily to the return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.1%, up from 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The difference in tax rate was due primarily to the finalization of tax returns in each of the years. For 2021, assuming the current tax regime, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. Operating working capital was an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, down 330 basis points from the 17.3% reported in the same quarter last year, reflecting the outstanding work by our teams. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $110 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $65 million and for the full year was $255 million. In 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, including after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.50 per diluted share. 
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $386 million, up 13% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also a record at $349 million, up 16% over the same period last year, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 158% of net income. Cash flow for the full year also set new record levels. Operating cash flow for 2020 was $1.28 billion, up 15% over the prior year, and free cash flow was $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. Full year free cash flow conversion was 158% of net income adjusted for the Reading Alloys gain. Total debt at December 31 was $2.41 billion, down from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x at year-end. We entered 2021 with approximately $2.6 billion in liquidity to support our growth initiatives. This liquidity, along with our strong balance sheet and no material debt maturities until 2024, enables us to manage the continued effects of the economic downturn while also deploying meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. 
To conclude, our business has performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2021 and beyond remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?"

We're maintaining our discipline, but we're working on deals of all sizes. We have some larger deals we're working on. We have some AMETEK typical size deals, and we even have a couple of small technology acquisitions we're looking at. So I would say we've never been busier on M&A and we're looking at it the same way. We think deploying our capital on M&A is the best way to get our shareholders' return."

What happens to us usually in Q1 is that our process businesses are stronger in Q4 and not as strong in Q1. That's the seasonality. So you have a drop in revenue there. And then on the bottom line in Q1, along with the contribution margin effect of that, you have a lack of Reading and you also have a resetting some compensation G&A type costs. So you add that all together and our top line guide for Q1 is down low to mid-single digits. And we gave the earnings range of $0.97 to $1.02. So that's the way that we got that. And you also asked about the cadence, and I didn't answer that in the first part of your question. The cadence throughout the quarter, it was a pretty typical trend for us. Orders grew sequentially every month with December being the strongest month of the year and in fact, the strongest month of the quarter -- I mean as of 2020. And in terms of sales, we have a similar pattern with growing sequentially. December was strong and also the strongest month of the year. So that was good. And in January, orders and sales, they ended up at a level supportive over Q1 and our full year guide. I would characterize them as solid, so continuing the positive trend. 
When you think about the low to mid-single-digit guide, back in Q2, we had organic growth of about minus 22%, and that improved in Q3, and we believe it was minus 14%. And then you see the last quarter, Q4 completed was minus 8%. So to go from that minus 8% organic to a minus low to mid single digit organic, you see a continuing improvement. So we have a calendarization seasonality issue, but underlying it is a continuing sequential improvement of the business."

And when you take the organic growth combined with the OpEx structural savings, combined with the pricing, we're able to absorb the temporary costs coming back to the P&L and end up with incremental margin of about 35%. Now typically, AMETEK would have a bit higher incremental margin, but the 35% is a solid number and it includes absorbing all the temporary costs. So we feel comfortable with the margin forecast that we have for 2021. We think core operating margins will be up about 40 basis points, and we believe the incremental margins will be up about 35%."

And China, in particular, grew 22% with us with -- in the quarter. So really big pickup there, both Process and automation. And as we talked about prior quarters, automation picking up, the Process business followed, and that had a big impact on EIG margins, as you can see in the accounts. When you think about the U.S., we were down low double digits on broad-based weakness other than the defense market. The defense market was strong. And when you think about Europe, we were down mid-teens on broad-based weakness other than the automation business. So in the U.S. and in Europe, it was down except for small parts of our portfolio that were bright spots. But in China, we really knocked it out of park. In Asia, we did well. What we're thinking, the incremental improvements in 2021 are going to continue in Europe and the U.S. So the sequential improvements that we've been seeing are going to continue. And we think that Asia, for our quotation activity, Asia is going to maintain strength.

We are seeing transportation costs but we got them under control. We have very good supply chain people, and we've got that factored in. And with our highly differentiated portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets, when we have those kind of costs, we're typically able to pass them on to the customer.

We needed to get some expertise from different regions to the emerging markets. We couldn't travel, and so we delayed them. So we spent $74 million in 2020, and our original plan was $102 million. So we ended up spending a little less than 2% in 2020. In 2021, we're going to spend a little over 2%. We're going to make up a bit of those projects because they're still there, and there's great opportunity in other areas. But we're still, longer term, 2% of sales is the CapEx number, and we have a little bit of makeup this year with projects that -- these efficiency projects and growth projects have very high internal rates of returns or rates of returns like 30%, 40%, 50%. So this is the kind of stuff that you want to fund, you want to get done, and we have a whole slew of projects that we're getting after."

So there's smaller deals but the size growing with the size of the company. We're a bigger company now. So like I said, there's technology deals we're looking at that will augment our organic growth. There's deals in our sweet spot, very close to our existing positions that we'll get a very high-return on capital on. And there are some bigger deals that fit with us but are in adjacent markets.

The first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses is definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now.

The first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses is definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now. And the team has done an excellent job of realigning the cost structure, lower volume but still very profitable and more profitable than the average AMETEK business. So we think any change in volume is going to result in high contribution margins because we so leaned out the cost structure. The second point is there's a distinctly different demand pattern that we've been talking about all along. About half of our business in aerospace and defense is in the military space. That business was up mid-teens in the fourth quarter. We think we still see growth in 2021, but it will be more mid-single digits. And in the commercial space, that business was down about 35% in the fourth quarter, down about 30% for the entire full year. And for 2021, the commercial aerospace business we're seeing is flat to up low single digits. And the commercial aerospace business is impacted by many variables impacting demand, including government support, airline capacity decisions. And overriding it all is the confidence of the flying public, and it's very difficult to predict that thing and -- to predict those things when they the pandemic is raging. So we're pretty conservative how we're looking in that. The management team we have in aerospace is outstanding. And eventually, the commercial business is going to come back. I don't think it's going to be 2021. I think it's going to be beyond that, and our guidance reflects that. So we're really -- we've really done a hard work and done the right thing in our aerospace business. So we're poised even for small incremental sales growth to deliver good margins. And eventually, that long-cycle business will pick up and drive the earnings of the company."

AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements",1552,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. 
AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements in the quarter while year-over-year growth turned positive across several of our businesses. We also drove exceptional operating performance in the quarter, leveraging our broad set of operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to record backlog, margins and cash flow as well as the high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations, positioning us extremely well as we look ahead to 2021. 
The safety of our employees remains our #1 priority. We continue to adjust our practices and enforce our safety protocols across our businesses to help limit the possible spread of the virus. While we are cautious in the short term given COVID-19 and ongoing travel restrictions, we are highly confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver exceptional growth and shareholder returns over the long term. The AMETEK growth model continues to provide the framework for long-term sustainable success and our performance in 2020 was a testament to the strength and flexibility of the model. 
Now let me return to our results for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 8% with the divestiture of Reading Alloys, a 3 point headwind, the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 1 point to growth and foreign currency added 2 points. 
As we saw in prior quarters, our commercial aerospace business was the most impacted by the pandemic with sales down approximately 35% in the quarter. Orders continued to improve with our book-to-bill at 1.07 for the fourth quarter. This led to a record backlog of $1.8 billion, providing us with a positive line of sight into 2021. 
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $298.1 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2020, and operating margins were a record 24.9%, up an impressive 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. 
EBITDA in the fourth quarter was a record $360.7 million and EBITDA margins were also a record of 30.1%, up a robust 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019. This operating performance led to earnings per diluted share of $1.08, matching last year's fourth quarter results and comfortably ahead of our guidance for the quarter. 
Our business has also delivered outstanding cash flow during the quarter. With operating cash flow up 13% to a record $386 million and free cash flow conversion, exceptional 158% of net income. 
Now let me provide additional details at the operating group level for the fourth quarter. The Electronic Instruments group delivered superb operating performance despite challenging market conditions. EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $819.4 million, down 7% from the prior year and in line with our expectations of solid sequential improvement. Organic sales were down 10%, with the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 2%, and foreign currency contributing 1%. 
Commercial aerospace remained the largest driver of the sales weakness while other EIG businesses saw improvements versus prior quarters. Our Materials Analysis division returned to growth in the fourth quarter, while other EIG businesses, including Zygo and Telular, also generated year-over-year growth. 
Despite the overall sales decline, EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the prior year to a record $236 million, and operating margins reached a new high of 28.8%, expanding an exceptional 270 basis points over the same period in 2019. 
Our Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. EMG sales were $379.5 million, down 11% from the fourth quarter in 2019, driven in large part by the divestiture of Reading Alloys. Organic sales were down 4%, with the divestiture an 8-point headwind, and foreign currency adding 2 points. In addition to continued strong growth across our defense businesses, we are pleased to see our automation business generate solid organic growth in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter operating income for EMG was $79.8 million, and operating margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 21%. 
Now for the full year results. Despite very difficult end market conditions and meaningful top line headwinds in 2020, AMETEK was able to expand full year operating margins while delivering record levels of operating and free cash flow, truly outstanding performance. 
Overall sales for the year were $4.5 billion, down 12% from 2019. Organic sales declined 13%, with acquisitions adding 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3% headwind, and foreign currency flat for the year. Operating income in 2020 was $1.1 billion and operating margins were a record 23.6%, expanding 80 basis points over 2019. 
EBITDA for the year was $1.32 billion and EBITDA margins were a record 29.2%, up 230 basis points from last year. This led to full year earnings of $3.95 per diluted share, down 6% versus the prior year. 
As Bill will highlight, our businesses did a fantastic job managing our working capital, which helped drive a record level of cash flow with full year operating cash flow up 15% to $1.28 billion. 
In summary, while 2020 was very challenging, I'm extremely proud of the way AMETEK colleagues managed through the pandemic and delivered tremendous results. 
Before I cover the outlook for 2021, I wanted to highlight certain key elements of the AMETEK growth model and how each position us for long-term success. 
First and foremost, AMETEK's proven operational acumen stood out in 2020, with our businesses doing an incredible job driving our operational excellence initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we generated $60 million in total cost savings with $50 million of structural savings and $10 million in temporary savings. And for the full year, total incremental savings versus the prior year were $235 million, with approximately $145 million of structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings, including furloughs, travel reductions and temporary pay actions. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we expect a much more modest level of temporary savings versus 2020 as the economy continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic and we continue to add back these temporary costs. However, we do expect to drive meaningful incremental structural savings across our various operational excellence initiatives including across our global sourcing activities. For the full year 2021, we expect approximately $140 million of incremental operational excellence savings. 
Shifting to new product development. Even through this downturn, we remain committed to investing in new products and solutions that help our customers solve their most complex challenges. In 2020, we invested $246 million in research, development and engineering, approximately 5.5% of sales. These investments led to outstanding innovation and dozens of new product launches. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index or the percent of sales generated from products introduced over the last 3 years was an impressive 25%. In 2021, we expect to invest approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales in research, development and engineering to enhance our position as a global technology leader. This is a 10% increase over 2020 RD&E spend. 
Finally, I want to touch on our acquisition strategy. Prior to the onset of the pandemic last year, we acquired IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized, uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower has integrated nicely into our Power Systems and Instruments division and is performing well. While deal flow in 2020 was impacted by the pandemic, we are seeing continued improvements in the M&A markets and are managing a strong pipeline of acquisition targets across a broad set of markets. 
As Bill will discuss shortly, AMETEK has significant balance sheet capacity and, when combined with our robust cash flow generation, provides us with meaningful capital to support our acquisition strategy, which remains our #1 priority for capital development -- deployment. 
Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While we remain cautious in the short term, given the uncertainty of the timing and pace of the recovery, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. We continue to manage our businesses safely and prudently while ensuring continued investments in key growth initiatives. 
For the year, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single digits versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.30, up 6% to 9% compared to 2020. For the first quarter, we anticipate continued year-over-year impact from the pandemic, with overall sales down low to mid-single digits and first quarter earnings of $0.97 to $1.02 per share, flat to down 5% versus the prior year. 
In summary, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. I'm confident that we are emerging from this unprecedented economic environment even stronger than we were before. Again, I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and tremendous efforts as we manage the ongoing global crisis. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"
31860,701175807,2192247,"AMETEK, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","AMETEK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter.

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I would also like to thank and recognize all of my AMETEK colleagues for their so significant contributions in 2020. The way our teams persevered through the challenges of the past year was truly impressive. 
With that, I will provide additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year and will also provide some additional guidance for 2021. 
Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $17.7 million, up modestly from the prior year. For the full year, G&A was down 11% from 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary cost reductions and, as a percentage of total sales, was 1.5% in both years. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately 10% due primarily to the return of temporary costs, including compensation. 
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.1%, up from 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The difference in tax rate was due primarily to the finalization of tax returns in each of the years. For 2021, assuming the current tax regime, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. Operating working capital was an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, down 330 basis points from the 17.3% reported in the same quarter last year, reflecting the outstanding work by our teams. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $110 million. 
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $65 million and for the full year was $255 million. In 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.50 per diluted share. 
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $386 million, up 13% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also a record at $349 million, up 16% over the same period last year, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 158% of net income. Cash flow for the full year also set new record levels. Operating cash flow for 2020 was $1.28 billion, up 15% over the prior year, and free cash flow was $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. Full year free cash flow conversion was 158% of net income adjusted for the Reading Alloys gain. 
Total debt at December 31 was $2.41 billion, down from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x at year-end. 
We entered 2021 with approximately $2.6 billion in liquidity to support our growth initiatives. This liquidity, along with our strong balance sheet and no material debt maturities until 2024, enables us to manage the continued effects of the economic downturn while also deploying meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. 
To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2021 and beyond remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?"

We have some AMETEK typical-sized deals, and we even have a couple of small technology acquisitions we're looking at.

We sat back and -- near the end of the year and into January, there were situations that occur where you're having to close down your plant for a couple of days, get everyone tested, clean it.

But as we thought through it and we were executing well -- so well, that we got confident that we're able to operate and execute with the virus, and we have good processes and protocols in place. And we're seeing the -- we're mid-cycle and long-cycle businesses, and we're seeing those demand picks up -- pick up later in the year, we're assuming, and that all went into discussion. We talked about it several times. But we feel comfortable with the guidance that we're giving, and we feel comfortable we're going to be able to execute, and we feel the processes and procedures we've developed are allowing us to operate safely, and we also feel -- we're feeling an uptick.

What happens to us usually in Q1 is that our Process businesses are stronger in Q4 and not as strong in Q1. That's the seasonality. So you have a drop in revenue there. And then on the bottom line in Q1, along with the contribution margin effect of that, you have a lack of Reading and you also have us resetting some compensation G&A-type costs. 
So you add that all together and our top line guide for Q1 is down low to mid-single digits. And we gave the earnings range of $0.97 to $1.02. So that's the way that we got that. 
And you also asked about the cadence, and I didn't answer that in the first part of your question. The cadence throughout the quarter, it was a pretty typical trend for us. Orders grew sequentially every month with December being the strongest month of the year and in fact, the strongest month of the quarter -- I mean, of 2020. 
And in terms of sales, we have a similar pattern with growing sequentially. December was strong and also the strongest month of the year. So that was good. And in January, orders and sales, they ended up at a level supportive over Q1 and our full year guide. I would characterize them as solid. So continuing the positive trend. 
When you think about the low to mid-single-digit guide, back in Q2, we had organic growth of about minus 22%, and that improved in Q3, and we believe it was minus 14%. And then you see the last quarter, Q4 completed was minus 8%. So to go from that minus 8% organic to a minus low to mid-single digit organic, you see a continuing improvement. So we have a calendarization seasonality issue, but underlying it is a continuing sequential improvement of the business."

On top of that, we have continued stronger pricing. And when you take the organic growth combined with the OpEx structural savings, combined with the pricing, we're able to absorb the temporary costs coming back to the P&L and end up with incremental margin of about 35%. 
Now typically, AMETEK would have a bit higher incremental margin, but the 35% is a solid number and it includes absorbing all the temporary costs. So we feel comfortable with the margin forecast that we have for 2021. We think core operating margins will be up about 40 basis points, and we believe the incremental margins will be up about 35%."

Good question. Yes, I'll start with Q4. In Q4, there are really mixed trends across geographies and -- with Asia returning to strong growth and Europe and the U.S. seeing continued sequential improvements but still showing negative organic growth. 
And let me talk about Asia first. We had a great quarter in Asia. We were up low double digits, and we had strong growth in both our Process and Automation businesses. And China, in particular, grew 22% with us with -- in the quarter. So really big pickup there, both Process and Automation. And as we talked about prior quarters, Automation picking up, the Process business followed, and that had a big impact on EIG margins, as you can see in the accounts. 
When you think about the U.S., we were down low double digits on broad-based weakness other than the defense market. The defense market was strong. And when you think about Europe, we were down mid-teens on broad-based weakness other than the Automation business. 
So in the U.S. and in Europe, it was down except for small parts of our portfolio that were bright spots. But in China, we really knocked it out of park. In Asia, we did well. What we're thinking, the incremental improvements in 2021 are going to continue in Europe and the U.S. So the sequential improvements that we've been seeing are going to continue. And we think that Asia, for our quotation activity, Asia is going to maintain strength. So I'm not sure we're going to go up 22% in China, but -- every quarter, but certainly, we're seeing strength in the pipeline in China and broader Asia."

There's $80 million of OpEx savings in that. So remember, we have a spillover from 2020, but there's ongoing programs.

And for 2021, we see slightly higher pricing than 1.5%, but we're going to have slightly higher inflation. So think about it as a 50 basis point spread, a little higher price, a little higher inflation. And we are seeing commodity price inflation. We are seeing transportation costs but we got them under control. We have very good supply chain people, and we've got that factored in. And with our highly differentiated portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets, when we have those kind of costs, we're typically able to pass them on to the customer. And I've been very pleased to see our pricing out of wealth of the pandemic. 
In terms of material shortages, I mean, there's a little bit of -- there are issues in the semiconductor market that have been in the press, where you see the automotive industry having some issues now and our supply chain people are on top of that and working it. But it hasn't caused us any missed shipments or anything like that. So it's just something to manage, and it's an issue we're working on."

The first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses, it's definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now. And the team has done an excellent job of realigning the cost structure, lower volume but still very profitable and more profitable than the average AMETEK business. So we think any change in volume is going to result in high contribution margins because we so leaned out the cost structure. 
The second point is there's a distinctly different demand pattern that we've been talking about all along. About half of our business in aerospace and defense is in the military space. That business was up mid teens in the fourth quarter. We think we still see growth in 2021, but it will be more mid-single digits. And in the commercial space, that business was down about 35% in the fourth quarter, down about 30% for the entire full year. And for 2021, the commercial aerospace business we're seeing is flat to up low single digits. And the commercial aerospace business is impacted by many variables impacting demand, including government support, airline capacity decisions. And overriding it all is the confidence of the flying public, and it's very difficult to predict that thing and -- to predict those things when they the pandemic is raging. So we're pretty conservative how we're looking in that. The management team we have in aerospace is outstanding. 
And eventually, the commercial business is going to come back. I don't think it's going to be 2021. I think it's going to be beyond that, and our guidance reflects that. So we're really -- we've really done a hard work and done the right thing in our aerospace business. So we're poised even for small incremental sales growth to deliver good margins. And eventually, that long-cycle business will pick up and drive the earnings of the company."

AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales",1655,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected, and as the economy continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog. 
Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on 5 acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance. 
Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we managed through the pandemic. AMETEK's success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented employees across the company. While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout, we remain focused on the health and well-being of our employees and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring proper safety protocols are being followed. 
Now let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2-point foreign currency tailwind. Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year, with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book-to-bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion. We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer-cycle businesses have yet to return to growth. 
Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02. 
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income. 
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. 
EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. 
EMG's first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5-point headwind and foreign currency was a 2-point tailwind. EMG's operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year, and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%. 
Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of M&A in 2021. At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. 
These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire 5 excellent businesses thus far this year. 
Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK's largest ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Hosi, Alabama, Abaco is a leading provider of mission-critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along with specialized industrial applications. Abaco's open architecture computing and electronic systems are ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand horse conditions, including extreme temperatures, altitude and high vibration. 
As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive high-growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense platform. Abaco has approximately $325 million in annual sales and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition. 
Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is a leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol's outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses form an industry-leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions. Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition. 
Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radio frequency and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting addition to our test and measurement platform given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave technologies. Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high-growth applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition. 
In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired 2 smaller get highly strategic businesses in Frank Software and EGS Automation. Frank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada as a provider of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Frank's award-winning storyboard software platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart, digitally enabled devices. 
And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunkers, German headquarters, EGS designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and beverage and general industrial markets. 
We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Frank Software and EGS teams in AMETEK, and we look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined, these acquisitions add approximately $535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates. 
Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership. AMETEK's decentralized operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the businesses while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions. We are still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy. 
In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately $95 million in incremental growth investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy. 
Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend. 
Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we have increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. 
For 2021, we now expect overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis, while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis. versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.46, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share. 
For the second quarter, Overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year's second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the 5 completed acquisitions. 
To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model along with the resilience of our world-class workforce. With our differentiated technology solutions, serving a diverse set of niche end markets, aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. 
I will now turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results, highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
First quarter, general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs including compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% recorded in the same period last year. 
For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to do an outstanding job managing our working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020. Just excellent work by our teams on the working capital front. 
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share. 
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively. Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x. 
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisition of Magnetrol, Frank Software and EGS Automation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in $1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year. 
Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a 5-year delayed draw bank term loan for up to $800 million, with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent acquisition activities and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy. 
Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and net -- our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high-quality results that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021 given our strong balance sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin?"

We've managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And it was no surprise in this particular downturn, the deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020 and pent-up demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we'll be well positioned as we strengthened our balance sheet and we build up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we exit the year with $1.2 billion in cash and a net debt to EBITDA of $0.9 million. 
But as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we told you that our -- last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated, we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first 4 months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people that are working for them. So we acquired 5 companies, deployed $1.85 billion in capital, and they're highly strategic and we're really excited for each of the companies we acquired. 
They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth areas like embedded systems for aerospace and defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G satellite communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in the automation business, software for embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired. 
And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We developed a custom playbook for each of the businesses, and they're going to benefit from our global footprint to help them accelerate the efficiencies. Importantly, for us, we were able to get the deals done. We're meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%. So these are important thresholds for us, and we want to ensure that we're providing strong level of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders. 
And one of the benefits of AMETEK's distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of acquisitions like this, to acquire and integrate multiple businesses while remaining active in acquiring other businesses. There's a -- these are coming into different parts of AMETEK and there's a senior AMETEK leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remain strong, and we have a meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow. 
So I hope we're talking to you before the end of the year about some other things. But we feel real good about it. And it wasn't just it all happened once. It's a lot of our work over the course of the pandemic and of course, greater than a year."

But there's still many businesses that are, I'll call it, medium sized that are the $100 million deal. Similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol, probably the most businesses of that size. And then we also have some smaller deals that are really important strategically to augment our internal growth. 
So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. I mean AMETEK is not going to buy a company our size or buy a company half our size, we don't -- we just don't think that he can create value like that. But the size of the company now, I think those companies in the $200 million to $400 million revenue makes sense, and you'll see those from us occasionally."

When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid-single digits to high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will grow sales sequentially each quarter. 
And when you look at our 4 market segments, Process improved high single digits, Power and Industrial improved to high single digits, Automation and Engineering improved high single digits, but the Aerospace and Defense segment, we continue to expect low to mid-single digits. So Defense -- with Defense doing better than Commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is doing well. And I'd carve out the 2 long-cycle businesses, oil and gas we think will trend up in the second half of this year and the commercial aerospace business, which will not trend up until 2023, maybe 2022, 2023. 
But the key point is we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive. We're going to have the long-cycle businesses kicking down the road, and we're already seeing the mid-cycle pick up.

And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points. 
So we'll grow margins. A key point, though, is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin than AMETEK, and over the course of a couple of years, 3 years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level. And It's pretty hard to acquire businesses that are at the profitability level of AMETEK. We're at the 29%, 30% EBITDA, so -- and we have some room with all these businesses to improve profitability.

And we're managing this with our dedicated business unit supply chain personnel with an overlay of our company-wide global sourcing. And they're an effective team, and we've done an effective job on it so far. But it is a serious issue. Our guidance reflects the known risk, and we're confident we can deliver. But it really -- we just felt it was too early in the year to improve the second half earnings and sales guidance because of that. We think it's a nice balance."

It was up mid-single digits in the quarter, and returned to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. A little extra color there, alteration precision technologies in our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters, and they're seeing improving demand across a broad set of end markets. They're in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets. 
We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our process businesses, organic quarters were up low double digits, so a little bit higher than AMETEK's overall. And for the full year, we now expect those organic sales for our Process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid-single digits in the original guide for the year, and we raised it to high single digits. So Process orders look good. Process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders. 
In our Aerospace and Defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first quarter. modestly ahead of our expectation. And really, there's a bifurcation going on there. The defense businesses remain robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial aerospace are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. The year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to improve, but in the first quarter, Commercial Aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all of '21, we -- like I said before, we haven't -- we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth from our Aerospace and Defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did the other 3. 
Power & Industrial, overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders up mid-teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our Power and Industrial businesses to be up high single digits, and we changed that from up mid-single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, where organic sales were up mid-single digits. 
Overall sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales across our Automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks remain strong and we're seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets in Asia and China, in particular. And for all of 2021, we now expect automation and Engineered Solutions businesses organic sales growth to be up high single digits with stronger growth in our Automation businesses than our Engineered Solutions business. And that's -- you end up with both EIG and EMG being up high single-digits rate for mid-single digits."

I mean the first thing, Defense is about 12% of the sales of AMETEK. And when we looked at Abaco, we wanted to make sure that -- we have a changing administration, we wanted to make sure we were be able to grow through this. And if you look back at Abaco over the last 3 or 4 years, they grew about 16%. And that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. It's -- we feel that embedded computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing intensive and data-intensive mission capabilities in the future. 
We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But we -- at the same time, we think they're well positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds because of those factors. And we modeled our top line as a high single-digit grower versus the mid-teens in the recent past. So We think we've got a conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth rates, but we modeled it conservatively. 
And when you look at AMETEK's broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the right areas. We -- there's a lot of electronics going in, and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms of the environmental controls and It's been doing well for us. And we think this year, for 2021, outside of Abaco, our core business will be up mid- to high single digits in the defense market.

AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales",1655,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected, and as the economy continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.  
Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on 5 acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.  
Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we managed through the pandemic. AMETEK's success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented employees across the company. While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout, we remain focused on the health and well-being of our employees, and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring proper safety protocols are being followed.  
Now let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with the divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2-point foreign currency tailwind. Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year, with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book-to-bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion. We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer-cycle businesses have yet to return to growth.  
Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02. 
Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.  
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. EMG's first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5-point headwind and foreign currency was a 2-point tailwind. EMG's operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year, and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.  
Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of M&A in 2021. At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire 5 excellent businesses thus far this year.  
Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK's largest ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, Abaco is a leading provider of mission-critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along with specialized industrial applications. Abaco's open architecture computing and electronic systems are ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures, altitude and high vibration. As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive high-growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense platform. Abaco has approximately $325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition.  
Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is a leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol is outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses form an industry-leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions. Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.  
Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radiofrequency and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting addition to our test and measurement platform given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave technologies. Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high-growth applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.  
In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired 2 smaller, yet highly strategic businesses in Crank Software and EGS Automation. Crank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, is a provider of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Crank's award-winning Storyboard software platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart, digitally enabled devices.  
And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunker's German headquarters, EGS designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and beverage and general industrial markets.  
We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Crank Software and EGS teams to AMETEK, and we look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined, these acquisitions add approximately $535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates. Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership. AMETEK's decentralized operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the businesses while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions.  
We are still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy.  
In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately $95 million in incremental growth investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy.  
Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.  
Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we have increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. For 2021, we now expect overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis, while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.  
For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year's second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the 5 completed acquisitions.  
To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model along with the resilience of our world-class workforce. With our differentiated technology solutions, serving a diverse set of niche end markets aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  
I will now turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results, highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial highlights for the quarter.  
First quarter general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to the higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation. 
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% recorded in the same period last year. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to do an outstanding job managing our working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020, just excellent work by our teams on the working capital front.  
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share.  
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively. Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.  
Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.  
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisition of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in $1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.  
Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a 5-year, delayed draw bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent acquisition activities and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy.  
Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and net -- our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.  
To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high-quality results that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021 given our strong balance sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin?"

We've managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And it was no surprise in this particular downturn, the deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020 and pent-up demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we'll be well positioned is we strengthen our balance sheet and we build up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we exited the year with $1.2 billion in cash and a net debt to EBITDA of 0.9x. 
Look, as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we told you that our -- last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated, we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first 4 months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people that are working for them. 
So we acquired 5 companies, deployed $1.85 billion in capital, and they're highly strategic, and we're really excited for each of the companies we acquired. They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth areas like embedded systems for Aerospace & Defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G, satellite communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in the Automation business, software for embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired. 
And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We developed a custom playbook for each of the businesses, and they're going to benefit from our global footprint to help them accelerate the efficiencies. Importantly, for us, we were able to get the deals done. We're meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%. So these are important thresholds for us, and we want to ensure that we're providing level -- strong level of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders. 
And one of the benefits of AMETEK's distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of acquisitions like this, to acquire and integrate multiple businesses while remaining active in acquiring other businesses. There's a -- these are coming into different parts of AMETEK, and there's a senior AMETEK leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remains strong, and we have a meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow. 
So I hope we're talking to you before the end of the year about some other things. But we feel real good about it. And it wasn't just it all happened at once, it's a lot of hard work over the course of the pandemic and the course of greater than a year."

A few years ago, we let our investors know that we are expanding our deal pipeline to include slightly bigger businesses.

But there's still many businesses that are, I'll call it, medium sized that are the $100 million deals, similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol, probably most businesses of that size. And then we also have some smaller deals that are really important strategically to augment our internal growth. 
So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. I mean AMETEK is not going to buy a company our size or buy a company half our size. We don't -- just don't think that you can create value like that.

When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid-single digits to high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will grow sales sequentially each quarter. 
And when you look at our 4 market segments, Process improved high single digits, Power & Industrial improved high single digits, Automation & Engineering improved high single digits, but the Aerospace & Defense segment, we continued to expect low to mid-single digits. So defense -- with defense doing better than commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is doing well. And I'd carve out the 2 long-cycle businesses. Oil and gas that, we think, will trend up in the second half of this year and the commercial aerospace business, which will not trend up until 2023 maybe, 2022, 2023. 
But the key point is we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive. We're going to have the long-cycle businesses kicking down the road, and we're already seeing the mid-cycle pick up.

And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points. 
So we'll grow margins. A key point, though, is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin than AMETEK, and over the course of a couple of years, 3 years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level.

It was up mid-single digits in the quarter, and returned to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. Our -- a little extra color there. Ultra Precision Technologies and our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters, and they're seeing improving demand across a broad set of end markets. They're in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets. 
We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our Process businesses. Organic quarters were up low double digits, so a little bit higher than AMETEK's overall. And for the full year, we now expect those organic sales for our Process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid-single digits in the original guide for the year, and we raised it to high single digits. So Process orders look good. Process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders. 
In our Aerospace & Defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first quarter, modestly ahead of our expectation. And really, there's a bifurcation going on there. The Defense businesses remain robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial Aerospace are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. The year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to improve, but in the first quarter, Commercial Aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all of '21, we -- like I said before, we haven't -- we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth from our Aerospace & Defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did the other 3. 
Power & Industrial, overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders, up mid-teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses to be up high single digits, and we changed that from up mid-single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, where our organic sales were up mid-single digits. 
Overall sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales across our Automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, remain strong, and we're seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets in Asia, and China, in particular. And for all of 2021, we now expect Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses organic sales growth to be up high single digits with stronger growth in our Automation businesses than our Engineered Solutions business. And that's -- you end up with both EIG and EMG being up high single-digits rates from mid-single digits."

And if you look back at Abaco over the last 3 or 4 years, they grew about 16%. And that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. It's -- we feel that embedded computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing-intensive and data-intensive mission capabilities in the future. 
We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But we -- at the same time, we think they're well positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds because of those factors. And we modeled our top line as a high single-digit grower versus the mid-teens in the recent past. So we think we've got a conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth rates, but we modeled it conservatively. 
And when you look at AMETEK's broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the right areas. We -- there's a lot of electronics going in, and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms of the environmental controls, and it's been doing well for us. And we think this year, for 2021, outside of Abaco, our core business will be up mid- to high single digits in the defense market.

We established record lev",1152,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams. 
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile. The 5 acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%. Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added 2 points. 
Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year. 
Our businesses also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results. 
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020. And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%. 
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10. 
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% in net income. 
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter. Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. 
[Audio Gap]
Margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus the prior year to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added 3 points to the quarter. 
Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 33% compared to the prior year period. And EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to a record 24.9%. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well. And the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected. 
AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications. 
In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E. And for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. 
For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth. 
As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary cost into our cost structure. While we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price, given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread. 
Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings. 
Now moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. 
For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter. 
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb, with excellent sales and orders growth and high-quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance through the first half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model. 
Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. 
[Audio Gap]
compensation costs. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change, the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. 
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020. 
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share. 
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash, given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow was $264 million with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. 
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on 5 strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021. 
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9x and 1.6x, respectively. We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy, given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.

So that's -- I think the cycle is kind of falling along we think where our automation businesses would kind of lead us in. And then we have the Process and Power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or 2, we have our commercial aerospace business. So the cycle is kind of following what we think. 
It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issues and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing, but I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last 5 years, and we're well positioned to benefit from that investment.

So again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand as people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing if you go through our portfolio, look, let's start with our Process businesses, what's our largest business. It grew 20 -- mid-20s organic during the quarter, really a strong level of demand essentially all in margin, leading to really robust sales and orders. 
Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our Ultra Precision Technology business that had a great quarter, and they're benefiting from metrology measurement technology related to automation. And you think about the Power & Industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments, Power & Industrial, and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our IntelliPower business. 
Again, that was broad-based. And the Power & Industrial business was kind of one of the laggers on orders to pick up. And we're really pleased to see that. 
And then we talked about our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. They were up low 20s organic, and that's been strong for a period of time with robust and strong demand continuing. So all of those are strong. 
The -- our Aerospace & Defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, solid growth across all segments. 
As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25%, and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all of '21, that business were still not changing. We're continuing to expect low to mid single-digit organic growth. 
So if I pull the Aerospace & Defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's -- it's bottomed, and it's doing well, but we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom. But everything else besides that is showing an uptrend."

We established record lev",1191,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams. 
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile. The 5 acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year. 
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%. Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added 2 points. 
Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year. 
Our businesses also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results. 
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020. And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%. 
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10. 
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% in net income. 
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter. Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. 
Organic sales were up 27%. Recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly 2 points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus the prior year to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added 3 points to the quarter. 
Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 33% compared to the prior year period. And EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to a record 24.9%. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well. And the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected. 
AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year. 
Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications. 
In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E. And for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. 
For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth. 
As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary cost into our cost structure. While we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price, given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread. 
Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings. 
Now moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. 
For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share. 
For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter. 
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb, with excellent sales and orders growth and high-quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance through the first half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model. 
Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. 
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. 
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs. 
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change, the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. 
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020. 
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. 
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share. 
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash, given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow was $264 million with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. 
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on 5 strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021. 
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9x and 1.6x, respectively. We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy, given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.

And in terms of peaking out, inflation is increasing. We're staying in front of it. I don't think we're ready to say it's peaked yet. I think that there's an element of temporary cost spiking.

And that's the way we're managing the business."

And we're seeing the beginning of a mid-cycle recovery. 
And what we saw in our businesses are our Automation & Engineered Solutions business, this is our classic mid-cycle, that picked up earlier in the year, and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter, our Power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our Power business was a strong mid-30% organic growth. 
So that's -- I think the cycle is kind of falling along we think where our automation businesses would kind of lead us in. And then we have the Process and Power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or 2, we have our commercial aerospace business. So the cycle is kind of following what we think. 
It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issues and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing, but I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last 5 years, and we're well positioned to benefit from that investment. 
So I'm kind of seeing beneath this COVID recovery, the -- a classic cyclical recovery, and it's really hitting our businesses at the part of the cycle where we think it would be. That's -- does that help you out a little bit?"

For our whole Aerospace & Defense business, we're still saying up low to mid-single digits. So we're not seeing the same kind of traction in that business right now, partially because the aftermarket is doing better than the OE business.

So again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand as people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing if you go through our portfolio, look, let's start with our Process businesses, what's our largest business. It grew 20 -- mid-20s organic during the quarter, really a strong level of demand essentially all in margin, leading to really robust sales and orders. 
Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our Ultra Precision Technology business that had a great quarter, and they're benefiting from metrology measurement technology related to automation. And you think about the Power & Industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments, Power & Industrial, and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our IntelliPower business. 
Again, that was broad-based. And the Power & Industrial business was kind of one of the laggers on orders to pick up. And we're really pleased to see that. 
And then we talked about our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. They were up low 20s organic, and that's been strong for a period of time with robust and strong demand continuing. So all of those are strong. 
The -- our Aerospace & Defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, solid growth across all segments. 
As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25%, and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all of '21, that business were still not changing. We're continuing to expect low to mid single-digit organic growth. 
So if I pull the Aerospace & Defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's -- it's bottomed, and it's doing well, but we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom. But everything else besides that is showing an uptrend."

We established record lev",1192,"Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams.
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile. The 5 acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year.
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust, broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%. Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added 2 points.
Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year.
Our business has also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results.
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020. And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%.
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%.
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10.
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% of net income.
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter.
Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 27%. Recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly 2 points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year. And operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period.
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus the prior year to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added 3 points to the quarter.
Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business.
EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 33% compared to the prior year period. And EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to a record 24.9%.
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected.
AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year.
Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications.
In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E. And for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth.
As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure. While we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread.
Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings.
Now moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance.
For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share.
For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter.
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb, with excellent sales and orders growth and high-quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance through the first half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model.
Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020.
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income.
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million.
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on 5 strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021.
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9x and 1.6x, respectively. We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce, has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.

And what we saw in our businesses are our Automation & Engineered Solutions business, this is our classic mid-cycle, that picked up earlier in the year and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter our Power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our Power business was a strong mid-30% organic growth.
So that's -- I think the cycle is kind of falling along. We think our automation businesses would kind of lead us in. And then we have the Process and Power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or 2, we have our commercial aerospace business. So the cycle is kind of following what we think.
It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issues and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing, but I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last 5 years, and we're well positioned to benefit from that investment.

And I think that, that could be one of the outcomes of this economic cycle that we're in.
So we're pretty bullish on the industrial cycle right now. And we think there -- as I mentioned earlier, there is a COVID bounce, and it's pretty difficult to bifurcate the COVID bounce from the long-term growth. But we certainly are seeing customers planning in a way that's different than just a bounce."

So we're still seeing solid growth in China. We understand the press reports as well as anybody about what's going on in those regions. We're still operating all of our plants. We do have pockets where we're dealing with some COVID issues right now, but it's not unlike it's been the past 3 or 4 months, except the fact that there's probably a little more spread in China now.

So again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand as people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing -- if you go through our portfolio, look, let's start with our Process businesses, which are our largest business. It grew 20 -- mid-20s organic during the quarter, really a strong level of demand essentially all end March, leading to really robust sales and orders.
Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our Ultra Precision Technology business that had a great quarter, and they're benefiting from metrology measurement technology related to automation.
And you think about the Power & Industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments, Power & Industrial, and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our IntelliPower business. Again, that was broad-based. And the Power & Industrial business was kind of one of the laggers on orders to pick up. And we're really pleased to see that.
And then we talked about our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. They were up low 20s organic, and that's been strong for a period of time with robust and strong demand continuing. So all of those are strong.
The -- our Aerospace & Defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, solid growth across all segments.
As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25%, and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all of '21, that business were still not changing. We're continuing to expect low to mid single-digit organic growth.
So if I pull the Aerospace & Defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's -- it's bottomed and is doing well, but we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom. But everything else besides that is showing an uptrend."

AMETEK had another outstanding quarter with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance and earnings above our expectations. We established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results, which exceeded our expectations. 
Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues as well as the strength, flexibility and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model. 
AMETEK's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We are very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website. 
Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 23.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment. 
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%. Acquisitions added 16% and foreign currency was a modest headwind. While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies and our Power & Industrial businesses. EIG's third quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 27.2%, in line with prior year margins. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of EMG with our automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, leading to the acquisition of  5 highly strategic businesses. AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. 
Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. 
Our acquisition pipeline remains very active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. 
Through these investments, our businesses developed unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve their customers' most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan. Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy supporting high-end research and materials and life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela hybrid pixel camera the only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. 
This new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position providing the highest quality TEM defraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D STEM analysis with rapid speed and high dynamic range. Gatan's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela Camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called 1 of the 10 game-changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera and for the support of important research applications. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging. We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter and are navigating the challenging environment well given our agile operating approach. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. 
Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter and the continued strong orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous count of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. 
In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continued to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK take orders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter",470,"Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. 
Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. 
Third quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. This gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%. Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million with free cash flow conversion 109% of net income. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.65 billion up less than $250 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. And at quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years.

And during the quarter, we continued to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. 
A key, from my view, is the distributed nature of our business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage in the authority of all of the AMETEK. And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had, as I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor, chip available. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. 
And we're using our purchasing leverage, the relationships that we built up over decades, our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect to anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022. So it's a tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point to one thing, it's a distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders, making sure that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way."

And I just feel the pipeline remains strong. We're very active on exploring opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have a meaningful level of financing capacity and strong cash flows. And we also have -- so I think 2022 is going to be a good year for us. And we're going to have a tailwind from some of the deals we got done this year.

The comment that I'd make is it's a good one, of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible. So you know what your costs are going to be. 
And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible, when we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to lock in costs where appropriate. We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, et cetera. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced if necessary. And then you take into account the higher cost. And when you can, and it's necessary -- you our customers have been fairly receptive to get to -- to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. 
So I put that whole package together. And if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true. But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there. And that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through and to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflations. And with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it."

We think that we'll start to see longer cycle improvement in our commercial aero businesses. Our process industries will continue to recover. We're expecting a stable defense spending environment. 
In terms of some of the headwinds that you mentioned, the challenges from inflation are going to continue, and we're going to have to continue to offset inflation with price. And the supply chain make us -- growth, mainly in the first half of the year. And as I mentioned before, semiconductor availability is a key issue for us. 
And we remain -- the final thing is we remain active in capital deployment with significant balance sheet capacity with a primary focus on M&A. So we're really bullish about what we're going to be able to accomplish in 2022.

And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth with particularly strong growth within our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses as new products and their differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market. And for the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco. 
Organic sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year and solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business jet businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single digits and our commercial businesses to be up low singles. So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial business has had a good quarter. 
Go to the Power & Industrial market segment next, up nearly 40% in the quarter driven by mid-20s organic sales growth. So they had a very good quarter. Also acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. 
And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. And both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets. And for all of '21, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses and our Engineered Solutions business. So the automation business is doing very well. 
As customers want to remove labor from their processes, they want to move things contamination-free. We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the right technologies that are winning share. So -- and we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely. So the automation business is in a really good position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. 
You mentioned geography. I'll go around the geographies. So we've had strong broad-based growth across geographies, where every geography was up. The U.S. was up 15%. Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia. It was up 25% with broad-based strength and notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia.

We had really solid growth in our Rauland business and our record business really driven by new products in record. 
And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3. So we were up in the quarter. It wasn't up 15%. It was up high single digits, and we're benefiting from elective surgeries in things like neurostimulation, cardiac mapping catheters, all that stuff as  people are going back to hospitals, getting those procedures done, and we expect that to grow -- this quarter was a high single-digit kind of number. We expect that to grow more next year.

It's a healthy amount for an industrial business, but we think it gives us a couple of things. One is in these new sales from -- new product sales but also it gives us the ability to raise price because we're investing for our customers, and we're going to have the latest products that have the most value for our customers. So the investments that we make, we also link to the pricing capability in our business. So that's an important factor for us."

And as I said, we have a lot of people that we have relationships that will build over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage. And probably most importantly, if a product's not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives. 
We set up a group within our company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe and some of our engineers and the U.S. and there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through. So one of the things that we've been able to differentiate versus maybe some other people in the market is we have the strong engineering capability that can work on these problems as they come up and solve them quickly."

AMETEK had another outstanding quarter with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance and earnings above our expectations. We established records before sales, EBITDA, operating income and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results, which exceeded our expectations. 
Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues as well as the strength, flexibility and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model. 
AMETEK's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We are very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website. 
Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 23.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment. 
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16% and foreign currency was a modest headwind. While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies and our Power & Industrial businesses. EIG's third quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 27.2%, in line with prior year margins. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of EMG with our automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, leading to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses. AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. 
Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. 
Our acquisition pipeline remains very active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. 
Through these investments, our businesses developed unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve their customers' most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan. Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy, supporting high-end research and materials and life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela Hybrid-Pixel Camera, the only fully integrated hybrid-pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. 
This new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position providing the highest quality TEM defraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D STEM analysis with rapid speed and high dynamic range. Gatan's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela Camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game-changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera and for the support of important research applications. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging. We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. 
Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter and the continued strong orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous count of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. 
In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continue to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK take orders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.",470,"Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million, driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. 
Third quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. This gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%. Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of net income. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.65 billion up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. And at quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin?"

And during the quarter, we continued to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key, from my view, is the distributed nature of our business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage in the authority of all of the AMETEK. 
And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had, as I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor, chip available. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using our purchasing leverage, the relationships that we built up over decades, our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources, in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect to anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022.

That's a good question, Allison, because what we do is we set our plan based on material availability, and we executed that plan extremely well. In fact, we beat our expectations. But we did at the end of the quarter. I look at it as, if the stars aligned, what could we have shipped without some of the material availability issues. And it was about an additional $50 million that shifted out of Q3 to Q4. And I feel like we're going to have the same kind of shift of Q4 into Q1 so we're able to meet demand. We're able to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it but there was about $50 million that slipped out. Now we're not a big labor business. We have -- labor is not a big cost driver for us. So labor availability is tough, but we're able to get the products manufactured with the labor available.

The comment that I'd make is it's a good one, of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible. So you know what your costs are going to be. 
And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible, when we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to lock in costs where appropriate. We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, et cetera. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced, if necessary. And then you take into account the higher cost. And when you can, and it's necessary, you're -- our customers have been fairly receptive to get to -- to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. 
So I put that whole package together. And if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true. But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there. And that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through and to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflations. And with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it."

I mentioned in the prepared remarks that it was a broad-based growth. And I'll take a walk around the company, David. And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth with particularly strong growth within our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses as new products and their differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market. And for the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter, driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco. 
Organic sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year and solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business jet businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single digits and our commercial businesses to be up low singles. So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial business has had a good quarter. Go to the Power & Industrial market segment next. Up nearly 40% in the quarter driven by mid-20s organic sales growth so they had a very good quarter. Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. 
And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. And both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets. And for all of '21, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses and our Engineered Solutions business. So the automation business is doing very well. 
As customers want to remove labor from their processes, they want to move things contamination-free. We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the right technologies that are winning share. So -- and we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely. So the automation business is in a really good position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. You mentioned geography. I'll go around the geographies. So we've had strong broad-based growth across geographies, where every geography was up. The U.S. was up 15%. Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia, it was up 25% with broad-based strength and notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia.

And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3. So we were up in the quarter.

And as I said, we have a lot of people that we have relationships that will build over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage. And probably most importantly, if a product's not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives. We set up a group within our company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe and some of our engineers and the U.S. And there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through.

AMETEK had another outstanding quarter with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance and earnings above our expectations. We established records before sales, EBITDA, operating income and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results, which exceeded our expectations. 
Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues as well as the strength, flexibility and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model. 
AMETEK's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We are very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website. 
Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 23.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment. 
Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16% and foreign currency was a modest headwind. While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies and our Power & Industrial businesses. EIG's third quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 27.2%, in line with prior year margins. 
The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of EMG with our automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. 
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, leading to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses. AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. 
Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. 
Our acquisition pipeline remains very active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. 
Through these investments, our businesses developed unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve their customers' most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan. Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy, supporting high-end research and materials and life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela Hybrid-Pixel Camera, the only fully integrated hybrid-pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. 
This new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position providing the highest quality TEM defraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D STEM analysis with rapid speed and high dynamic range. Gatan's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela Camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game-changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera and for the support of important research applications. 
Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging. We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. 
Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter and the continued strong orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous count of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. 
In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continue to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK take orders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.",470,"Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter with continued strong sales growth and orders growth and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million, driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. 
Third quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. This gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%. Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. 
Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of net income. 
Total debt at quarter end was $2.65 billion up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. And at quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. 
To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin?"

And these conditions were a bit worse",309,"Yes, that's a good question. And during the quarter, we continued to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key, from my view, is the distributed nature of our business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage in the authority of all of the AMETEK. 
And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had, as I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor, chip available. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using our purchasing leverage, the relationships that we built up over decades, our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources, in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect to anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022. So it's a tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point to one thing, it's a distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders, making sure that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way."

We're able to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it but there was about $50 million that slipped out. Now we're not a big labor business.

The comment that I'd make is it's a good one, of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible. So you know what your costs are going to be. 
And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible, when we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to lock in costs where appropriate. We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, et cetera. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced, if necessary. And then you take into account the higher cost. And when you can, and it's necessary, you're -- our customers have been fairly receptive to get to -- to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. 
So I put that whole package together. And if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true. But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there. And that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through and to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflations. And with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it."

And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth with particularly strong growth within our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses as new products and their differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market. And for the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter, driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco. 
Organic sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year and solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business jet businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single digits and our commercial businesses to be up low singles. So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial business has had a good quarter. Go to the Power & Industrial market segment next. Up nearly 40% in the quarter driven by mid-20s organic sales growth so they had a very good quarter. Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. 
And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. And both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets. And for all of '21, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses and our Engineered Solutions business.

And probably most importantly, if a product's not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives. We set up a group within our company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe and some of our engineers and the U.S. And there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through.

Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance led to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams.
We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid- and long-cycle business profile. The 5 acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely and are well positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year.
Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust, broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%. Acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added 2 points.
Overall orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year.
Our business has also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges as is reflected in our results.
Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020. And operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 22.8%.
Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core margins -- core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points to 24%.
EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10.
Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% of net income.
Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter.
Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 27%. Recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly 2 points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year. And operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period.
The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus the prior year to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added 3 points to the quarter.
Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business.
EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 33% compared to the prior year period. And EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to a record 24.9%.
Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected.
AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year.
Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications.
In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E. And for the full year, we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our front-end sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth.
As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure. While we are seeing higher levels of inflation due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we are capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions and allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread.
Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings.
Now moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance.
For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share.
For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter.
In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb, with excellent sales and orders growth and high-quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance through the first half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model.
Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK Growth Model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.
I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?"

As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.
Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6% compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. rate change and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.
Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020.
Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share.
As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income.
Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million.
As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software and Magnetrol, which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on 5 strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021.
At quarter end, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio were 1.9x and 1.6x, respectively. We remain well positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation and the dedication of our world-class workforce, has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021 and beyond.

And what we saw in our businesses are our Automation & Engineered Solutions business, this is our classic mid-cycle, that picked up earlier in the year and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter our Power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our Power business was a strong mid-30% organic growth.
So that's -- I think the cycle is kind of falling along. We think our automation businesses would kind of lead us in. And then we have the Process and Power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or 2, we have our commercial aerospace business. So the cycle is kind of following what we think.
It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issues and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing, but I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last 5 years, and we're well positioned to benefit from that investment.

So again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand as people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing -- if you go through our portfolio, look, let's start with our Process businesses, which are our largest business. It grew 20 -- mid-20s organic during the quarter, really a strong level of demand essentially all end March, leading to really robust sales and orders.
Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our Ultra Precision Technology business that had a great quarter, and they're benefiting from metrology measurement technology related to automation.
And you think about the Power & Industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments, Power & Industrial, and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our IntelliPower business. Again, that was broad-based. And the Power & Industrial business was kind of one of the laggers on orders to pick up. And we're really pleased to see that.
And then we talked about our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. They were up low 20s organic, and that's been strong for a period of time with robust and strong demand continuing. So all of those are strong.
The -- our Aerospace & Defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, solid growth across all segments.
As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25%, and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all of '21, that business were still not changing. We're continuing to expect low to mid single-digit organic growth.
So if I pull the Aerospace & Defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's -- it's bottomed and is doing well, but we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom. But everything else besides that is showing an uptrend."
