And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. This morning, I will start off by giving you a recap of our 2020 business performance and provide highlights on how we are well positioned for future growth. Then David Slater will give some details in our Midstream business and provide an update on the spin transaction. Dave Ruud will provide a financial review of the year and wrap things up before we take your questions. 
So let's start on Slide 4. 2020 was clearly a challenging year for so many with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting everyone's lives. And as I reflected on this past year, I think the best way to characterize my thoughts is pride. And can not be prouder of how our DTE family confronted these challenges and put them head on and create incredible success in every part of our company. I am proud of how our employees responded to ensure their own safety and the safety of our communities while continuing to deliver for our customers. 
DTE also delivered very strong financial results, continuing on an incredible track record of success. In 2020, we achieved extraordinary engagement and safety performance. We achieved our safest year on record. As you all know, the safety of our people and our customers has always been our top priority at DTE. I am so incredibly proud of our team for this achievement while navigating through a pandemic. 
Additionally, our team remained highly engaged throughout the year. We were ranked by Gallup among the top 5% globally for employee engagement, earning our eighth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. Best-in-class employee engagement is our secret sauce that defines our strong work culture and provides a foundation for long-term value creation and repeated success on the delivery of our goals. And as I said, our DTE team stepped up in supporting our customers and communities through these tough times in 2020. 
Our team significantly streamlined payment plans for customers impacted by COVID-19. We found creative ways to shelf rate case filings, which were supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, effectively keeping rates unchanged for customers through 2021. DTE led a $23 million initiative that provided 51,000 tablets as well as Internet access to the trade public school students, assuring that education would not be interrupted. 
We also donated over 2 million masks to emergency managers, first responders and hospitals when PPE supplies were low. The DTE Foundation contributed to pandemic-related relief efforts in unprecedented ways in 2020. 
Finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our team worked together to execute our economic response plan to ensure strong financial performance. We quickly analyzed how the pandemic could affect our company, customers and communities and put a plan in place to minimize the impacts. We then followed through and executed on that plan. Our workforce of over 10,000 employees embraced our culture and continuous improvement and found opportunities to increase efficiency across all of our businesses. 
This work led to a successful year in 2020 and set DTE up well for the future. I want to congratulate all of our DTE family who delivered one of the best years on many fronts since I have been with the company. 
I'll discuss our 2020 accomplishments on the next slide. As I mentioned, the success of 2020 was fueled by the execution of our economic response plan, which led to really strong earnings. 2020 was also a year of very strong cash flows for DTE, and we were able to use some of that strength to increase investment in our operations, position us nicely for 2021. 
Our 2020 operating EPS of $7.19 represents 14% growth over DTE's 2019 operating EPS. This is nearly 9% higher than our original 2020 guidance midpoint. 2020 was the 12th consecutive year we exceeded our original guidance midpoint. This success demonstrates our team's commitment to deliver results and continuous improvement. We also increased our dividend 7% for 2021, marking the 12th consecutive year of a dividend increase. 
In addition to solid financials, DTE achieved many regulatory and operational successes in 2020. DTE Electric received approval for an innovative onetime voluntary refund to customers for unexpected COVID-19-related sales. This will help maintain our customer affordability and positions DTE Electric to further defer its next rate case filing. We will continue to work on innovative ways to delay rate cases. DTE Gas reached a constructive rate case settlement, which was approved by the MPSC in August. As a result, both utilities achieved regulatory certainty in 2020 that allows us to keep base rate steady for customers through 2021. 
We are very proud of these accomplishments as we continue our commitment to provide reliable, affordable energy to our customers. I will go into more detail on the 2020 achievements for utilities in a few minutes. 
Our nonutility businesses also achieved operational successes in 2020. DTE Midstream placed a lead pipeline in service ahead of schedule and under budget and began delivering for our customers, not a small feat in today's environment. 
At P&I, we continue to focus on the development of RNG and cogeneration projects to backfill the sunsetting REF business. In 2020, we operationalized our responsing R&D project in Ford central energy plant and also finalized an additional cogeneration project. This continues our cadence to new private completion, accompanied by a strong pipeline for future drilling. 
Turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss how DTE is positioned for future success. Overall, our achievements in 2020 have set us up well for continued success in 2021. Our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint of $7.07 provides 7% growth over 2020 original guidance. The vast majority of our growth comes from our utility businesses. 
At DTE Electric, we are investing heavily in the modernization of the grid and cleaner generation. At DTE Gas, we continue our main renewal work as well as infrastructure improvements. We continue our steady growth in our nonutility businesses through strategic and sustainable investments. 
As you know, we are executing the spin of our Midstream business this year. David Slater will give you more details, but let me just say that the transaction is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion of the year. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and establishes Midstream as an independent C-corp gas midstream company. We truly believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors in both companies. 
We are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth for DTE from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. That will continue to provide an attractive and growing dividend to investors. DTE has a long track record of delivering premium shareholder returns, consistently beating the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and we plan to continue delivering for our investors. As I said, we have exceeded the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance for 12 straight years. And early in this year, we feel we are well positioned to continue our streak in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll highlight some of the successes of DTE Electric. Both utilities progressed on key missions in 2020 while navigating the pandemic. For DTE Electric, that has included clean energy investments as well as investments to accelerate the modernization of our electric grid. In 2020, DTE Electric commissioned the largest wind park in Michigan, which is the Polaris wind park, with 68 turbines generating 168 megawatts of power. 
Our voluntary renewables program, MIGreenPower, continues to exceed our high expectations. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation with 850 megawatts of commitments to date and 25,000 customers enrolled. Enrollment in this program have doubled over the past year. We continue to be excited about this program and see additional opportunity for expansion as the customer enrollments continue to grow. These accomplishments helped DTE Electric work towards this net 0 carbon emission target by 2050. 
DTE Electric also announced its commitment to promote electric vehicles by joining forces and other companies to facilitate the construction of a network of fast-turning stations across the Midwest. To assist our customers with affordability during the pandemic, we found an innovative plan to delay an electric rate case filing. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved this plan, allowing us to provide steady base rates to our customers and regulatory certainty for our company and investors. Commission also approved a onetime customer refund for unexpected load increases from additional residential usage from customers working from home due to COVID-19. This allows us to defer our next rate case even further and keep customer rates steady longer. 
Looking forward, the future is bright for DTE Electric. At DDI Conference, we rolled forward our 5-year capital plan, which included a 17% increase in capital of the electric company compared to our prior plan. These investments are focused on cleaner energy as well as infrastructure investments for reliability and growth. We're also creating substations for current and future low growth and addressing aging infrastructure to position the grid in the future. Through the implementation of this plan, DTE Electric is targeting 7% to 8% long-term operating earnings growth. 
Moving to Slide 8, I'll describe the successes of DTE Gas. DTE Gas progressed on key initiatives in 2020 and is well positioned for growth. We announced the innovative program to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This program is a first of its kind and incorporates emission-reduction opportunities for suppliers and customers. 
Recently, we also announced a voluntary program for customers to purchase current assets and renewable natural gas to offset 25% to 100% of the average homes gas use emissions. We progressed on a major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan. This project includes installation of a new pipeline and facility modification work, provide redundancy and mitigate customer eligen. We have completed the first of 3 phases for this project, with the second phase scheduled to begin in June. 
DTE Gas also continued man real upgrades and operational improvements in 2020, including completing 206 new renewal miles despite a pause in work during the height of the pandemic in the Spain. Finally, DTE Gas issued a rate case settlement in August that supports investment plans and provides regulatory certainty through 2021. 
The current capital plan for DTE Gas includes additional opportunities that could potentially be included as we continue to find ways to create headroom and affordability of continuous improvement. Our 5-year investment plan of DTE Gas focuses on Marel, pipeline and transmission integrity and enhanced technology. Upgrading our system and replacing aging infrastructure continues our path to reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. 
DTE Gas recently filed a gas rate case with the MPSC in support of these investments in infrastructure and reliability for our customers. With our usual 10-month rate case cycle, new rates will be effective in 2023. 
Before I turn it over to David later, who will walk you through the successful year that Midstream had and give updates on the spin transaction progress, let me congratulate him on being elected to serve on the Board as Chairman the industry group representing Interstate Gas Pipelines. David, over to you."

The next year will be a defining period for our industry, and I look forward to ensuring that policymakers and regulators understand the importance of natural gas in the lower-carbon future. 
I'll start on Slide 9. As Jerry mentioned earlier, our spin transaction is well underway, and we recently initiated the Form 10 process. This keeps us firmly on schedule for a midyear spin. 
I'll now discuss the successes Midstream achieved across all of our platforms last year and then go over the execution of our spin transaction. In case LEAP in service last summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. It is a 155-mile, 36-inch pipeline that extends our gathering system to the Gulf Coast Interstate systems and LNG export markets. This asset is a great addition to our portfolio. 
We delivered strong financial results this year across all of our platforms, producing strong adjusted EBITDA of $713 million, which was above plan. We also executed a 3-year contract on NEXUS with our high utility, and we continue to see strong interest in NEXUS capacity. Overall, portfolio continues to be well contracted. Our major customers are in solid positions, connected to premium markets and have minimal near-term debt maturities. 
I also wanted to mention that Midstream recently announced a net 0 emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such a goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets and believe this will evolve to become a significant opportunity over time for Midstream. 
With the position of our assets and the strength of our counterparties and contracts, the Midstream company has highly visible cash flows and a stable long-term outlook. We remain focused on disciplined capital deployment to fuel our growth and are supported by a flexible, well-capitalized balance sheet. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to leverage these positive attributes to further advance the company and create value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 10. The Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade and a solid, steady, strategic transformation has positioned Midstream to become an industry leader it is today. We felt that naming the company DTE Midstream will allow us to build on DTE's legacy of success as we progress on our new journey. 
As I said earlier, the spin is well underway with the expected completion by midyear. We began the SEC Form 10 initial registration process earlier this month. We will be leading with the rating agencies and initiating a debt raise in the second quarter. Throughout this process, we will be hosting events with analysts and investors and are planning to hold a roadshow in June. 
I am feeling very optimistic about our leadership team. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, Bob Skaggs will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. I am pleased to announce that Jeff Jewell, who is currently Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer of DTE Energy, will become the CFO of DTE Midstream. I have worked with Jeff for years, and I tell you that both Bob and I are delighted to have him join our leadership team. He is a highly qualified expert and has a solid track record of delivering results. 
I am confident that Midstream is well positioned for the future. Our seasoned leadership team, proven track record of success and our unique set of assets will allow us to deliver strong financial results year after year. 2021 will continue this track record with a targeted EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million and a strong capital structure with an initial 4x debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 2x dividend coverage ratio that will provide financial flexibility. 
The portfolio generates significant cash flow and is well positioned to create value for our investors. The spin will provide Midstream strategic opportunities and optionality to continue this record of success. And I'm looking forward to talking to many of you between now and the spin completion. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."
266598,703432099,2216747,"DTE Energy Company, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financi",1127,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financial results while providing great service for our customers. 
As Jerry mentioned, we executed on our economic response plan to offset the impacts of the pandemic and warm winter weather. With our quick action and the incredible performance from the whole team, we were able to achieve solid financial performance across all of our business lines. 
Let me start on Slide 11 to review our year-end financial results. Total operating earnings for the year were $1.4 billion. This translates into $7.19 per share for the year. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. 
I'll start to review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $813 million for the year. This was $97 million higher than 2019 primarily due to higher residential sales from more people working from home during the year and new rate implementation, offset by rate base growth costs. 
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $196 million, $15 million higher than last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by onetime O&M cost savings, new rate implementation and the infrastructure recovery mechanism revenue was offset by warmer-than-normal weather and rate base growth cost. 
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $303 million. This was $90 million higher than last year, with strong performance in each of our platforms driven primarily by a full year of Blue Union earnings and placing a LEAP pipeline in service last summer. 
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment operating were $150 million. This is a $17 million increase from 2019 due to new industrial energy services and RNG projects, offset by steel-related sales. 
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $39 million. This is $9 million higher than last year mainly due to performance in the gas portfolio. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $7.19 per share in 2020, which is $0.89 per share higher than 2019. 
Let's move to Slide 12. As Jerry mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance. We would like to remind you that this guidance does not reflect the strategic separation impacts, and any post-transaction guidance will be provided later in the process as we approach the spin date. 
Our 2021 operating EPS guidance range is $6.88 to $7.26 per share. The midpoint of $7.07 per share, which is 7% growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. We are comparing our 2021 guidance to the 2020 original guidance midpoint to normalize the onetime items included in the 2020 actual results given that 2020 was such a unique year. 
Our 2020 results include a number of nonrecurring items, and we experienced higher COVID-related residential electric sales, which are projected to begin to normalize in 2021. These sales were in part offset by the voluntary refund to customers. We also had onetime interest and investment returns, higher Energy Trading earnings, and we experienced higher-than-planned nonutility earnings due to conservative planning and cost control during COVID. We are projecting another strong year in 2021 with growth in each segment. 
At DTE Electric, growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. As we said before, we have worked and continue to work to hold electric base rates flat for our customers. DTE Gas will see continued investment in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements that provide enhanced reliability for our customers. GSP will continue organic growth across all its pipeline and gathering platforms, and continued RNG and cogeneration project development will drive growth at P&I. 
Now let's move to Slide 13 to talk about our long-term growth. The spin transaction unlocks the full potential of our premier regulated utilities and premium natural gas Midstream business. DTE becomes a high-growth, predominantly pure-play, regulated and Michigan-based utility. If you look at our post-spin business, we are growing at 7.4% from our 2020 pro forma operating EPS original guidance midpoint, excluding Midstream impacts. 
In addition, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2025 from the 2020 original guidance despite significant milestones during that time, which includes the conversion of $1.3 billion of mandatory equity units in 2022 and the sunsetting of the REF business at the end of this year. Over 90% of our operating earnings will come from our 2 utilities, which will deliver operating earnings growth from [indiscernible] leaders of the plan that are higher than their average operating earnings growth over the 5 years. Overall, we feel optimistic about our outlook and our operational and financial performance. 
Let's turn to Slide 14 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining strong cash flows and solid balance sheet metrics. Due to the strong cash flows in 2020, DTE is starting in the low end of our planned equity issuances in 2021 and continues to have minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We are maintaining our focus on our leverage and cash flow metrics. 
As we have mentioned before, the spin transaction will be credit-enhancing, allowing us to lower our FFO-to-debt target from 18% to approximately 16% while maintaining a solid credit position. 
We continue to focus on top-tier cash management as we put fast action to ensure strong liquidity at the onset of the pandemic that resulted in having $3.1 billion of available liquidity at the end of last year. 
Now I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open it up for Q&A. As we have demonstrated today, DTE had a very strong year in 2020. And clearly, this is a result of the incredibly hard work of every member of our DTE family. Throughout the year impacted so greatly by the pandemic, we were able to continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. The DTE team achieved remarkable engagement and safety performance. We also were able to assist our customers and communities during the pandemic in unprecedented ways. 
Our DTE team delivered our 12th consecutive year of exceeding our original guidance midpoint while also increasing our dividend and positioning DTE for success in 2021 and into the future. 
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

We have seen from a customer/producer perspective what freeze-offs, and it's really driven by an extended period of very frigid weather in the Louisiana, Texas area. And that, over time, does affect production. That said, it looks like the weather is breaking today and tomorrow.

Yes, that's a very good question and topical in the country right now. So first off, in January, we announced a net 0 2050 target for the Midstream business, with a milestone of getting 30% of the way there by the end of this decade.",304,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yes, that's a very good question and topical in the country right now. So first off, in January, we announced a net 0 2050 target for the Midstream business, with a milestone of getting 30% of the way there by the end of this decade. 
So there's -- there'll be lots of actions that we'll take around that. But I'd say at the very highest level, Steve, there is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the energy infrastructure that carries natural gas. Just to frame it up, it carries about 1/3 of the energy we consume every day in North America. So it's a massive energy distribution system. And just as DTE has successfully decarbonized and is it on our pathway to decarbonize the electric grid, I believe the same opportunity exists for the natural gas energy distribution system. 
So that -- I expect that over time, that's going to take capital investments. And creating the policy framework to enable those capital investments, I think, is important. So I'm kind of pivoting now to the INGA conversation. And at INGA, I announced 2 weeks ago a statement on behalf of the industry that the industry is committed to a net 0 aspiration by 2050. 
So there's definitely a a desire to move in this direction amongst all the industry participants and work closely with the new administration and just societal requirements to move to a lower-carbon footprint. So again, I think over time, this is going to create investment opportunities in the infrastructure. And I think the task before us right now is to -- we have a lot of great technology that can be deployed quickly. That's what I'll call on the shelf technology, working with the regulators to create the framework to allow that to happen across the industry broadly."

So let's start on Slide 4. 2020 was clearly a challenging year for so many with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting everyone's lives. And as I reflected on this past year, I think the best way to characterize my thoughts is pride. I cannot be prouder of how our DTE family confronted these challenges and put them head on and create incredible success in every part of our company. I am proud of how our employees responded to ensure their own safety and the safety of our communities while continuing to deliver for our customers.  
DTE also delivered very strong financial results, continuing on an incredible track record of success. In 2020, we achieved extraordinary engagement and safety performance. We achieved our safest year on record. As you all know, the safety of our people and our customers has always been our top priority at DTE. I am so incredibly proud of our team for this achievement while navigating through a pandemic.  
Additionally, our team remained highly engaged throughout the year. We were ranked by Gallup among the top 5% globally for employee engagement, earning our eighth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. Best-in-class employee engagement is our secret sauce that defines our strong work culture and provides a foundation for long-term value creation and repeated success on the delivery of our goals. And as I said, our DTE team stepped up and supported our customers and communities through these tough times in 2020.  
Well, thanks, Barb. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. This morning, I will start off by giving you a recap of our 2020 business performance and provide highlights on how we are well positioned for future growth. Then David Slater will give some details in our Midstream business and provide an update on the spin transaction. Dave Ruud will provide a financial review of the year and wrap things up before we take your questions.

And as I said, our DTE team stepped up in supporting our customers and communities through these tough times in 2020.  
Our team significantly streamlined payment plans for customers impacted by COVID-19. We found creative ways to shelf rate case filings, which were supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, effectively keeping rates unchanged for customers through 2021. DTE led a $23 million initiative that provided 51,000 tablets as well as Internet access to Detroit Public School students, assuring that education would not be interrupted. We also donated over 2 million masks to emergency managers, first responders and hospitals when PPE supplies were low. The DTE Foundation contributed to pandemic-related relief efforts in unprecedented ways in 2020.  
Finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our team worked together to execute our economic response plan to ensure strong financial performance. We quickly analyzed how the pandemic could affect our company, customers and communities and put a plan in place to minimize the impacts. We then followed through and executed on that plan. Our workforce of over 10,000 employees embraced our culture and continuous improvement and found opportunities to increase efficiency across all of our businesses. This work led to a successful year in 2020 and set DTE up well for the future. I want to congratulate all of our DTE family who delivered one of the best years on many fronts since I have been with the company.  
I'll discuss our 2020 accomplishments on the next slide. As I mentioned, the success of 2020 was fueled by the execution of our economic response plan, which led to really strong earnings. 2020 was also a year of very strong cash flows for DTE, and we were able to use some of that strength to increase investment in our operations, positioning us nicely for 2021.  
Our 2020 operating EPS of $7.19 represents 14% growth over DTE's 2019 operating EPS. This is nearly 9% higher than our original 2020 guidance midpoint. 2020 was the 12th consecutive year we exceeded our original guidance midpoint. This success demonstrates our team's commitment to deliver results and continuous improvement. We also increased our dividend to 7% for 2021, marking the 12th consecutive year of a dividend increase.  
In addition to solid financials, DTE achieved many regulatory and operational successes in 2020. DTE Electric received approval for an innovative onetime voluntary refund to customers for unexpected COVID-19-related sales. This will help maintain our customer affordability and positions DTE Electric to further defer its next rate case filing. We will continue to work on innovative ways to delay rate cases. DTE Gas reached a constructive rate case settlement, which was approved by the MPSC in August. As a result, both utilities achieved regulatory certainty in 2020 that allows us to keep base rate steady for customers through 2021.  
We are very proud of these accomplishments as we continue our commitment to provide reliable, affordable energy to our customers. I will go into more detail on the 2020 achievements for utilities in a few minutes. Our nonutility businesses also achieved operational successes in 2020. DTE Midstream placed a lead pipeline in service ahead of schedule and under budget and began delivering for our customers, not a small feat in today's environment.  
At P&I, we continue to focus on the development of RNG and cogeneration projects to backfill the sunsetting REF business. In 2020, we operationalized our Wisconsin RNG project and Ford Central Energy Plant and also finalized an additional cogeneration project. This continues our cadence to new private completion, accompanied by a strong pipeline for future growth.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss how DTE is positioned for future success. Overall, our achievements in 2020 have set us up well for continued success in 2021. Our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint of $7.07 provides 7% growth over 2020 original guidance. The vast majority of our growth comes from our utility businesses.  
At DTE Electric, we are investing heavily in the modernization of the grid and cleaner generation. At DTE Gas, we continue our main renewal work as well as infrastructure improvements. We continue our steady growth in our nonutility businesses through strategic and sustainable investments.  
As you know, we are executing the spin of our Midstream business this year. David Slater will give you more details, but let me just say that the transaction is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and establishes Midstream as an independent C-corp gas midstream company. We truly believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors of both companies.  
We are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth for DTE from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. It will continue to provide an attractive and growing dividend to investors. DTE has a long track record of delivering premium shareholder returns, consistently beating the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and we plan to continue delivering for our investors. As I said, we have exceeded the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance for 12 straight years. And early in this year, we feel we are well positioned to continue that streak in 2021.  
Turning to Slide 7. I'll highlight some of the successes of DTE Electric. Both utilities progressed on key missions in 2020 while navigating the pandemic. For DTE Electric, that has included clean energy investments as well as investments to accelerate the modernization of our electric grid. In 2020, DTE Electric commissioned a largest wind park in Michigan, which is the Polaris wind park, with 68 turbines generating 168 megawatts of power.  
Our voluntary renewables program, MIGreenPower, continues to exceed our high expectations. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation with 850 megawatts of commitments to date and 25,000 customers enrolled. Enrollment in this program have doubled over the past year. We continue to be excited about this program and see additional opportunity for expansion as the customer enrollments continue to grow. These accomplishments helped DTE Electric work towards this net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.  
DTE Electric also announced its commitment to promote electric vehicles by joining forces and other companies to facilitate the construction of a network of fast-charging stations across the Midwest. To assist our customers with affordability during the pandemic, we found an innovative plan to delay an electric rate case filing. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved this plan, allowing us to provide steady base rates to our customers and regulatory certainty for our company and investors. Commission also approved a onetime customer refund for unexpected load increases from additional residential usage from customers working from home due to COVID-19. This allows us to defer our next rate case even further and keep customer rates steady longer.  
Looking forward, the future is bright for DTE Electric. At the EEI Conference, we rolled forward our 5-year capital plan, which included a 17% increase in capital of the electric company compared to our prior plan. These investments were focused on cleaner energy as well as infrastructure investments for reliability and growth. We're also creating substations for current and future low growth and addressing aging infrastructure position the grid in the future. Through the implementation of this plan, DTE Electric is targeting 7% to 8% long-term operating earnings growth.  
Moving to Slide 8, I'll describe the successes of DTE Gas. DTE Gas progressed on key initiatives in 2020 and is well positioned for future growth. We announced the innovative program to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This program is a first of its kind and incorporates emission-reduction opportunities for suppliers and customers.  
Recently, we also announced a voluntary program for customers to purchase carbon offsets and renewable natural gas to offset 25% to 100% of the average homes gas use emissions. We progressed on a major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan. This project includes installation of new pipeline and facility modification work, provide redundancy and mitigate customer outages. We have completed the first of 3 phases for this project, with the second phase scheduled to begin in June.  
DTE Gas also continued man real upgrades and operational improvements in 2020, including completing 206 main renewal miles despite a pause in work during the height of the pandemic and the spring. Finally, DTE Gas achieved a rate case settlement in August that supports investment plans and provides regulatory certainty through 2021.  
The current capital plan for DTE Gas includes additional opportunities that could potentially be included as we continue to find ways to create headroom and affordability with continuous improvement. Our 5-year investment plan of DTE Gas focuses on main renewal, pipeline and transmission integrity and enhanced technology. Upgrading our system and replacing aging infrastructure continues our path for reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. DTE Gas recently filed a gas rate case with the MPSC in support of these investments in infrastructure and reliability for our customers. With our usual 10-month rate case cycle, new rates will be effective in 2022.  
Before I turn it over to David Slater, who will walk you through the successful year of Midstream ahead and give updates on the spin transaction progress, let me congratulate him on being elected to serve on INGAA Board as Chairman of the industry group representing interstate gas pipelines. 
David, over to you."

I'll start on Slide 9. As",691,"Thanks, Jerry, for the kind words. The next year will be a defining period for our industry, and I look forward to ensuring that policymakers and regulators understand the importance of natural gas in the lower-carbon future.  
I'll start on Slide 9. As Jerry mentioned earlier, our spin transaction is well underway, and we recently initiated the Form 10 process. This keeps us firmly on schedule for a midyear spin.  
I'll now discuss the success that Midstream achieved across all of our platforms last year and then go over the execution of our spin transaction. 
We placed the LEAP in service last summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. It is a 155-mile, 36-inch pipeline that extends our gathering system to the Gulf Coast Interstate systems and LNG export markets. This asset is a great addition to our portfolio.  
We delivered strong financial results this year across all of our platforms, producing strong adjusted EBITDA of $713 million, which was above plan. We also executed a 3-year contract on NEXUS with Ohio utility, and we continue to see strong interest in NEXUS capacity. Overall, portfolio continues to be well contracted. Our major customers are in solid positions, connected to premium markets and have minimal near-term debt maturities.  
I also wanted to mention that Midstream recently announced a net zero emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such a goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets and believe this will evolve to become a significant opportunity over time for Midstream.  
With the position of our assets and the strength of our counterparties and contracts, the Midstream company has highly visible cash flows and a stable long-term outlook. We remain focused on disciplined capital deployment to fuel our growth and are supported by a flexible, well-capitalized balance sheet. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to leverage these positive attributes to further advance the company and create value.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10. The Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade and a solid, steady, strategic transformation has positioned Midstream to become an industry leader it is today. We felt that naming the company DTE Midstream will allow us to build on DTE's legacy of success as we progress on our new journey.  
As I said earlier, the spin is well underway with the expected completion by midyear. We began the SEC Form 10 initial registration process earlier this month. We will be leading with the rating agencies and initiating a debt raise in the second quarter. Throughout this process, we will be hosting events with analysts and investors and are planning to hold a roadshow in June.  
I am feeling very optimistic about our leadership team. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, Bob Skaggs will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. I am pleased to announce that Jeff Jewell, who is currently Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer of DTE Energy, will become the CFO of DTE Midstream. I have worked with Jeff for years, and I can tell you that both Bob and I are delighted to have him join our leadership team. He is a highly qualified expert and has a solid track record of delivering results.  
I am confident that Midstream is well positioned for the future. Our seasoned leadership team, proven track record of success and our unique set of assets will allow us to deliver strong financial results year after year. 2021 will continue this track record with a targeted EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million and a strong capital structure with an initial 4x debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 2x dividend coverage ratio that will provide financial flexibility. The portfolio generates significant cash flow and is well positioned to create value for our investors. The spin will provide Midstream strategic opportunities and optionality to continue this record of success. And I'm looking forward to talking to many of you between now and the spin completion.  
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."

As Jerry mentioned, we executed on our economic response plan to offset the impacts of the pandemic and warm winter weather. With our quick action and the incredible performance from the whole team, we were able to achieve solid financial performance across all of our business units.  
Let me start on Slide 11 to review our year-end financial results. Total operating earnings for the year were $1.4 billion. This translates into $7.19 per share for the year. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.  
I'll start to review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $813 million for the year. This was $97 million higher than 2019 primarily due to higher residential sales from more people working from home during the year and new rate implementation, offset by rate base growth costs.  
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $196 million, $15 million higher than last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by onetime O&M cost savings, new rate implementation and the infrastructure recovery mechanism revenue was offset by warmer-than-normal weather and rate base growth cost.  
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $303 million. This was $90 million higher than last year, with strong performance in each of our platforms driven primarily by a full year of Blue Union earnings and placing a LEAP pipeline in service last summer.  
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment operating were $150 million. This is a $17 million increase from 2019 due to new industrial energy services and RNG projects, offset by steel-related sales.  
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $39 million. This is $9 million higher than last year mainly due to performance in the gas portfolio.  
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $7.19 per share in 2020, which is $0.89 per share higher than 2019.  
Let's move to Slide 12. As Jerry mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance. We would like to remind you that this guidance does not reflect the strategic separation impacts, and any post-transaction guidance will be provided later in the process as we approach the spin date.  
Our 2021 operating EPS guidance range is $6.88 to $7.26 per share. The midpoint of $7.07 per share, which is 7% growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. We are comparing our 2021 guidance to the 2020 original guidance midpoint to normalize the onetime items included in the 2020 actual results given that 2020 was such a unique year.  
Our 2020 results include a number of nonrecurring items, and we experienced higher COVID-related residential electric sales, which are projected to begin to normalize in 2021. These sales were in part offset by the voluntary refund to customers. We also had onetime interest and investment returns, higher Energy Trading earnings, and we experienced higher-than-planned nonutility earnings due to conservative planning and cost control during COVID. We are projecting another strong year in 2021 with growth in each segment.  
At DTE Electric, growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. As we said before, we have worked and continue to work to hold electric base rates flat for our customers. DTE Gas will see continued investment in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements that provide enhanced reliability for our customers. GSP will continue organic growth across all its pipeline and gathering platforms, and continued RNG and cogeneration project development will drive growth at P&I.  
Now let's move to Slide 13 to talk about our long-term growth. The spin transaction unlocks the full potential of our premier regulated utilities and premium natural gas Midstream business. DTE becomes a high-growth, predominantly pure-play, regulated and Michigan-based utility. If you look at our post-spin business, we are growing at 7.4% from our 2020 pro forma operating EPS original guidance midpoint, excluding Midstream impacts.  
In addition, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2025 from the 2020 original guidance despite significant milestones during that time, which includes the conversion of $1.3 billion of mandatory equity units in 2022 and the sunsetting in the REF business at the end of this year. Over 90% of our operating earnings will come from our 2 utilities, which will deliver operating earnings growth in the early years of the plan that are higher than their average operating earnings growth over the 5 years. Overall, we feel optimistic about our outlook and our operational and financial performance.  
Let's turn to Slide 14 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining strong cash flows and solid balance sheet metrics. Due to the strong cash flows in 2020, DTE is targeting the low end of our planned equity issuances in 2021 and continues to have minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We are maintaining our focus on our leverage and cash flow metrics. As we have mentioned before, the spin transaction will be credit-enhancing, allowing us to lower our FFO-to-debt target from 18% to approximately 16% while maintaining a solid credit position.  
We continue to focus on top-tier cash management as we put fast action to ensure strong liquidity at the onset of the pandemic that resulted in having $3.1 billion of available liquidity at the end of last year.  
Now I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open it up for Q&A. As we have demonstrated today, DTE had a very strong year in 2020. And clearly, this is a result of the incredibly hard work of every member of our DTE family. Throughout the year impacted so greatly by the pandemic, we were able to continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. The DTE team achieved remarkable engagement and safety performance. We also were able to assist our customers and communities during the pandemic in unprecedented ways.  
Our DTE team delivered our 12th consecutive year of exceeding our original guidance midpoint while also increasing our dividend and positioning DTE for success in 2021 and into the future.  
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

Yes, that's a very good question and topical in the country right now. So first off, in January, we announced a net zero 2050 target for the Midstream business, with a milestone of getting 30% of the way there by the end of this decade. 
So there's -- there'll be lots of actions that we'll take around that. But I'd say at the very highest level, Steve, there is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the energy infrastructure that carries natural gas. Just to frame it up, it carries about 1/3 of the energy we consume every day in North America. So it's a massive energy distribution system. And just as DTE has successfully decarbonized and is it on our pathway to decarbonize the electric grid, I believe the same opportunity exists for the natural gas energy distribution system. 
So that -- I expect that over time, that's going to take capital investments. And creating the policy framework to enable those capital investments, I think, is important. So I'm kind of pivoting now to the INGAA conversation. And at INGAA, I announced 2 weeks ago a statement on behalf of the industry that the industry is committed to a net zero aspiration by 2050. 
So there's definitely a desire to move in this direction amongst all the industry participants and work closely with the new administration and just societal requirements to move to a lower-carbon footprint. 
So again, I think over time, this is going to create investment opportunities in the infrastructure. And I think the task before us right now is to -- we have a lot of great technology that can be deployed quickly. That's what I'll call on-the-shelf technology, working with the regulators to create the framework to allow that to happen across the industry broadly."

I'm confident that we're going to find some real efficiencies by how we learn to work this year and having more people work remotely.

Somewhere in the -- probably half of what we saw, we're going to be able to -- we look at trying to find ways to continue that on in 2021.

And as I reflected on this past year, I think the best way to characterize my thoughts is pride. And can not be prouder of how our DTE family confronted these challenges and put them head on and create incredible success in every part of our company. I am proud of how our employees responded to ensure their own safety and the safety of our communities while continuing to deliver for our customers.  
DTE also delivered very strong financial results, continuing on an incredible track record of success. In 2020, we achieved extraordinary engagement and safety performance. We achieved our safest year on record. As you all know, the safety of our people and our customers has always been our top priority at DTE. I am so incredibly proud of our team for this achievement while navigating through a pandemic.  
Additionally, our team remained highly engaged throughout the year. We were ranked by Gallup among the top 5% globally for employee engagement, earning our eighth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. Best-in-class employee engagement is our secret sauce that defines our strong work culture and provides a foundation for long-term value creation and repeated success on the delivery of our goals. And as I said, our DTE team stepped up in supporting our customers and communities through these tough times in 2020.  
Our team significantly streamlined payment plans for customers impacted by COVID-19. We found creative ways to shelf rate case filings, which were supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, effectively keeping rates unchanged for customers through 2021. DTE led a $23 million initiative that provided 51,000 tablets as well as Internet access to Detroit  Public School students, assuring that education would not be interrupted.  We also donated over 2 million masks to emergency managers, first responders and hospitals when PPE supplies were low. The DTE Foundation contributed to pandemic-related relief efforts in unprecedented ways in 2020.  
Finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our team worked together to execute our economic response plan to ensure strong financial performance. We quickly analyzed how the pandemic could affect our company, customers and communities and put a plan in place to minimize the impacts. We then followed through and executed on that plan. Our workforce of over 10,000 employees embraced our culture and continuous improvement and found opportunities to increase efficiency across all of our businesses.  This work led to a successful year in 2020 and set DTE up well for the future. I want to congratulate all of our DTE family who delivered one of the best years on many fronts since I have been with the company.  
I'll discuss our 2020 accomplishments on the next slide. As I mentioned, the success of 2020 was fueled by the execution of our economic response plan, which led to really strong earnings. 2020 was also a year of very strong cash flows for DTE, and we were able to use some of that strength to increase investment in our operations, positioning us nicely for 2021.  
Our 2020 operating EPS of $7.19 represents 14% growth over DTE's 2019 operating EPS. This is nearly 9% higher than our original 2020 guidance midpoint. 2020 was the 12th consecutive year we exceeded our original guidance midpoint. This success demonstrates our team's commitment to deliver results and continuous improvement. We also increased our dividend to 7% for 2021, marking the 12th consecutive year of a dividend increase.  
In addition to solid financials, DTE achieved many regulatory and operational successes in 2020. DTE Electric received approval for an innovative onetime voluntary refund to customers for unexpected COVID-19-related sales. This will help maintain our customer affordability and positions DTE Electric to further defer its next rate case filing. We will continue to work on innovative ways to delay rate cases. DTE Gas reached a constructive rate case settlement, which was approved by the MPSC in August. As a result, both utilities achieved regulatory certainty in 2020 that allows us to keep base rate steady for customers through 2021.  
We are very proud of these accomplishments as we continue our commitment to provide reliable, affordable energy to our customers. I will go into more detail on the 2020 achievements for utilities in a few minutes.  Our nonutility businesses also achieved operational successes in 2020. DTE Midstream placed a lead pipeline in service ahead of schedule and under budget and began delivering for our customers, not a small feat in today's environment.  
At P&I, we continue to focus on the development of RNG and cogeneration projects to backfill the sunsetting REF business. In 2020, we operationalized our Wisconsin RNG project and Ford Central Energy Plant and also finalized an additional cogeneration project. This continues our cadence to new private completion, accompanied by a strong pipeline for future growth.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss how DTE is positioned for future success. Overall, our achievements in 2020 have set us up well for continued success in 2021. Our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint of $7.07 provides 7% growth over 2020 original guidance. The vast majority of our growth comes from our utility businesses.  
At DTE Electric, we are investing heavily in the modernization of the grid and cleaner generation. At DTE Gas, we continue our main renewal work as well as infrastructure improvements. We continue our steady growth in our nonutility businesses through strategic and sustainable investments.  
As you know, we are executing the spin of our Midstream business this year. David Slater will give you more details, but let me just say that the transaction is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear.  This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and establishes Midstream as an independent C-corp gas midstream company. We truly believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors of both companies.  
We are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth for DTE from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. It will continue to provide an attractive and growing dividend to investors. DTE has a long track record of delivering premium shareholder returns, consistently beating the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and we plan to continue delivering for our investors. As I said, we have exceeded the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance for 12 straight years. And early in this year, we feel we are well positioned to continue that streak in 2021.  
Turning to Slide 7. I'll highlight some of the successes of DTE Electric. Both utilities progressed on key missions in 2020 while navigating the pandemic. For DTE Electric, that has included clean energy investments as well as investments to accelerate the modernization of our electric grid. In 2020, DTE Electric commissioned a largest wind park in Michigan, which is the Polaris wind park, with 68 turbines generating 168 megawatts of power.  
Our voluntary renewables program, MIGreenPower, continues to exceed our high expectations. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation with 850 megawatts of commitments to date and 25,000 customers enrolled. Enrollment in this program have doubled over the past year. We continue to be excited about this program and see additional opportunity for expansion as the customer enrollments continue to grow. These accomplishments helped DTE Electric work towards this net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.  
DTE Electric also announced its commitment to promote electric vehicles by joining forces and other companies to facilitate the construction of a network of fast-charging stations across the Midwest. To assist our customers with affordability during the pandemic, we found an innovative plan to delay an electric rate case filing. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved this plan, allowing us to provide steady base rates to our customers and regulatory certainty for our company and investors. Commission also approved a onetime customer refund for unexpected load increases from additional residential usage from customers working from home due to COVID-19. This allows us to defer our next rate case even further and keep customer rates steady longer.  
Looking forward, the future is bright for DTE Electric. At the EEI Conference, we rolled forward our 5-year capital plan, which included a 17% increase in capital of the electric company compared to our prior plan. These investments were focused on cleaner energy as well as infrastructure investments for reliability and growth. We're also creating substations for current and future low growth and addressing aging infrastructure  position the grid in the future. Through the implementation of this plan, DTE Electric is targeting 7% to 8% long-term operating earnings growth.  
Moving to Slide 8, I'll describe the successes of DTE Gas. DTE Gas progressed on key initiatives in 2020 and is well positioned for future growth. We announced the innovative program to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This program is a first of its kind and incorporates emission-reduction opportunities for suppliers and customers.  
Recently, we also announced a voluntary program for customers to purchase carbon offsets and renewable natural gas to offset 25% to 100% of the average homes gas use emissions. We progressed on a major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan. This project includes installation of  new pipeline and facility modification work, provide redundancy and mitigate customer outages. We have completed the first of 3 phases for this project, with the second phase scheduled to begin in June.  
DTE Gas also continued man real upgrades and operational improvements in 2020, including completing 206 main renewal miles despite a pause in work during the height of the pandemic and the spring. Finally, DTE Gas achieved a rate case settlement in August that supports investment plans and provides regulatory certainty through 2021.  
The current capital plan for DTE Gas includes additional opportunities that could potentially be included as we continue to find ways to create headroom and affordability with continuous improvement. Our 5-year investment plan of DTE Gas focuses on main renewal, pipeline and transmission integrity and enhanced technology. Upgrading our system and replacing aging infrastructure continues our path for reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.  DTE Gas recently filed a gas rate case with the MPSC in support of these investments in infrastructure and reliability for our customers. With our usual 10-month rate case cycle, new rates will be effective in 2022.  
Before I turn it over to David Slater, who will walk you through the successful year of Midstream ahead and give updates on the spin transaction progress, let me congratulate him on being elected to serve on INGAA Board as Chairman of the industry group representing interstate gas pipelines. 
 David, over to you."

I'll start on Slide 9. As",691,"Thanks, Jerry, for the kind words. The next year will be a defining period for our industry, and I look forward to ensuring that policymakers and regulators understand the importance of natural gas in the lower-carbon future.  
I'll start on Slide 9. As Jerry mentioned earlier, our spin transaction is well underway, and we recently initiated the Form 10 process. This keeps us firmly on schedule for a midyear spin.  
I'll now discuss the success that Midstream achieved across all of our platforms last year and then go over the execution of our spin transaction. 
 We placed the LEAP in service last summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. It is a 155-mile, 36-inch pipeline that extends our gathering system to the Gulf Coast Interstate systems and LNG export markets. This asset is a great addition to our portfolio.  
We delivered strong financial results this year across all of our platforms, producing strong adjusted EBITDA of $713 million, which was above plan. We also executed a 3-year contract on NEXUS with Ohio  utility, and we continue to see strong interest in NEXUS capacity. Overall, portfolio continues to be well contracted. Our major customers are in solid positions, connected to premium markets and have minimal near-term debt maturities.  
I also wanted to mention that Midstream recently announced a net zero emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such a goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets and believe this will evolve to become a significant opportunity over time for Midstream.  
With the position of our assets and the strength of our counterparties and contracts, the Midstream company has highly visible cash flows and a stable long-term outlook. We remain focused on disciplined capital deployment to fuel our growth and are supported by a flexible, well-capitalized balance sheet. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to leverage these positive attributes to further advance the company and create value.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10. The Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade and a solid, steady, strategic transformation has positioned Midstream to become an industry leader it is today. We felt that naming the company DTE Midstream will allow us to build on DTE's legacy of success as we progress on our new journey.  
As I said earlier, the spin is well underway with the expected completion by midyear. We began the SEC Form 10 initial registration process earlier this month. We will be leading with the rating agencies and initiating a debt raise in the second quarter. Throughout this process, we will be hosting events with analysts and investors and are planning to hold a roadshow in June.  
I am feeling very optimistic about our leadership team. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, Bob Skaggs will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. I am pleased to announce that Jeff Jewell, who is currently Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer of DTE Energy, will become the CFO of DTE Midstream. I have worked with Jeff for years, and I can tell you that both Bob and I are delighted to have him join our leadership team. He is a highly qualified expert and has a solid track record of delivering results.  
I am confident that Midstream is well positioned for the future. Our seasoned leadership team, proven track record of success and our unique set of assets will allow us to deliver strong financial results year after year. 2021 will continue this track record with a targeted EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million and a strong capital structure with an initial 4x debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 2x dividend coverage ratio that will provide financial flexibility.  The portfolio generates significant cash flow and is well positioned to create value for our investors. The spin will provide Midstream strategic opportunities and optionality to continue this record of success. And I'm looking forward to talking to many of you between now and the spin completion.  
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."
266598,703432099,2217025,"DTE Energy Company, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financi",1127,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financial results while providing great service for our customers.  
As Jerry mentioned, we executed on our economic response plan to offset the impacts of the pandemic and warm winter weather. With our quick action and the incredible performance from the whole team, we were able to achieve solid financial performance across all of our business units.  
Let me start on Slide 11 to review our year-end financial results. Total operating earnings for the year were $1.4 billion. This translates into $7.19 per share for the year. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.  
I'll start to review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $813 million for the year. This was $97 million higher than 2019 primarily due to higher residential sales from more people working from home during the year and new rate implementation, offset by rate base growth costs.  
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $196 million, $15 million higher than last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by onetime O&M cost savings, new rate implementation and the infrastructure recovery mechanism revenue was offset by warmer-than-normal weather and rate base growth cost.  
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $303 million. This was $90 million higher than last year, with strong performance in each of our platforms driven primarily by a full year of Blue Union earnings and placing a LEAP pipeline in service last summer.  
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment operating were $150 million. This is a $17 million increase from 2019 due to new industrial energy services and RNG projects, offset by steel-related sales.  
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $39 million. This is $9 million higher than last year mainly due to performance in the gas portfolio.  
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $7.19 per share in 2020, which is $0.89 per share higher than 2019.  
Let's move to Slide 12. As Jerry mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance. We would like to remind you that this guidance does not reflect the strategic separation impacts, and any post-transaction guidance will be provided later in the process as we approach the spin date.  
Our 2021 operating EPS guidance range is $6.88 to $7.26 per share. The midpoint of $7.07 per share, which is 7% growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. We are comparing our 2021 guidance to the 2020 original guidance midpoint to normalize the onetime items included in the 2020 actual results given that 2020 was such a unique year.  
Our 2020 results include a number of nonrecurring items, and we experienced higher COVID-related residential electric sales, which are projected to begin to normalize in 2021. These sales were in part offset by the voluntary refund to customers. We also had onetime interest and investment returns, higher Energy Trading earnings, and we experienced higher-than-planned nonutility earnings due to conservative planning and cost control during COVID. We are projecting another strong year in 2021 with growth in each segment.  
At DTE Electric, growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. As we said before, we have worked and continue to work to hold electric base rates flat for our customers. DTE Gas will see continued investment in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements that provide enhanced reliability for our customers. GSP will continue organic growth across all its pipeline and gathering platforms, and continued RNG and cogeneration project development will drive growth at P&I.  
Now let's move to Slide 13 to talk about our long-term growth. The spin transaction unlocks the full potential of our premier regulated utilities and premium natural gas Midstream business. DTE becomes a high-growth, predominantly pure-play, regulated and Michigan-based utility. If you look at our post-spin business, we are growing at 7.4% from our 2020 pro forma operating EPS original guidance midpoint, excluding Midstream impacts.  
In addition, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2025 from the 2020 original guidance despite significant milestones during that time, which includes the conversion of $1.3 billion of mandatory equity units in 2022 and the sunsetting in the REF business at the end of this year. Over 90% of our operating earnings will come from our 2 utilities, which will deliver operating earnings growth in the early years of the plan that are higher than their average operating earnings growth over the 5 years. Overall, we feel optimistic about our outlook and our operational and financial performance.  
Let's turn to Slide 14 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining strong cash flows and solid balance sheet metrics. Due to the strong cash flows in 2020, DTE is targeting  the low end of our planned equity issuances in 2021 and continues to have minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We are maintaining our focus on our leverage and cash flow metrics.  As we have mentioned before, the spin transaction will be credit-enhancing, allowing us to lower our FFO-to-debt target from 18% to approximately 16% while maintaining a solid credit position.  
We continue to focus on top-tier cash management as we put fast action to ensure strong liquidity at the onset of the pandemic that resulted in having $3.1 billion of available liquidity at the end of last year.  
Now I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open it up for Q&A. As we have demonstrated today, DTE had a very strong year in 2020. And clearly, this is a result of the incredibly hard work of every member of our DTE family. Throughout the year impacted so greatly by the pandemic, we were able to continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. The DTE team achieved remarkable engagement and safety performance. We also were able to assist our customers and communities during the pandemic in unprecedented ways.  
Our DTE team delivered our 12th consecutive year of exceeding our original guidance midpoint while also increasing our dividend and positioning DTE for success in 2021 and into the future.  
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

So yes, first off, our Midstream assets performed really well. I'm proud of the operating team in the field. They saw that weather coming in and started to take actions in advance of that to make sure our system operated reliably, so it has. 
We have seen from a customer/producer perspective well freeze-offs, and it's really driven by an extended period of very frigid weather in the Louisiana, Texas area. And that, over time, does affect production. That said, it looks like the weather is breaking today and tomorrow. We expect that those volumes will come back online over the weekend and into the beginning of next week. 
So there has been a short-term production reduction that occurred and -- but it's going to be bouncing back fairly quickly."

And the Midstream, as David mentioned, we'll have a dividend that's said to a dividend coverage ratio of approximately 2x the distributable cash flow.

So there's -- there'll be lots of actions that we'll take around that. But I'd say at the very highest level, Steve, there is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the energy infrastructure that carries natural gas. Just to frame it up, it carries about 1/3 of the energy we consume every day in North America. So it's a massive energy distribution system. And just as DTE has successfully decarbonized and is it on our pathway to decarbonize the electric grid, I believe the same opportunity exists for the natural gas energy distribution system. 
So that -- I expect that over time, that's going to take capital investments. And creating the policy framework to enable those capital investments, I think, is important. So I'm kind of pivoting now to the INGAA conversation. And at INGAA, I announced 2 weeks ago a statement on behalf of the industry that the industry is committed to a net zero aspiration by 2050. 
So there's definitely a  desire to move in this direction amongst all the industry participants and work closely with the new administration and just societal requirements to move to a lower-carbon footprint. 
 So again, I think over time, this is going to create investment opportunities in the infrastructure. And I think the task before us right now is to -- we have a lot of great technology that can be deployed quickly. That's what I'll call on-the-shelf  technology, working with the regulators to create the framework to allow that to happen across the industry broadly."

We have more people working capital, and we had some delays in some of our work due to COVID. But some of the things will be real and will stay with us. I'm confident that we're going to find some real efficiencies by how we learn to work this year and having more people work remotely. And so we're going to be able to take a lot of what we learned and roll that forward. 
Somewhere in the -- probably half of what we saw, we're going to be able to -- we look at trying to find ways to continue that on in 2021. 
And then continued cost savings. Again, as Jerry said, so that we can have more room for additional capital that we need to help serve our customers."

So let's start on Slide 4. 2020 was clearly a challenging year for so many with the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting everyone's lives. And as I reflected on this past year, I think the best way to characterize my thoughts is pride. I cannot be prouder of how our DTE family confronted these challenges and put them head on and created incredible success in every part of our company. I am proud of how our employees responded to ensure their own safety and the safety of our communities while continuing to deliver for our customers.  
DTE also delivered very strong financial results, continuing our incredible track record of success. In 2020, we achieved extraordinary engagement and safety performance. We achieved our safest year on record. As you all know, the safety of our people and our customers has always been our top priority at DTE. I am so incredibly proud of our team for this achievement while navigating through a pandemic.  
Additionally, our team remained highly engaged throughout the year. We were ranked by Gallup among the top 5% globally for employee engagement, earning our eighth consecutive Gallup Great Workplace Award. Best-in-class employee engagement is our secret sauce that defines our strong corporate culture and provides a foundation for long-term value creation and repeated success on the delivery of our goals. And as I said, our DTE team stepped up and supported our customers and communities through these tough times in 2020.  
  
  
Our team significantly streamlined payment plans for customers impacted by COVID-19. We found creative ways to shelf rate case filings, which were supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, effectively keeping rates unchanged for customers through 2021. DTE led a $23 million initiative that provided 51,000 tablets as well as Internet access to Detroit Public School students, assuring that education would not be interrupted. We also donated over 2 million masks to emergency managers, first responders and hospitals when PPE supplies were low. The DTE Foundation contributed to pandemic-related relief efforts in unprecedented ways in 2020.  
  Finally, I'm incredibly proud of how our team worked together to execute our economic response plan to ensure strong financial performance. We quickly analyzed how the pandemic could affect our company, customers and communities and put a plan in place to minimize the impacts. We then followed through and executed on that plan. Our workforce of over 10,000 employees embraced our culture and continuous improvement and found opportunities to increase efficiency across all of our businesses. This work led to a successful year in 2020 and set DTE up well for the future. I want to congratulate all of our DTE family who delivered one of the best years on many fronts since I have been with the company.  
I'll discuss our 2020 accomplishments on the next slide. As I mentioned, the success of 2020 was fueled by the execution of our economic response plan, which led to really strong earnings. 2020 was also a year of very strong cash flows for DTE, and we were able to use some of that strength to increase investment in our operations, positioning us nicely for 2021.  
Our 2020 operating EPS of $7.19 represents 14% growth over DTE's 2019 operating EPS. This is nearly 9% higher than our original 2020 guidance midpoint. 2020 was the 12th consecutive year we exceeded our original guidance midpoint. This success demonstrates our team's commitment to deliver results and continuous improvement. We also increased our dividend to 7% for 2021, marking the 12th consecutive year of a dividend increase.  
  
  In addition to solid financials, DTE achieved many regulatory and operational successes in 2020. DTE Electric received approval for an innovative onetime voluntary refund to customers for unexpected COVID-19-related sales. This will help maintain our customer affordability and positions DTE Electric to further defer its next rate case filing. We will continue to work on innovative ways to delay rate cases. DTE Gas reached a constructive rate case settlement, which was approved by the MPSC in August. As a result, both utilities achieved regulatory certainty in 2020 that allows us to keep base rates steady for customers through 2021.  
We are very proud of these accomplishments as we continue our commitment to provide reliable, affordable energy to our customers. I will go into more detail on the 2020 achievements for utilities in a few minutes. Our nonutility businesses also achieved operational successes in 2020. DTE Midstream placed a lead pipeline in service ahead of schedule and under budget and began delivering for our customers, not a small feat in today's environment.  
At P&I, we continue to focus on the development of RNG and cogeneration projects to backfill the sunsetting REF business. In 2020, we operationalized our Wisconsin RNG project and Ford Central Energy Plant and also finalized an additional cogeneration project. This continues our cadence to new private completion, accompanied by a strong pipeline for future growth.  
Turning to Slide 6. I'll discuss how DTE is positioned for future success. Overall, our achievements in 2020 have set us up well for continued success in 2021. Our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint of $7.07 provides 7% growth over 2020 original guidance. The vast majority of our growth comes from our utility businesses.  
At DTE Electric, we are investing heavily in the modernization of the grid and cleaner generation. At DTE Gas, we continue our main renewal work as well as infrastructure improvements. We continue our steady growth in our nonutility businesses through strategic and sustainable investments.  
As you know, we are executing the spin of our Midstream business this year. David Slater will give you more details, but let me just say that the transaction is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and establishes Midstream as an independent C-corp gas midstream company. We truly believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors of both companies.  
We are reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth for DTE from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. It will continue to provide an attractive and growing dividend to investors. DTE has a long track record of delivering premium shareholder returns, consistently beating the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and we plan to continue delivering for our investors. As I said, we have exceeded the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance for 12 straight years. And early in this year, we feel we are well positioned to continue that streak in 2021.  
Turning to Slide 7. I'll highlight some of the successes of DTE Electric. Both utilities progressed on key missions in 2020 while navigating the pandemic. For DTE Electric, that has included clean energy investments as well as investments to accelerate the modernization of our electric grid. In 2020, DTE Electric commissioned the largest wind park in Michigan, which is the Polaris wind park, with 68 turbines generating 168 megawatts of power.  
Our voluntary renewables program, MIGreenPower, continues to exceed our high expectations. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation with 850 megawatts of commitments to date and 25,000 customers enrolled. Enrollment in this program have doubled over the past year. We continue to be excited about this program and see additional opportunity for expansion as the customer enrollments continue to grow. These accomplishments helped DTE Electric work towards this net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.  
DTE Electric also announced its commitment to promote electric vehicles by joining forces and other companies to facilitate the construction of a network of fast-charging stations across the Midwest. To assist our customers with affordability during the pandemic, we filed an innovative plan to delay an electric rate case filing. The Michigan Public Service Commission approved this plan, allowing us to provide steady base rates to our customers and regulatory certainty for our company and investors. Commission also approved a onetime customer refund for unexpected load increases from additional residential usage from customers working from home due to COVID-19. This allows us to defer our next rate case even further and keep customer rates steady longer.  
Looking forward, the future is bright for DTE Electric. At the EEI Conference, we rolled forward our 5-year capital plan, which included a 17% increase in capital of the electric company compared to our prior plan. These investments were focused on cleaner energy as well as infrastructure investments for reliability and growth. We're also creating substations for current and future load growth and addressing aging infrastructure position the grid in the future. Through the implementation of this plan, DTE Electric is targeting 7% to 8% long-term operating earnings growth.  
Moving to Slide 8, I'll describe the successes of DTE Gas. DTE Gas progressed on key initiatives in 2020 and is well positioned for future growth. We announced the innovative program to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This program is a first of its kind and incorporates emission-reduction opportunities for suppliers and customers.  
Recently, we also announced a voluntary program for customers to purchase carbon offsets and renewable natural gas to offset 25% to 100% of the average homes' gas use emissions. We progressed on a major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan. This project includes installation of new pipeline and facility modification work, provide redundancy and mitigate customer outages. We have completed the first of 3 phases for this project, with the second phase scheduled to begin in June.  
DTE Gas also continued main renewal upgrades and operational improvements in 2020, including completing 206 main renewal miles despite a pause in work during the height of the pandemic and the spring. Finally, DTE Gas achieved a rate case settlement in August that supports investment plans and provides regulatory certainty through 2021.  
The current capital plan for DTE Gas includes additional opportunities that could potentially be included as we continue to find ways to create headroom and affordability with continuous improvement. Our 5-year investment plan of DTE Gas focuses on main renewal, pipeline and transmission integrity and enhanced technology. Upgrading our system and replacing aging infrastructure continues our path for reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. DTE Gas recently filed a gas rate case with the MPSC in support of these investments in infrastructure and reliability for our customers. With our usual 10-month rate case cycle, new rates will be effective in 2022.  
Before I turn it over to David Slater, who will walk you through the successful year of Midstream ahead and give updates on the spin transaction progress, let me congratulate him on being elected to serve on the INGAA Board as Chairman of the industry group representing interstate gas pipelines. 
David, over to you."

I'll start on Slide 9. As",692,"Thanks, Jerry, for the kind words. The next year will be a defining period for our industry, and I look forward to ensuring that policymakers and regulators understand the importance of natural gas in the lower-carbon future.  
I'll start on Slide 9. As Jerry mentioned earlier, our spin transaction is well underway, and we recently initiated the Form 10 process. This keeps us firmly on schedule for a midyear spin.  
I'll now discuss the success that Midstream achieved across all of our platforms last year and then go over the execution of our spin transaction. 
We placed the LEAP in service last summer, ahead of schedule and under budget. It is a 155-mile, 36-inch pipeline that extends our gathering system to the Gulf Coast Interstate systems and LNG export markets. This asset is a great addition to our portfolio.  
We delivered strong financial results this year across all of our platforms, producing strong adjusted EBITDA of $713 million, which was above plan. We also executed a 3-year contract on NEXUS with our Ohio utility, and we continue to see strong interest in NEXUS capacity. Overall, portfolio continues to be well contracted. Our major customers are in solid positions, connected to premium markets and have minimal near-term debt maturities.  
I also wanted to mention that Midstream recently announced a net zero emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such a goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets and believe this will evolve to become a significant opportunity over time for Midstream.  
With the position of our assets and the strength of our counterparties and contracts, the Midstream company has highly visible cash flows and a stable long-term outlook. We remain focused on disciplined capital deployment to fuel our growth and are supported by a flexible, well-capitalized balance sheet. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to leverage these positive attributes to further advance the company and create value.  
Now let's turn to Slide 10. The Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade and a solid, steady, strategic transformation has positioned Midstream to become an industry leader it is today. We felt that naming the company DTE Midstream will allow us to build on DTE's legacy of success as we progress on our new journey.  
As I said earlier, the spin is well underway with the expected completion by midyear. We began the SEC Form 10 initial registration process earlier this month. We will be leading with the rating agencies and initiating a debt raise in the second quarter. Throughout this process, we will be hosting events with analysts and investors and are planning to hold a roadshow in June.  
I am feeling very optimistic about our leadership team. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, Bob Skaggs will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. I am pleased to announce that Jeff Jewell, who is currently Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer of DTE Energy, will become the CFO of DTE Midstream. I have worked with Jeff for years, and I can tell you that both Bob and I are delighted to have him join our leadership team. He is a highly qualified expert and has a solid track record of delivering results.  
I am confident that Midstream is well positioned for the future. Our seasoned leadership team, proven track record of success and our unique set of assets will allow us to deliver strong financial results year after year. 2021 will continue this track record with a targeted EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million and a strong capital structure with an initial 4x debt-to-EBITDA ratio and a 2x dividend coverage ratio that will provide financial flexibility. The portfolio generates significant cash flow and is well positioned to create value for our investors. The spin will provide Midstream strategic opportunities and optionality to continue this record of success. And I'm looking forward to talking to many of you between now and the spin completion.  
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."
266598,703432099,2256704,"DTE Energy Company, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financi",1127,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was the year that brought its share of opportunities and challenges, and hard work of our employees allowed us to continue to deliver for our stakeholders, including delivering strong operational and financial results while providing great service for our customers.  
As Jerry mentioned, we executed on our economic response plan to offset the impacts of the pandemic and warm winter weather. With our quick action and the incredible performance from the whole team, we were able to achieve solid financial performance across all of our business units.  
Let me start on Slide 11 to review our year-end financial results. Total operating earnings for the year were $1.4 billion. This translates into $7.19 per share for the year. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix.  
I'll start to review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $813 million for the year. This was $97 million higher than 2019 primarily due to higher residential sales from more people working from home during the year and new rate implementation, offset by rate base growth costs.  
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $196 million, $15 million higher than last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by onetime O&M cost savings, new rate implementation and the infrastructure recovery mechanism revenue was offset by warmer-than-normal weather and rate base growth cost.  
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $303 million. This was $90 million higher than last year, with strong performance in each of our platforms driven primarily by a full year of Blue Union earnings and placing a LEAP pipeline in service last summer.  
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment operating were $150 million. This is a $17 million increase from 2019 due to new industrial energy services and RNG projects, offset by steel-related sales.  
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $39 million. This is $9 million higher than last year mainly due to performance in the gas portfolio.  
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable by $4 million year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $7.19 per share in 2020, which is $0.89 per share higher than 2019.  
Let's move to Slide 12. As Jerry mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance. We would like to remind you that this guidance does not reflect the strategic separation impacts, and any post-transaction guidance will be provided later in the process as we approach the spin date.  
Our 2021 operating EPS guidance range is $6.88 to $7.26 per share. The midpoint of $7.07 per share, which is 7% growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. We are comparing our 2021 guidance to the 2020 original guidance midpoint to normalize the onetime items included in the 2020 actual results given that 2020 was such a unique year.  
Our 2020 results include a number of nonrecurring items, and we experienced higher COVID-related residential electric sales, which are projected to begin to normalize in 2021. These sales were in part offset by the voluntary refund to customers. We also had onetime interest and investment returns, higher Energy Trading earnings, and we experienced higher-than-planned nonutility earnings due to conservative planning and cost control during COVID. We are projecting another strong year in 2021 with growth in each segment.  
At DTE Electric, growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. As we said before, we have worked and continue to work to hold electric base rates flat for our customers. DTE Gas will see continued investment in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements that provide enhanced reliability for our customers. GSP will continue organic growth across all its pipeline and gathering platforms, and continued RNG and cogeneration project development will drive growth at P&I.  
Now let's move to Slide 13 to talk about our long-term growth. The spin transaction unlocks the full potential of our premier regulated utilities and premium natural gas Midstream business. DTE becomes a high-growth, predominantly pure-play, regulated and Michigan-based utility. If you look at our post-spin business, we are growing at 7.4% from our 2020 pro forma operating EPS original guidance midpoint, excluding Midstream impacts.  
In addition, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2025 from the 2020 original guidance despite significant milestones during that time, which includes the conversion of $1.3 billion of mandatory equity units in 2022 and the sunsetting in the REF business at the end of this year. Over 90% of our operating earnings will come from our 2 utilities, which will deliver operating earnings growth in the early years of the plan that are higher than their average operating earnings growth over the 5 years. Overall, we feel optimistic about our outlook and our operational and financial performance.  
Let's turn to Slide 14 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining strong cash flows and solid balance sheet metrics. Due to the strong cash flows in 2020, DTE is targeting the low end of our planned equity issuances in 2021 and continues to have minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We are maintaining our focus on our leverage and cash flow metrics. As we have mentioned before, the spin transaction will be credit-enhancing, allowing us to lower our FFO-to-debt target from 18% to approximately 16% while maintaining a solid credit position.  
We continue to focus on top-tier cash management as we put fast action to ensure strong liquidity at the onset of the pandemic that resulted in having $3.1 billion of available liquidity at the end of last year.  
Now I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open it up for Q&A. As we have demonstrated today, DTE had a very strong year in 2020. And clearly, this is a result of the incredibly hard work of every member of our DTE family. Throughout the year impacted so greatly by the pandemic, we were able to continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers. The DTE team achieved remarkable engagement and safety performance. We also were able to assist our customers and communities during the pandemic in unprecedented ways.  
Our DTE team delivered our 12th consecutive year of exceeding our original guidance midpoint while also increasing our dividend and positioning DTE for success in 2021 and into the future.  
  With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

And the Midstream, as David mentioned, we'll have a dividend that's said to a dividend coverage ratio of approximately 2x the distributable cash flow.

So first off, in January, we announced a net zero 2050 target for the Midstream business, with a milestone of getting 30% of the way there by the end of this decade. 
So there's -- there'll be lots of actions that we'll take around that. But I'd say at the very highest level, Steve, there is a significant opportunity to decarbonize the energy infrastructure that carries natural gas. Just to frame it up, it carries about 1/3 of the energy we consume every day in North America. So it's a massive energy distribution system. And just as DTE has successfully decarbonized and is it on our pathway to decarbonize the electric grid, I believe the same opportunity exists for the natural gas energy distribution system. 
So that -- I expect that over time, that's going to take capital investments. And creating the policy framework to enable those capital investments, I think, is important. So I'm kind of pivoting now to the INGAA conversation. And at INGAA, I announced 2 weeks ago a statement on behalf of the industry that the industry is committed to a net zero aspiration by 2050. 
So there's definitely a desire to move in this direction amongst all the industry participants and work closely with the new administration and just societal requirements to move to a lower-carbon footprint. 
So again, I think over time, this is going to create investment opportunities in the infrastructure. And I think the task before us right now is to -- we have a lot of great technology that can be deployed quickly. That's what I'll call on-the-shelf technology, working with the regulators to create the framework to allow that to happen across the industry broadly."

But certainly, the success that we expect in 2021 is driven by some of the work that we did in 2020 as it relates to the cost reductions and also strengthens our plan long term. As you saw at EEI, we pulled forward $2 billion of investments into the electric business in order to accelerate our modernization program for the electric grid. That was a result of a lot of the learnings that we experienced in 2020. Now some of those cost reductions are onetime in nature, and I'll let Dave Ruud describe some of those as well."

As we look at the initiatives we implement in 2020, our goal is going to be to keep as much of that going forward as we can. We consistently have, through our normal processes, always looking at costs. But in 2020, we did see some additional reductions. Some of those, of course, are onetime. We have more people working capital, and we had some delays in some of our work due to COVID. But some of the things will be real and will stay with us. I'm confident that we're going to find some real efficiencies by how we learn to work this year and having more people work remotely. And so we're going to be able to take a lot of what we learned and roll that forward. 
Somewhere in the -- probably half of what we saw, we're going to be able to -- we look at trying to find ways to continue that on in 2021. 
And then continued cost savings. Again, as Jerry said, so that we can have more room for additional capital that we need to help serve our customers."

Dave Ruud will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. 
So let's start on Slide 1. As we have discussed before, our priorities at DTE are to support our employees, customers, and community, which then enables us to provide the strong consistent growth investors have come to expect. Our focus this quarter was no different as we have delivered for all of our stakeholders. Our team at DTE has continued to perform at a very high level. We were recently recognized by Gallup as a great workplace. This is the ninth consecutive year we have received this award. We're off to an extremely safe start in 2021, coming off our safest year ever in 2020. 
As I have said, safety is our top priority at DTE, and getting people home safely to their families every day helps drive our success and employee engagement. We are building in our diversity, equity and inclusion focus with employees fully dedicated to helping the company on this journey. DTE is committed to accelerating our progression towards a workplace where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. We do understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included, safe and welcome. 
On the customer front, we continue to deliver safe and reliable energy. Just recently, DTE Electric received approval on its deferral request that delays next rate case filing until October 2021. This provides price stability for our customers, keeping base rates steady through 2021 and into 2022. As you recall, we previously received approval to delay a general rate until May. And this order extends to delay at least 5 additional months. This is another step towards stabilizing our customer affordability. Additionally, DTE is ranked as one of the top 10 utilities in the nation for energy efficiency and customer savings, and J.D. Power has ranked both our electric and gas utility at top quartile for residential customer satisfaction. These initiatives and recognitions show our continued commitment to service excellence. 
Supporting the communities where we live and serve remains critically important to us. DTE helped thousands of all of our customers lower their energy bills in 2020 and while significantly reducing natural gas and electricity usage through energy efficiency initiatives. Our energy efficiency assistance this program was recognized for keeping energy affordable for our most in need customers. We recently contributed to Habitat for Humanity and supported their effort to weather-proof low-income homes. DTE also led a fundraising to help small business in Detroit pass the pandemic. We are also offering personal protective equipment, technical assistance and opening resources to assist small businesses across the city. With engaged employees, customers are satisfied with and communities that are resilient, we deliver value for our investors. 
We delivered a strong first quarter with earnings of $2.44 per share and solid performances across all our business lines. [Audio Gap] operating EPS growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. The Midstream spend is on track for midyear completion. The spin positions DTE Energy as a predominantly pure-play best-in-class utility. With significant capital investments of $19 billion over the next 5 years 90% of that will go into our utilities. And we continue to target our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate with 2020 original guidance as the base for that growth. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent natural gas midstream company with assets in premium basins, and accretive growth opportunities. 
On the next slide, I will discuss some of our major accomplishments from the first quarter. DTE is continuing to focus on our environmental initiatives. DTE Electric's recently placed 3 wind parks in service, Isabella 1 and 2, which are the largest wind parks in Michigan, have a total of 136 turbines with 383 megawatts of capacity. We also placed the Fairbank's wind park in service with a capacity of 72 megawatts. DTE now has nearly 1,800 megawatts of capacity from renewable energy sources, enough to power 670,000 Michigan homes. This is a significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. The electric company recently filed a settlement agreement for voluntary renewables. The settlement includes 800 megawatts of renewable power additions, with 420 of that being slated for 2022, and the remaining 380 megawatts coming online in 2023 through 2025. These sources will support the voluntary renewable program, MIGreenPower, which continues to exceed our high expectations. We recently announced the commitment of a few new companies to the MIGreenPower program, including the state of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health. We have reached 900 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and approximately 30,000 residential customers. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation and helps advance our work towards a net 0 carbon emissions goal. 
The electric company also received approval in the Michigan Public Service Commission for Phase 2 of its charging forward initiative to strengthen electric vehicle infrastructure in the State of Michigan. This includes customer education and outreach, fleet advisory services and charging infrastructure components to further support electrification transition of fleet vehicles. At the end of March, the electric company completed its most recent offering of green bonds. The $1 billion bond offering will help fund the development and construction of solar wind farms including transmission infrastructure to support renewable energy facilities. The funding will also strengthen energy efficiency programs to help Michigan residents and businesses save energy and reduce their bills. DTE Electric has issued 3 green bonds over the past 4 years for a total of $2 billion. These bonds help support our progress towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 
DTE Gas announced CleanVision Natural Gas Balance, the nation's first program to include both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas for customers to reduce their carbon footprint. This program offers 4 levels of participation for customers, ranging from $4 a month to offset 25% of an average home's gas use emissions, to $16 a month to offset 100% of our carbon footprint. The carbon reduction goals are achieved with Michigan forest preservation and renewable natural gas. By helping to preserve Michigan's forest through this program, DTE customers not only support the removal of greenhouse gases, but also preserve one of Michigan's greatest natural assets. Recently, DTE Gas executed a 7-year agreement to secure 4 3 carbon offsets to be used for this program. 
As for RNG, landfill emissions and wastewater treatment planned byproducts are transformed in the fuel that heat's homes and power's businesses and cars. We're excited to invite customers to be part of our ambitious vision to create a cleaner energy future. The program is off to a strong start with over 2,400 customers signed up to reduce their carbon footprint. Our Midstream company also announced its own 2050 net 0 carbon emissions goal just earlier this year. Climate change is one of the defining public policy issues of our time. And I'm proud that this business is joining our electric and gas utilities and the effort to deliver cleaner energy. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. I will discuss DTE’s solid start in 2021. Our first quarter financial results were strong, giving us even greater confidence in our 2021 financial plan, which could create investment opportunities later in the year. DTE earned $2.44 per share this quarter, up $0.78 from last year. And so with 1 quarter behind us, I am confident that DTE is well positioned to deliver our financial plans this year and setting up well for success in 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we'll continue to target a 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate to 2020 original guidance as the base. We continue to focus on our balance sheet, with strong cash flows and solid credit metrics. The spin-off of the Midstream business is on track for midyear execution. Our team is working diligently to make that happen, and I thank them for their efforts. As you know, this spin positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility, with 90% of DTE’s total operating earnings coming from our 2 regulated businesses. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent, well financed gas Midstream C-Corp with accretive organic growth opportunities. Just as DTE is well positioned to deliver for investors, this new independent Midstream company will also be positioned for success with a strong asset base and 2 of the most prolific dry gas basins in the country. The spin is progressing very well, with the Form 10 filing and its standard review process with the SEC and an event road show planned for the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to David Slater for updates on the midstream business and the spin transaction progress."

Our Midstream businesses had a solid first quarter, executing well across all platforms and assets. We are on track to achieve our financial targets in 2021, which include an EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million. DTM is also committed to a world-class ESG agenda. Earlier this year, we announced a net 0 emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the Midstream sector to announce such goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets, and we believe this will evolve to become a significant business opportunity over time for DTM. Additionally, DTM is establishing a Board of Directors committed to ensuring the company operates in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
As Jerry mentioned, we are on track for a mid-year spin execution. Our Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade. And the solid, steady and strategic transformation has positioned this segment to become the industry leader it is today. The creation of an independent Midstream C-Corp will provide the opportunity to further advance the company and create value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. The spin is on track for a midyear execution. We initiated the Form 10 process with the SEC back in February. Since then, we have been diligently working through the period. And this has been going smoothly as expected. In March, we held discussions with the rating agencies, which went very well. We will be receiving a credit rating at the time of our debt rates. The Form 10 will be public in the second quarter. We plan to hold an investor roadshow later in the second quarter as well. DTM shares are expected to start trading on a issued basis 1 or 2 weeks before DTM shares begin regular way trading on the New York Stock exchange upon closing. 
Finally, the spin transaction will be executed midyear. As Jerry mentioned, successfully executing the spin has been made possible by the commitment and dedication of all of our employees. Thank you to our team for bringing their best energy to work each day and keeping everything on track. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE’s financial performance."
266598,711189511,2258962,"DTE Energy Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by",726,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. 
I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $208 million for the quarter. This was $114 million higher than the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. DTE Electric also experienced nonqualified benefit plan losses in the first quarter of 2020. We have since taken measures to reduce market variability in these plans, so we'll no longer see this variability after the second quarter of 2020. If you remember, in the second quarter of 2020, the benefit plan losses reversed and were positive in that quarter. 
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $169 million, $48 million higher than first quarter last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. Let's keep moving down the page to our gas storage and pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $14 million higher than first quarter 2020 driven primarily by the lead pipeline going into service in the second half of 2020. On the next row, you can see our power and industrial business segment operating earnings were $28 million. This was a $2 million decrease from first quarter last year due to steel-related earnings, offset by new RNG projects. On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our energy trading business were $14 million, which is consistent with first quarter earnings last year. This quarter, strong performance in the gas portfolio was offset by performance in the power portfolio, both which occurred during the period of extremely cold weather in Texas in the first quarter. Together, this positioned us slightly positive to our expectation for the quarter. 
Finally, corporate and other was unfavorable $21 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the timing of taxes and net change in interest. Overall, DTE earned $2.44 per share in the first quarter of 2021, which is $0.78 per share higher than 2020. I'd like to note that much of this favorability versus 2020 was anticipated in our plan. However, some of the favorability is due to DTE Electric, GSP and energy trading performing better than planned. This is positioning us well for 2021, we should have the opportunity to further invest in O&M initiatives that can improve reliability for our customers, which will also further strengthen our financial plans for 2022 in future years. 
Now moving on to Slide 10. I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open up for Q&A. In summary, we feel great about our first quarter results. We are on track to continue to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. The spin of our Midstream business is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and will establish DTM as an independent gas-focused midstream company with accretive growth opportunities. We believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors of both companies. Our utilities continue to focus on necessary customer-focused infrastructure investments, specifically investments in clean generation, and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our team deployed many innovative strategies to provide regulatory certainty during what continues to be a challenging time for many of our customers. This will enable DTE to maintain steady base rates through 2021. We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. DTE is targeting minimal equity issuances in 2021 and we continue to have minimal equity needs in our plan besides the convertible equity units in 2022. And we have maintained our solid dividend growth with a 7% dividend increase in 2021. 
In closing, as we approach the spin of our midstream business, DTE is well positioned to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade. With that, I thank you for joining us today. And we can open up the line for questions."

So it's a unique way of packaging carbon offsets through RNG as well as forestry products to deliver a lower carbon footprint for our customers. I do see that expanding across the country, Michael. Right now, most of our efforts in RNG at DTE Energy and our P&I business are focused on  gas going into the California markets, which gives us very nice returns, both from our renewable fuel standard as well as the low carbon fuel standard in California, we get as I've mentioned in prior calls, returns where we see our simple cash payback happen in 3 to 4 years with pretty modest investments.

It was still a little negative, but it was better than last year. And also at DTE Electric, that's where we had those benefit plans that you mentioned. And that was about the $20 million to $25 million difference that we had a loss last quarter. Of course, that's going to be a gain in second quarter of 2020. And then we've since taken all the actions to make sure we don't see that market credibility again. As far as gas, again, in the first quarter of 2020, we had really negative weather. That's what we were trying to come back from throughout the year. So we had better weather this year. And then the rest of the upside that we would see would be from the new rates coming into effect."

Dave Ruud will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. 
So let's start on Slide 1. As we have discussed before, our priorities at DTE are to support our employees, customers, and community, which then enables us to provide the strong, consistent growth investors have come to expect. Our focus this quarter was no different as we have delivered for all of our stakeholders. 
Our team at DTE has continued to perform at a very high level. We were recently recognized by Gallup as a great workplace. This is the ninth consecutive year we have received this award. We're off to an extremely safe start in 2021, coming off our safest year ever in 2020. 
As I have said, safety is our top priority at DTE, and getting people home safely to their families every day helps drive our success and employee engagement. We are building on our diversity, equity and inclusion focus with employees fully dedicated to helping the company on this journey. DTE is committed to accelerating our progression towards a workplace where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. We do understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included, safe and welcome. 
On the customer front, we continue to deliver safe and reliable energy. Just recently, DTE Electric received approval on its deferral request that delays next rate case filing until October 2021. This provides price stability for our customers, keeping base rates steady through 2021 and into 2022. As you'll recall, we previously received approval to delay a general rate until May. And this order extends the delay at least 5 additional months. This is another step towards stabilizing our customer affordability. 
Additionally, DTE is ranked as one of the top 10 utilities in the nation for energy efficiency and customer savings, and J.D. Power has ranked both our electric and gas utility at top quartile for residential customer satisfaction. These initiatives and recognitions show our continued commitment to service excellence. 
Supporting the communities where we live and serve remains critically important to us. DTE helped thousands of vulnerable customers lower their energy bills in 2020 while significantly reducing natural gas and electricity usage through energy efficiency initiatives. Our energy efficiency assistance program was recognized for keeping energy affordable for our most in-need customers. 
We recently contributed to Habitat for Humanity and supported their effort to weather-proof low-income homes. DTE also led a fundraising effort to help small business in Detroit go past the pandemic. We are also offering personal protective equipment, technical assistance and opening resources to assist small businesses across the city. With engaged employees, customers are satisfied with [indiscernible] and communities that are resilient. We deliver value for our investors. 
We delivered a strong first quarter with earnings of $2.44 per share and solid performances across all our business lines.
[Audio Gap] 
operating EPS growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. 
The Midstream spin is on track for midyear completion. The spin positions DTE Energy as a predominantly pure-play best-in-class utility. With significant capital investments of $19 billion over the next 5 years, 90% of that will go into our utilities. And we continue to target our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate with 2020 original guidance as the base for that growth. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent natural gas midstream company with assets in premium basins and accretive growth opportunities. 
On the next slide, I will discuss some of our major accomplishments from the first quarter. DTE has continued to focus on our environmental initiatives. DTE Electric has recently placed 3 wind parks in service. Isabella I and II, which are the largest wind parks in Michigan, have a total of 136 turbines with 383 megawatts of capacity. We also placed the Fairbanks Wind park in service with a capacity of 72 megawatts. DTE now has nearly 1,800 megawatts of capacity from renewable energy sources, enough to power 670,000 Michigan homes. This is a significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. 
The electric company recently filed a settlement agreement for voluntary renewables. The settlement includes 800 megawatts of renewable power additions, with 420 of that being slated for 2022 and the remaining 380 megawatts coming online in 2023 through 2025. These sources will support the voluntary renewable program, MIGreenPower, which continues to exceed our high expectations. We recently announced the commitment of a few new companies to the MIGreenPower program, including the state of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health. We have reached 900 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and approximately 30,000 residential customers. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation and helps advance our work towards a net zero carbon emissions goal. 
The electric company also received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission for Phase 2 of its Charging Forward initiative to strengthen electric vehicle infrastructure in the state of Michigan. This includes customer education and outreach, fleet advisory services and charging infrastructure components to further support electrification transition of fleet vehicles. 
At the end of March, the electric company completed its most recent offering of green bonds. The $1 billion bond offering will help fund the development and construction of solar wind farms, including transmission infrastructure to support renewable energy facilities. The funding will also strengthen energy efficiency programs to help Michigan residents and businesses save energy and reduce their bills. DTE Electric has issued 3 green bonds over the past 4 years for a total of $2 billion. These bonds help support our progress towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 
DTE Gas announced CleanVision Natural Gas Balance, the nation's first program to include both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas for customers to reduce their carbon footprint. This program offers 4 levels of participation for customers ranging from $4 a month to offset 25% of an average home's gas use emissions to $16 a month to offset 100% of our carbon footprint. The carbon reduction goals are achieved with Michigan forest preservation and renewable natural gas. By helping to preserve Michigan's forest through this program, DTE customers not only support the removal of greenhouse gases but also preserve one of Michigan's greatest natural assets. Recently, DTE Gas executed a 7-year agreement to secure forestry carbon offsets to be used for this program. 
As for RNG, landfill emissions and wastewater treatment plant by-products are transformed to the fuel that heats homes and powers businesses and cars. We're excited to invite customers to be part of our ambitious vision to create a cleaner energy future. The program is off to a strong start with over 2,400 customers signed up to reduce their carbon footprint. 
Our Midstream company also announced its own 2050 net zero carbon emissions goal just earlier this year. Climate change is one of the defining public policy issues of our time, and I'm proud that this business is joining our electric and gas utilities in the effort to deliver cleaner energy. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. I will discuss DTE's solid start in 2021. 
Our first quarter financial results were strong, giving us even greater confidence in our 2021 financial plan, which could create investment opportunities later in the year. DTE earned $2.44 per share this quarter, up $0.78 from last year. And so with 1 quarter behind us, I am confident that DTE is well positioned to deliver on our financial plans this year and setting up well for success into 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we'll continue to target a 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate with 2020 original guidance as the base. We continue to focus on our balance sheet with strong cash flows and solid credit metrics. 
The spin-off of the Midstream business is on track for midyear execution. Our team is working diligently to make that happen, and I thank them for their efforts. As you know, the spin positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility with 90% of DTE's total operating earnings coming from our 2 regulated businesses. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent, well-financed gas midstream C-corp with accretive organic growth opportunities. Just as DTE is well positioned to deliver for investors, this new, independent Midstream company will also be positioned for success with a strong asset base and 2 of the most prolific dry gas basins in the country. 
The spin is progressing very well with the Form 10 filing and its standard review process with the SEC and an investor road show planned for the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to David Slater for updates on the Midstream business and the spin transaction progress."

Our Midstream business has had a solid first quarter, executing well across all platforms and assets. We are on track to achieve our financial targets in 2021, which include an EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million. DTM is also committed to a world-class ESG agenda. Earlier this year, we announced a net zero emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets, and we believe this will evolve to become a significant business opportunity over time for DTM. Additionally, DTM is establishing a Board of Directors committed to ensuring the company operates in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
As Jerry mentioned, we are on track for a midyear spin execution. Our Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade, and the solid, steady and strategic transformation has positioned this segment to become the industry leader it is today. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to further advance the company and create value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. The spin is on track for a midyear execution. We initiated the Form 10 process with the SEC back in February. Since then, we have been diligently working through the comment period, and this has been going smoothly as expected. In March, we held discussions with the rating agencies, which went very well. We will be receiving a credit rating at the time of our debt raise. The Form 10 will be public in the second quarter. We plan to hold an investor roadshow later in the second quarter as well. DTM's shares are expected to start trading on a when-issued basis 1 or 2 weeks before DTM shares begin regular-way trading on the New York Stock Exchange upon closing. 
Finally, the spin transaction will be executed midyear. As Jerry mentioned, successfully executing the spin has been made possible by the commitment and dedication of all of our employees. Thank you to our team for bringing their best energy to work each day and keeping everything on track. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."

Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS",727,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. 
Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the Appendix. 
I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $208 million for the quarter. This was $114 million higher than the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. DTE Electric also experienced nonqualified benefit plan losses in the first quarter of 2020. We have since taken measures to reduce market variability in these plans, so we'll no longer see this variability after the second quarter of 2020. If you remember, in the second quarter of 2020, the benefit plan losses reversed and were positive in that quarter. 
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $169 million, $48 million higher than first quarter last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. 
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $14 million higher than first quarter 2020 driven primarily by the LEAP pipeline going into service in the second half of 2020. 
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment. Operating earnings were $28 million. This was a $2 million decrease from first quarter last year due to steel-related earnings, offset by new RNG projects. 
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $14 million, which is consistent with first quarter earnings last year. This quarter, strong performance in the gas portfolio was offset by performance in the power portfolio, both -- which occurred during the period of extremely cold weather in Texas in the first quarter. Together, this positioned us slightly positive to our expectation for the quarter. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $21 million quarter-over-quarter primarily due to the timing of taxes and net change in interest. 
Overall, DTE earned $2.44 per share in the first quarter of 2021, which is $0.78 per share higher than 2020. I'd like to note that much of this favorability versus 2020 was anticipated in our plan. However, some of the favorability is due to DTE Electric, GSP and Energy Trading performing better than planned. This is positioning us well for 2021. We should have the opportunity to further invest in O&M initiatives that can improve reliability for our customers, which will also further strengthen our financial plans for 2022 and future years. 
Now moving on to Slide 10. I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open up for Q&A. 
In summary, we feel great about our first quarter results. We are on track to continue to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. The spin of our Midstream business is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and will establish DTM as an independent, gas-focused midstream company with accretive growth opportunities. We believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors in both companies. 
Our utilities continue to focus on necessary customer-focused infrastructure investments, specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. 
Our team deployed many innovative strategies to provide regulatory certainty during what continues to be a challenging time for many of our customers. This will enable DTE to maintain steady base rates through 2021. 
We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. DTE is targeting minimal equity issuances in 2021, and we continue to have minimal equity needs in our plan besides the convertible equity units in 2022. And we have maintained our solid dividend growth with a 7% dividend increase in 2021. 
In closing, as we approach the spin of our Midstream business, DTE is well positioned to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade. 
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

So maybe I'll just start by commenting on our own utility, where we've -- we're essentially offering a voluntary offset program that'll be driven both by forestry products and RNG, and we may be one of the first in the country to offer that type of package to our customers. And it's a very interesting offering where for $4 a month, you can offset about 25% of your carbon footprint as a gas customer. So it's a unique way of packaging carbon offsets through RNG as well as forestry products to deliver a lower-carbon footprint for our customers. 
I do see that expanding across the country, Michael. Right now, most of our efforts in RNG, at DTE Energy and our P&I business are focused on dairy gas going into the California markets, which gives us very nice returns both from our renewable fuel standard as well as the low-carbon fuel standard in California. We get, as I've mentioned in prior calls, returns where we see our simple cash payback happen in 3 to 4 years with pretty modest investments. Lots of projects in the pipeline as well going forward."

I think, as I mentioned, we've got 900 megawatts of voluntary renewables lined up, and we expect over the next 5 years to invest about $2 billion in regulated renewables inside our electric utility. 
As far as the nonutility business, our niche play has really become RNG, where we see that as a very lucrative -- a lucrative renewable resource. And we were first mover in that space and continue to originate really nice projects with unlevered IRRs after tax in the teens. And as I mentioned, simple cash paybacks of 3 to 4 years, and we see nothing but demand growth for that product.

As soon as we have supply available, it just flies off the shelf with our large industrials and commercial customers that have a very strong appetite for this. And even our residential customers. We're signing up thousands of customers every month, and we're sitting at about 30,000 customers right now on the residential level. So it seems to be a very appealing product.

Nothing very large yet. But I think as we evolve that platform, we've got a very significant opportunity with the fact that we were a first mover in building a 150-mile, 36-inch pipeline that takes volumes in the northern part of the Haynesville to markets in the Gulf Coast as well as the LNG export markets. 
So we are in discussions with various shippers to see if we can get a project off the ground there. So it's early, but I would say encouraging because, as you know, expanding new pipelines can be very economic and also accretive."

Dave Ruud will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. 
So let's start on Slide 1. As we have discussed before, our priorities at DTE are to support our employees, customers, and community, which then enables us to provide the strong, consistent growth investors have come to expect. Our focus this quarter was no different as we have delivered for all of our stakeholders. 
Our team at DTE has continued to perform at a very high level. We were recently recognized by Gallup as a great workplace. This is the ninth consecutive year we have received this award. We're off to an extremely safe start in 2021, coming off our safest year ever in 2020. 
As I have said, safety is our top priority at DTE, and getting people home safely to their families every day helps drive our success and employee engagement. We are building on our diversity, equity and inclusion focus with employees fully dedicated to helping the company on this journey. DTE is committed to accelerating our progression towards a workplace where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. We do understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included, safe and welcome. 
On the customer front, we continue to deliver safe and reliable energy. Just recently, DTE Electric received approval on its deferral request that delays next rate case filing until October 2021. This provides price stability for our customers, keeping base rates steady through 2021 and into 2022. As you'll recall, we previously received approval to delay a general rate until May. And this order extends the delay at least 5 additional months. This is another step towards stabilizing our customer affordability. 
Additionally, DTE is ranked as one of the top 10 utilities in the nation for energy efficiency and customer savings, and J.D. Power has ranked both our electric and gas utility at top quartile for residential customer satisfaction. These initiatives and recognitions show our continued commitment to service excellence. 
Supporting the communities where we live and serve remains critically important to us. DTE helped thousands of vulnerable customers lower their energy bills in 2020 while significantly reducing natural gas and electricity usage through energy efficiency initiatives. Our energy efficiency assistance program was recognized for keeping energy affordable for our most in-need customers. 
We recently contributed to Habitat for Humanity and supported their effort to weather-proof low-income homes. DTE also led a fundraising effort to help small business in Detroit go past the pandemic. We are also offering personal protective equipment, technical assistance and opening resources to assist small businesses across the city. With engaged employees, customers that are satisfied with our service and communities that are resilient, we deliver value for our investors. 
We delivered a strong first quarter with earnings of $2.44 per share and solid performances across all our business lines. We are on track to deliver 7% operating EPS growth from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. 
The Midstream spin is on track for midyear completion. The spin positions DTE Energy as a predominantly pure-play best-in-class utility. With significant capital investments of $19 billion over the next 5 years, 90% of that will go into our utilities. And we continue to target our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate with 2020 original guidance as the base for that growth. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent natural gas midstream company with assets in premium basins and accretive growth opportunities. 
On the next slide, I will discuss some of our major accomplishments from the first quarter. DTE has continued to focus on our environmental initiatives. DTE Electric has recently placed 3 wind parks in service. Isabella I and II, which are the largest wind parks in Michigan, have a total of 136 turbines with 383 megawatts of capacity. We also placed the Fairbanks Wind park in service with a capacity of 72 megawatts. DTE now has nearly 1,800 megawatts of capacity from renewable energy sources, enough to power 670,000 Michigan homes. This is a significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. 
The electric company recently filed a settlement agreement for voluntary renewables. The settlement includes 800 megawatts of renewable power additions, with 420 of that being slated for 2022 and the remaining 380 megawatts coming online in 2023 through 2025. These sources will support the voluntary renewable program, MIGreenPower, which continues to exceed our high expectations. We recently announced the commitment of a few new companies to the MIGreenPower program, including the state of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health. We have reached 900 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and approximately 30,000 residential customers. The program is the largest of its kind in the nation and helps advance our work towards a net zero carbon emissions goal. 
The electric company also received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission for Phase 2 of its Charging Forward initiative to strengthen electric vehicle infrastructure in the state of Michigan. This includes customer education and outreach, fleet advisory services and charging infrastructure components to further support electrification transition of fleet vehicles. 
At the end of March, the electric company completed its most recent offering of green bonds. The $1 billion bond offering will help fund the development and construction of solar wind farms, including transmission infrastructure to support renewable energy facilities. The funding will also strengthen energy efficiency programs to help Michigan residents and businesses save energy and reduce their bills. DTE Electric has issued 3 green bonds over the past 4 years for a total of $2 billion. These bonds help support our progress towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. 
DTE Gas announced CleanVision Natural Gas Balance, the nation's first program to include both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas for customers to reduce their carbon footprint. This program offers 4 levels of participation for customers ranging from $4 a month to offset 25% of an average home's gas use emissions to $16 a month to offset 100% of our carbon footprint. The carbon reduction goals are achieved with Michigan forest preservation and renewable natural gas. By helping to preserve Michigan's forest through this program, DTE customers not only support the removal of greenhouse gases but also preserve one of Michigan's greatest natural assets. Recently, DTE Gas executed a 7-year agreement to secure forestry carbon offsets to be used for this program. 
As for RNG, landfill emissions and wastewater treatment plant by-products are transformed to the fuel that heats homes and powers businesses and cars. We're excited to invite customers to be part of our ambitious vision to create a cleaner energy future. The program is off to a strong start with over 2,400 customers signed up to reduce their carbon footprint. 
Our Midstream company also announced its own 2050 net zero carbon emissions goal just earlier this year. Climate change is one of the defining public policy issues of our time, and I'm proud that this business is joining our electric and gas utilities in the effort to deliver cleaner energy. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. I will discuss DTE's solid start in 2021. 
Our first quarter financial results were strong, giving us even greater confidence in our 2021 financial plan, which could create investment opportunities later in the year. DTE earned $2.44 per share this quarter, up $0.78 from last year. And so with 1 quarter behind us, I am confident that DTE is well positioned to deliver on our financial plans this year and setting up well for success into 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we'll continue to target a 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate with 2020 original guidance as the base. We continue to focus on our balance sheet with strong cash flows and solid credit metrics. 
The spin-off of the Midstream business is on track for midyear execution. Our team is working diligently to make that happen, and I thank them for their efforts. As you know, the spin positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility with 90% of DTE's total operating earnings coming from our 2 regulated businesses. The spin also establishes DTM as an independent, well-financed gas midstream C-corp with accretive organic growth opportunities. Just as DTE is well positioned to deliver for investors, this new, independent Midstream company will also be positioned for success with a strong asset base and 2 of the most prolific dry gas basins in the country. 
The spin is progressing very well with the Form 10 filing and its standard review process with the SEC and an investor road show planned for the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn it over to David Slater for updates on the Midstream business and the spin transaction progress."

Our Midstream business has had a solid first quarter, executing well across all platforms and assets. We are on track to achieve our financial targets in 2021, which include an EBITDA range of $710 million to $750 million. DTM is also committed to a world-class ESG agenda. Earlier this year, we announced a net zero emissions target by 2050, making us one of the first companies in the midstream sector to announce such goal. We intend to use every tool available to reach our sustainability targets, and we believe this will evolve to become a significant business opportunity over time for DTM. Additionally, DTM is establishing a Board of Directors committed to ensuring the company operates in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
As Jerry mentioned, we are on track for a midyear spin execution. Our Midstream business has been transformed over the last decade, and the solid, steady and strategic transformation has positioned this segment to become the industry leader it is today. The creation of an independent Midstream C-corp will provide the opportunity to further advance the company and create value. 
Now let's turn to Slide 8. The spin is on track for a midyear execution. We initiated the Form 10 process with the SEC back in February. Since then, we have been diligently working through the comment period, and this has been going smoothly as expected. In March, we held discussions with the rating agencies, which went very well. We will be receiving a credit rating at the time of our debt raise. The Form 10 will be public in the second quarter. We plan to hold an investor roadshow later in the second quarter as well. DTM's shares are expected to start trading on a when-issued basis 1 or 2 weeks before DTM shares begin regular-way trading on the New York Stock Exchange upon closing. 
Finally, the spin transaction will be executed midyear. As Jerry mentioned, successfully executing the spin has been made possible by the commitment and dedication of all of our employees. Thank you to our team for bringing their best energy to work each day and keeping everything on track. 
Now I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud to discuss DTE's financial performance."
266598,711189511,2297736,"DTE Energy Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS",727,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 9 to review our first quarter financial results. 
Total operating earnings for the quarter were $473 million. This translates into $2.44 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the Appendix. 
I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $208 million for the quarter. This was $114 million higher than the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. DTE Electric also experienced nonqualified benefit plan losses in the first quarter of 2020. We have since taken measures to reduce market variability in these plans, so we'll no longer see this variability after the second quarter of 2020. If you remember, in the second quarter of 2020, the benefit plan losses reversed and were positive in that quarter. 
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $169 million, $48 million higher than first quarter last year. The earnings increase was driven primarily by new rate implementation and colder weather in 2021. 
Let's keep moving down the page to our Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $14 million higher than first quarter 2020 driven primarily by the LEAP pipeline going into service in the second half of 2020. 
On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial business segment. Operating earnings were $28 million. This was a $2 million decrease from first quarter last year due to steel-related earnings, offset by new RNG projects. 
On the next row, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $14 million, which is consistent with first quarter earnings last year. This quarter, strong performance in the gas portfolio was offset by performance in the power portfolio, both -- which occurred during the period of extremely cold weather in Texas in the first quarter. Together, this positioned us slightly positive to our expectation for the quarter. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $21 million quarter-over-quarter primarily due to the timing of taxes and net change in interest. 
Overall, DTE earned $2.44 per share in the first quarter of 2021, which is $0.78 per share higher than 2020. I'd like to note that much of this favorability versus 2020 was anticipated in our plan. However, some of the favorability is due to DTE Electric, GSP and Energy Trading performing better than planned. This is positioning us well for 2021. We should have the opportunity to further invest in O&M initiatives that can improve reliability for our customers, which will also further strengthen our financial plans for 2022 and future years. 
Now moving on to Slide 10. I'll wrap up the call, and then we can open up for Q&A. 
In summary, we feel great about our first quarter results. We are on track to continue to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate from our 2020 original guidance midpoint. The spin of our Midstream business is progressing as planned, and we are on track for completion midyear. This separation positions DTE as a predominantly pure-play utility and will establish DTM as an independent, gas-focused midstream company with accretive growth opportunities. We believe this transaction unlocks significant value for investors in both companies. 
Our utilities continue to focus on necessary customer-focused infrastructure investments, specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. 
Our team deployed many innovative strategies to provide regulatory certainty during what continues to be a challenging time for many of our customers. This will enable DTE to maintain steady base rates through 2021. 
We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. DTE is targeting minimal equity issuances in 2021, and we continue to have minimal equity needs in our plan besides the convertible equity units in 2022. And we have maintained our solid dividend growth with a 7% dividend increase in 2021. 
In closing, as we approach the spin of our Midstream business, DTE is well positioned to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade. 
With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open up the line for questions."

And it's a very interesting offering where for $4 a month, you can offset about 25% of your carbon footprint as a gas customer. So it's a unique way of packaging carbon offsets through RNG as well as forestry products to deliver a lower-carbon footprint for our customers. 
I do see that expanding across the country, Michael. Right now, most of our efforts in RNG, at DTE Energy and our P&I business are focused on dairy gas going into the California markets, which gives us very nice returns both from our renewable fuel standard as well as the low-carbon fuel standard in California. We get, as I've mentioned in prior calls, returns where we see our simple cash payback happen in 3 to 4 years with pretty modest investments. Lots of projects in the pipeline as well going forward."

This morning, I'll recap our performance for the second quarter then Dave will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. Let's start on Slide 4. We are making great progress this year at DTE for our team, our customers and our communities positioning us to deliver for our investors. This progress has produced a strong second quarter and positions us well for continued growth. Our distinctive team of 10,000-plus employees continues to be recognized for our engagement by Gallup with our ninth consecutive Great Workplace Award continue to build on this strength with our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion to create an even better workplace for all our employees where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. Our company celebrated [indiscernible] together last month with a series of virtual meetings, we pay tribute to this important day with global community partners. A number of employees offered reflections on what the day means to them personally. Overall, it was a great way to come together and honored a significant holiday. 
We understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included and welcome. We continue to focus on service excellence for our customers and delivering clean, safe and reliable energy as we continue our clean energy transformation. DTE Electric received approval from the MPSC to further expand the voluntary renewable program by GreenPower, while also making it even more affordable, including increased access for low-income customers. Additionally, we partnered with Ford Motor Company to install new rooftop solar and battery storage technology at the Ford Research and Engineering Center. The array includes an integrated battery storage system and will be used to power newly installed electric vehicle chargers. 
This can generate over 1,100 megawatt hours of clean energy. We also continue to support the communities where we live and serve.  We  were also recognized by Points of Light for the fourth consecutive year as one of the Civic 50 0. This award highlights DTE as one of the top 50 community-minded companies nationwide and corporate citizenship. We also launched a Tree Trim Academy to create 200 high-paying jobs in Detroit. DTE has a need for Tree Trimmers, and the community has a need for good high-quality jobs. It will also help us continue to improve electric liability as trees account for over 70% of our customer outages. 
On the investor front, we completed the spin of the midstream business. Now DTE Midstream is a stand-alone company and DTE Energy is a predominantly pure-play utility with 90% of operating earnings coming from our utilities. The transaction went very smoothly and was well received by all stakeholders. We didn't miss a beat on a very strategic transaction and many said we made it look easy. Many thanks to the DTE team and our advisers that made this effort a great success for our employees and our investors. We delivered a strong second quarter with earnings of $1.70 per share, and we are raising our 2021 operating earnings guidance and continue to pay a strong dividend. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. DTE is continuing to deliver successful operating results. At DTE Electric, we made another significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions as we retired River Rouge Power Plant in the second quarter. For over 60 years, the River Rouge Power Plant delivered safe, reliable and affordable energy for community [indiscernible] Michigan. River Rouge is 1 of the 3 coal-fired power plants, DTE is retiring by the end of 2022, which is an integral part of our company's clean energy transformation. 
We continue to look at ways to accelerate our coal fleet retirements and potentially file our updated IRP before September of 2023. We continue to expand on our voluntary renewable program, which is exceeding our high expectations. In the first quarter, we announced the commitment of new customers to MIGreenPower, including the State of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health. 
During the second quarter, we signed up a number of new large customers, including Detroit Diesel, which is now one of our largest voluntary renewable customers. The program continues to grow at an impressive rate. So far, we've reached 950 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and approximately 35,000 residential customers. We have an additional 400 megawatts in the very advanced stages of discussion for future customers. MIGreenPower is 1 of the largest voluntary renewable programs in the nation and helps advance our work towards our net 0 carbon emission goal while helping our customers meet their decarbonization goals. We have made progress with our expedited tree trimming program, which is greatly improving reliability for our customers and have received Michigan Public Service Commission approval to securitize the tree trimming costs along with costs associated with the River Rouge Power Plant retirement. 
At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We began the second phase of construction on our major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan in June. The project includes the installation of a new pipeline as well as facility modification work which will reduce the risk of significant customer outages. Project is on track to be in service by the first quarter of next year. Last quarter, we announced our New CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program. This program provides the opportunity for customers to purchase both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. 
We enable them to reduce their carbon footprint. We are proud of how fast the program is growing. [indiscernible] we have over 3,000 customers subscribed, and we are looking forward to seeing it become as successful as our voluntary renewable program at DTE Electric. 
On our Power and Industrial business, we continue to add new projects as we began construction on a new RNG facility on a large dairy farm in South Dakota. This will be P&I's largest dairy R&D project to date. Project will directly inject RNG into the Northern Natural Gas system for sale into the California transportation fuels market. Facility is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2022. We are also in advanced discussions on several new industrial energy and R&D projects. and we'll provide updates on these as they progress. 
P&I was also recognized by the Association of Union Contractors with the 2020 Project of the Year Award for the Ford Dearborn cogeneration project. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's accomplishments year-to-date, and I'm looking forward to more successes in 2021 and beyond. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. As I said, we've had a very strong start to 2021. We are raising our operating earnings guidance midpoint from $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share, moving our year-over-year growth and operating EPS guidance from 7.4% to a robust 12.5%. We are able to use some of this favorability to position the company to continue to deliver in future years. We mentioned in Q1, we were deep into planning for 2022 in a great level of detail. With all of this work, we feel great about achieving a smooth 5% to 7% growth trajectory into 2022 and through the 5-year plan. We are not going to see any surprises from us in our growth rate in 2022 in spite of the [indiscernible] and the converts coming due.  90% of our future operating earnings will be from our 2 regulated utilities, where we have a large investment agenda with $17 billion of capital investment in our 5-year plan, focused on clean energy and customer reliability. Overall, we feel very confident with our performance in 2021 and our future operational and financial performance. Now I'll turn it over to Dave to discuss DTE's financial performance. Dave, over to you."
266598,1673777434,2351538,"DTE Energy Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $329 million. This translates into $1.70 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS b",829,"Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $329 million. This translates into $1.70 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. The second quarter was a really warm quarter for us here in Michigan. In fact, it was the seventh warmest on record. 
DTE Electric earnings were $238 million for the quarter, which was $19 million higher than the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher commercial sales, rate implementation and warmer weather offset by nonqualified benefit plan gains that we had in 2020. As we mentioned in the first quarter call, we've taken steps to reduce the variability of these investments going forward. Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $7 million, $4 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The earnings decrease was driven primarily by the warmer weather in 2021, offset by new rates. Let's keep moving to the Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. 
Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2020, driven primarily by the LEAP pipeline going into service and strong earnings across the pipeline segment. On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial segment operating earnings were $34 million. This is a $9 million increase from second quarter last year due to new RNG projects beginning operation. 
On the next one, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $21 million, which is $16 million higher than second quarter earnings last year due primarily to strong performance in the gas portfolio. Year-to-date through the second quarter, this positions us positive to our expectation and our original guidance for the year. Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $22 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the timing of taxes and higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $1.70 per share in the second quarter of 2021, which is $0.17 per share higher than 2020. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Given the strong start to the year, we were able to use this favorability to position ourselves to continue to deliver for our customers and investors in future years. And we are also increasing our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint [ from ] $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share. The increase in guidance is due primarily to warmer-than-normal weather, sustained continuous improvement and uncollectible expense variability at DTE Electric, higher REF volumes at P&I and stronger performance of energy trading due to the realization of gains from a small, long physical storage position during the extreme cold weather event in Texas in the first quarter. 
In the third quarter, we are seeing additional sales upside for Electric compared to our plan and higher-than-planned REF volumes at P&I. We are continuing to explore opportunities to support future years through our invest strategy and to support future customer affordability. As you can see on the slide, there is no Gas Storage and Pipeline segment in our operating guidance for this year. The GSP segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the third quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. Due to our continued strong cash flows, DTE is targeting no equity issuances in 2021 and has minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We have a strong investment-grade rating and targeted an FFO-to-debt ratio of 16%. With the proceeds from the spin-off of DTM, we are retiring long-term parent debt of approximately $2.6 billion after debt breakage costs. These were NPV-positive transaction and immediately EPS accretive as we were able to retire a higher interest rate debt to support our current plan and to deliver our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. 
Now I'll wrap up on Slide 10, and we open the line for questions. We feel great about our second quarter accomplishments, and we are confident in achieving our increased 2021 guidance and continuing to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. Our utilities continue to focus on our infrastructure investment agenda specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. 
We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics and are targeting no equity issuances in 2021. In closing, after executing a successful spin of our midstream business, DTE continues to be well positioned to deliver the premium, total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade with strong utility growth and a growing dividend. With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open the line for questions."

We've started with a larger position in our coal fleet and our self-generation fleet. So we are looking very closely at how we can accelerate all of these retirements prior to 2040. So you'll recall that in our prior IRP, we were retiring all of our coal by 2040. So we're looking at acceleration scenarios to pull that forward. And as I've mentioned in past discussions, we will update you likely at the end of the year or early next year as what those plans may look like. And we're spending a lot of time with various stakeholders through the summer, including our Board, having those conversations, trying to balance the interest of acceleration and of course, affordability and reliability."

First, if you look at quarter-over-quarter that we have in there, you could see that was way up. And that was especially commercial and industrial, that was really because we were comparing back to the worst period of the pandemic. So quarter-over-quarter, we saw commercial and industrial way up. Interestingly, we saw residential stay pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. And that's interesting because last year, with people working from home, we saw our residential load running at an average of about 8% higher than we would have expected pre pandemic. And this year, so far, we're seeing that continue, even though there has been some return to work, but we still see that we're seeing this favorability at residential, and that's what's driving some of the favorability. So we've expected it to reduce more, but at this point, it's pretty sticky. So we're going to be watching this closely to see how it plays out and how it can impact really customer affordability going forward if it's remained sticky.
Yes, I would say on commercial load, I mean, that's come pretty much all the way back from as to what we would have expected. We at the kind of the height of the pandemic, we thought we'd see some more bankruptcies and closures in commercial, and we really haven't seen that. So we've seen our commercial load really come back to as expected.  Industrial load was coming back and pretty much came back, but that has some variability in it due to some of the instability really or the challenges at the auto plants right now with the chip shortages, they're running a little more sporadically. But really, it's been a great return to load and then the residential remains really sticky for us."

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. This morning, I'll recap our performance for the second quarter then Dave will provide a financial review of the quarter and wrap things up before we take your questions. Let's start on Slide 4. We are making great progress this year at DTE for our team, our customers and our communities positioning us to deliver for our investors. This progress has produced a strong second quarter and positions us well for continued growth. Our distinctive team of 10,000-plus employees continues to be recognized for our engagement by Gallup with our ninth consecutive Great Workplace Award, continuing to build on this strength with our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion to create an even better workplace for all our employees where everyone feels valued, welcome and able to contribute their best energy. Our company celebrated Juneteenth together last month with a series of virtual meetings, we pay tribute to this important day with global community partners. A number of employees offered reflections on what the day means to them personally. Overall, it was a great way to come together and honored a significant holiday. 
We understand that all people thrive and succeed when they feel included and welcome. We continue to focus on service excellence for our customers and delivering clean, safe and reliable energy as we continue our clean energy transformation. DTE Electric received approval from the MPSC to further expand the voluntary renewable program by MIGreenPower, while also making it even more affordable, including increased access for low-income customers. Additionally, we partnered with Ford Motor Company to install new rooftop solar and battery storage technology at the Ford Research and Engineering Center. The array includes an integrated battery storage system and will be used to power newly installed electric vehicle chargers. 
This can generate over 1,100 megawatt-hours of clean energy. We also continue to support the communities where we live and serve. We were also recognized by Points of Light for the fourth consecutive year as one of the Civic 50. This award highlights DTE as one of the top 50 community-minded companies nationwide in corporate citizenship. We also launched a Tree Trim Academy to create 200 high-paying jobs in Detroit. DTE has a need for Tree Trimmers, and the community has a need for good high-quality jobs. It will also help us continue to improve electric liability as trees account for over 70% of our customer outages. 
On the investor front, we completed the spin of the midstream business. Now DTE Midstream is a stand-alone company and DTE Energy is a predominantly pure-play utility with 90% of operating earnings coming from our utilities. The transaction went very smoothly and was well received by all stakeholders. We didn't miss a beat on a very strategic transaction and many said we made it look easy. Many thanks to the DTE team and our advisers that made this effort a great success for our employees and our investors. We delivered a strong second quarter with earnings of $1.70 per share, and we are raising our 2021 operating earnings guidance and continue to pay a strong dividend. 
Let's turn to Slide 5. DTE is continuing to deliver successful operating results. At DTE Electric, we made another significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions as we retired River Rouge Power Plant in the second quarter. For over 60 years, the River Rouge Power Plant delivered safe, reliable and affordable energy for communities throughout Southeast Michigan. River Rouge is one of the 3 coal-fired power plants DTE is retiring by the end of 2022, which is an integral part of our company's clean energy transformation. 
We continue to look at ways to accelerate our coal fleet retirements and potentially file our updated IRP before September of 2023. We continue to expand on our voluntary renewable program, which is exceeding our high expectations. In the first quarter, we announced the commitment of new customers to MIGreenPower, including the State of Michigan, Bedrock and Trinity Health. 
During the second quarter, we signed up a number of new large customers, including Detroit Diesel, which is now one of our largest voluntary renewable customers. The program continues to grow at an impressive rate. So far, we've reached 950 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and approximately 35,000 residential customers. We have an additional 400 megawatts in the very advanced stages of discussion for future customers. MIGreenPower is one of the largest voluntary renewable programs in the nation and helps advance our work towards our net zero carbon emission goal while helping our customers meet their decarbonization goals. We have made progress with our expedited Tree Trimming program, which is greatly improving reliability for our customers and have received Michigan Public Service Commission approval to securitize the Tree Trimming costs along with costs associated with the River Rouge Power Plant retirement. 
At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We began the second phase of construction on our major transmission renewal project in Northern Michigan in June. The project includes the installation of a new pipeline as well as facility modification work which will reduce the risk of significant customer outages. Project is on track to be in service by the first quarter of next year. Last quarter, we announced our new CleanVision Natural Gas Balance program. This program provides the opportunity for customers to purchase both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas. 
We enable them to reduce their carbon footprint. We are proud of how fast the program is growing. Currently we have over 3,000 customers subscribed, and we are looking forward to seeing it become as successful as our voluntary renewable program at DTE Electric. 
On our Power and Industrial business, we continue to add new projects as we began construction on a new RNG facility on a large dairy farm in South Dakota. This will be P&I's largest dairy R&D project to date. Project will directly inject RNG into the Northern Natural Gas system for sale into the California transportation fuels market. Facility is expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2022. We are also in advanced discussions on several new industrial energy and RNG projects. and we'll provide updates on these as they progress. 
P&I was also recognized by The Association of Union Contractors with the 2020 Project of the Year Award for the Ford Dearborn cogeneration project. Overall, I am extremely proud of the team's accomplishments year-to-date, and I'm looking forward to more successes in 2021 and beyond. 
Now moving on to Slide 6. As I said, we've had a very strong start to 2021. We are raising our operating earnings guidance midpoint from $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share, moving our year-over-year growth and operating EPS guidance from 7.4% to a robust 12.5%. We are able to use some of this favorability to position the company to continue to deliver in future years. We mentioned in Q1, we were deep into planning for 2022 in a great level of detail. With all of this work, we feel great about achieving a smooth 5% to 7% growth trajectory into 2022 and through the 5-year plan. You are not going to see any surprises from us in our growth rate in 2022 in spite of the [ area rollouts ] and the converts coming due. 90% of our future operating earnings will be from our 2 regulated utilities, where we have a large investment agenda with $17 billion of capital investment in our 5-year plan, focused on clean energy and customer reliability. Overall, we feel very confident with our performance in 2021 and our future operational and financial performance. Now I'll turn it over to Dave to discuss DTE's financial performance. Dave, over to you."
266598,1673777434,2352000,"DTE Energy Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $329 million. This translates into $1.70 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS b",826,"Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 7 to review our second quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $329 million. This translates into $1.70 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. The second quarter was a really warm quarter for us here in Michigan. In fact, it was the seventh warmest on record. 
DTE Electric earnings were $238 million for the quarter, which was $19 million higher than the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher commercial sales, rate implementation and warmer weather offset by nonqualified benefit plan gains that we had in 2020. As we mentioned in the first quarter call, we've taken steps to reduce the variability of these investments going forward. Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $7 million, $4 million lower than the second quarter of last year. The earnings decrease was driven primarily by the warmer weather in 2021, offset by new rates. Let's keep moving to the Gas Storage and Pipelines business on the third row. 
Operating earnings for GSP were $86 million. This was $16 million higher than the second quarter of 2020, driven primarily by the LEAP pipeline going into service and strong earnings across the Pipeline segment. On the next row, you can see our Power and Industrial segment operating earnings were $34 million. This is a $9 million increase from second quarter last year due to new RNG projects beginning operation. 
On the next one, you can see our operating earnings at our Energy Trading business were $21 million, which is $16 million higher than second quarter earnings last year due primarily to strong performance in the Gas portfolio. Year-to-date through the second quarter, this positions us positive to our expectation and our original guidance for the year. Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $22 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to the timing of taxes and higher interest expense. Overall, DTE earned $1.70 per share in the second quarter of 2021, which is $0.17 per share higher than 2020. 
Moving on to Slide 8. Given the strong start to the year, we were able to use this favorability to position ourselves to continue to deliver for our customers and investors in future years. And we are also increasing our 2021 operating EPS guidance midpoint, $5.51 per share to $5.77 per share. The increase in guidance is due primarily to warmer-than-normal weather, sustained continuous improvement and uncollectible expense variability at DTE Electric, higher REF volumes at P&I and stronger performance of energy trading due to the realization of gains from a small, long physical storage position during the extreme cold weather event in Texas in the first quarter. 
In the third quarter, we are seeing additional sales upside for Electric compared to our plan and higher-than-planned REF volumes at P&I. We are continuing to explore opportunities to support future years through our invest strategy and to support future customer affordability. As you can see on the slide, there is no Gas Storage and Pipeline segment in our operating guidance for this year. The GSP segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the third quarter. 
Let's turn to Slide 9 to briefly discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan. We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. Due to our continued strong cash flows, DTE is targeting no equity issuances in 2021 and has minimal equity needs in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022. We have a strong investment-grade rating and targeted an FFO-to-debt ratio of 16%. With the proceeds from the spin-off of DTM, we are retiring long-term parent debt of approximately $2.6 billion after debt breakage costs. These were NPV-positive transaction and immediately EPS accretive as we were able to retire a higher interest rate debt to support our current plan and to deliver our 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. 
Now I'll wrap up on Slide 10, and we open the line for questions. We feel great about our second quarter accomplishments, and we are confident in achieving our increased 2021 guidance and continuing to deliver on our long-term 5% to 7% operating EPS growth rate. Our utilities continue to focus on our infrastructure investment agenda specifically investments in clean generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. 
We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics and are targeting no equity issuances in 2021. In closing, after executing a successful spin of our midstream business, DTE continues to be well positioned to deliver the premium, total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade with strong utility growth and a growing dividend. With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open the line for questions."

So quarter-over-quarter, we saw commercial and industrial way up. Interestingly, we saw residential stay pretty flat quarter-over-quarter. And that's interesting because last year, with people working from home, we saw our residential load running at an average of about 8% higher than we would have expected pre pandemic. And this year, so far, we're seeing that continue, even though there has been some return to work, but we still see that we're seeing this favorability at residential, and that's what's driving some of the favorability. So we've expected it to reduce more, but at this point, it's pretty sticky.

I'll be giving you an update on our 2021 performance and an overview of our long-term plan. Dave will then provide details on our financials. Then we'll take your questions. 
So let's start on Slide 4. On the second quarter call, I said that we were having a strong start to the year. And with 3 quarters of 2021 behind us, that description is still on the market as we continue to deliver for our team, customers, communities and investors. This progress in 2021 positions us well for our future growth. DTE continues to be recognized for our engagement by Gallup with our ninth consecutive Great Workplace Award. In addition, we remain committed to our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. Switching over to our customers. As you know, our service territory experienced some major storms. This summer, we had 12 storms with 5 having over 100,000 outages. 
It is something we have never seen in DTE's history. I would like to thank our entire team for really responding in incredible ways for these historic events. Our crews work countless hours to restore power to our customers. And for that, I am very grateful. We understand how important it is provide reliable power and are committed to making continuous improvements as part of our service excellence efforts for our customers now and into the future. We have accelerated our efforts in the most impacted communities, including Wayne, Oakland and Washington counties. In an effort to accelerate our preventive maintenance, we are increasing our treating workforce from 10 to almost 1,500 people, and our overhead line workforce from 850 to over 1,000. 
We made the decision to invest an additional $70 million in our 2 trimming program from 2021 to 2023, as over 2/3 of our outages are tree related. Additionally, we have been making significant investments and increasing our focus on grid reliability. We are advancing our efforts to get trees off the wires and deliver clean, safe and reliable energy, all while focusing on service excellence for our customers. We filed a distribution grid plan with the Michigan Public Service Commission in September. 
The plan addresses the long-term investment strategy that prepares our grid for the eventual electrification of transportation and addresses the increasingly severe weather patterns that we have seen in our service territory. Moving on to our communities. We are continuing our commitment to provide cleaner, more reliable energy. We have partnered with Wash now County to build our first migraine power community solar project. The 20-megawatt facility will be the largest of its kind in the area. On the investor front, we continue to have a strong financial year and are well positioned to deliver growth. 
As you will see in our 2022 outlook and our 5-year plan, we are on track to deliver 5% to 7% EPS growth through 2026 and dividend growth in line with our EPS growth. Now let's turn to Slide 5. 2021 is shaping up to be a very successful year. We are raising the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance from $5.77 to $5.84 per share. This is 14% growth in EPS from our original 2020 guidance. And I feel very confident that you'll see a final 2021 number but is at the higher end of our new operating EPS guidance range. I am proud that we're able to deliver these results while we continue to keep our electric base rates flat throughout most of 2022. 
We have not increased our electric base rates since May of 2020, and we don't plan to file our next electric rate case until early next year. For 2022, we are providing an operating EPS early outlook range of $5.70 to $5.97 per share. Even with the REF earnings rolling off at the end of this year, we continue to deliver 6% growth from the 2021 original guidance midpoint. We will work towards hitting the higher end of that range as we have done in the past. Today, we are also announcing a 7% increase to our 2022 annualized dividend in line with the top end of our operating EPS growth target. 
As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we retired the River Rouge power plant this year, and plan to retire Trenton Channel and St. Clair power plants in 2022. This is nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal retirements or 30% of our coal generation fleet. In this quarter, we made another significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions. We announced that we'll be ceasing coal use of Bell River by 2028, 2 years earlier than originally planned, and preparing also to file an updated integrated resource plan in the fall of 2022, almost 1 year earlier than planned. 
We look forward to working with all stakeholders to address ways to further accelerate decarbonization, while always maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. In order to ensure we continue to have clean, reliable and affordable power for our customers. We have built or contracted for 2,500 megawatts of wind and solar energy, purchased 1,200 megawatts of natural gas peaker plants and expect our new state-of-the-art 1,100-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be up and running in 2022 to coincide with our coal retirements. 
Now moving over to the nonutility side, we are renaming our Power and Industrial segment to DTE Vantage. Through our unique vantage point, we are helping customers transform the way their energy is produced and managed to be substantially cleaner and more efficient. The named DTE Vantage better reflects our position in bringing an innovative, cleaner energy solutions to our customers. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our 5-year capital plan. 
Over the 5-year plan, our utilities continue to focus on our infrastructure investment agenda, especially investments in cleaner generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our updated 5-year utility plan is $18 billion, which is $1 billion higher than the prior plan. 
Over 90% of our 5-year investment plan will be at our 2 utilities. Investments in our nonutility business are strategically focused on our customers' needs and aligns with our aggressive ESG initiatives. Overall, we have a robust total investment agenda of [ $19.5 billion ] over the next 5 years. And as always, we continue to look for ways to bring more capital into the plan to advance our clean vision plan and further improve reliability for our customers while maintaining affordability. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. At DTE Electric, we announced our plan to accelerate decarbonization by ceasing coal use at the Bell River power plant by 2028, reducing carbon emissions by 50%, 2 years earlier than originally planned. This is another step toward our goal of net 0 carbon emissions. Additionally, we expect to file our integrated resource plan in the fall of 2022, 1 year earlier than planned. By making this important generation decision now, ETE continues to accelerate our journey toward cleaner energy generation that is affordable and reliable for the customers and communities we serve. 
The $1 billion increase in our DTE Electric 5-year plan is driven by distribution infrastructure investments, preparing our grid for electrification and hardening initiatives and increased cleaner energy investment due to our voluntary renewable program, which is still exceeding our high expectations. This quarter, we have partnered with Washington County, to build our first Migraine Power solar project. 
Overall, the Migraine Power program, which is one of the largest in the nation, continues to grow at an impressive rate. So far, we have reached over 950 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and over 40,000 residential customers. We have an additional 400 megawatts in advanced stages of discussion with future customers. For our distribution infrastructure renewal, we are supporting electrification and load growth with infrastructure redesign, improving circuit reliability and reducing restoration times with system hardening and enabling a smarter grid with advanced technology and automation. This $15 billion investment over the next 5 years supports our long-term operating earnings growth of 7% to 8% of the electric company. 
And now let's discuss the opportunities at our gas utility on Slide 8. At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Earlier this year, we announced our new natural gas balance program. This program provides the opportunity for customers to purchase both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas to enable them offset up to 100% of the carbon from their natural gas usage. We are proud of how fast this program is growing. Earlier, we have over 4,000 customers subscribed, and we look forward to seeing it become as successful as our voluntary renewable program at DTE Electric. 
Overall, at DTE Gas, we are planning on investing $3 billion over the next 5 years to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure with potential upside to the plan of $500 million. Along with our pipeline integrity and main replacement investments, we are investing in innovative technology and products that will reduce methane emissions and the carbon footprint for our company. Overall, we expect our long-term operating growth to be 9% at DTE Gas. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, we renamed our P&I business to DTE Vantage. We are planning on investing between $1 billion to $1.5 billion at this segment over the next 5 years. We are targeting operating earnings of $85 million to $95 million in 2022, growing to $160 million to $170 million in 2026, with approximately 80% of  the operating earnings in this business coming from decarbonization-related projects. As the REF business sunsets at the end of this year, we continue to see additional opportunities in renewable natural gas and industrial energy services. Earlier this year, we told you about a new RNG project in South Dakota, which is now under construction, and slated to start up in the second quarter of next year. 
We commenced construction on another Wisconsin RNG project in the third quarter and entered into an agreement for an additional RNG project, which will be our first project in New York. In aggregate, these 3 projects will serve the vehicle fuel market producing over 500,000 million BTUs of RNG per year, with 100% of the production offtake contracted long term. There has been strong RNG market growth, supported by the federal renewable fuel standard in California's low carbon fuel standard. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our growing preference for efficient energy with the opportunity to implement cogeneration systems, especially as manufacturing plants, continue to open up nationwide. 
This also puts us in a very good position to explore additional decarbonization opportunities, including carbon capture and storage. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to give you a financial update. Dave, over to you."

Let me start on Slide 10 to review our third quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $334 million. This translates into $1.72 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS b",978,"Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 10 to review our third quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $334 million. This translates into $1.72 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $342 million for the quarter. This was lower than the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to cooler weather in 2021 and higher storm costs, partially offset by higher commercial sales. .
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $10 million lower than the third quarter last year. The earnings decrease was driven primarily by higher O&M expenses and rate base growth cost partially offset by the rate implementation. Let's keep moving down the page to DTE Vantage on the third row. Operating earnings were $73 million. This was $26 million higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven primarily by REF earnings and new RNG projects. On the next row, you can see Energy Trading had another solid quarter, with operating earnings relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. 
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $3 million quarter-over-quarter. There are a couple of main drivers for this variance. The largest driver is the timing of taxes, which will reverse in the fourth quarter. We also had a onetime tax item true-up subsequent to the spin of DTE Midstream. As we look forward to the balance of the year, the tax timing adjustments for the first 3 quarters will result approximately a $50 million favorable reversal in the fourth quarter. So our full year 2021 results at Corporate and Other is expected to fall within our guidance for that segment. Overall, DTE has earned $1.72 per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2021. This represents a very strong third quarter and our year-to-date results put us in a great position for the year. 
Let's turn to slide 11. 
[Audio Gap] 
is in the midpoint of our 2021 operating EPS guidance from $5.77 to $5.84 per share. Our revised operating EPS guidance range for 2021 is $5.70 to $5.98 per share. And with strong year-to-date performance, we expect our full year operating EPS to be biased towards the higher end of this range. This bias to the higher end also reflects the additional investment in reliability as we are investing $70 million to combat extreme weather-related power outages with no impact to our customer bills. Additionally, we've contemplated some further invest opportunities in our businesses during 2021, which positions DTE well for success in future years. 
Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss our 2022 outlook. We are continuing strong 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth through some significant milestones. We are converting $1.3 billion of mandatory equity in '22, and the REF business will sunset at the end of 2021. Through this, we will achieve 6% growth from 2021 original guidance. Our 2022 operating EPS early outlook midpoint is $5.84 per share, and we will work toward hitting the higher end of our range of $5.70 to $5.97 per share. 
In 2022, at DTE Electric growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. DTE Gas will see continued customer-focused investments in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements to support our capital plan. As we discussed, 2021 is the final year of earnings for our reduced emission fuels business at DTE Vantage, approximately $90 million of REF earnings net of associated costs rolls off at the end of the year. This is offset by new project earnings in 2022. 2022 earnings at this segment are largely driven by continued RNG and industrial energy services projects that will serve as a base for growth going forward. At Corporate and Other, the biggest driver in our year-over-year improvement is lower interest expense. This is the result of leveraging earnings and cash strength in 2021 to opportunistically remarket some higher-priced debt. This will provide interest savings in 2022 and future years. 
Let's turn to Slide 13 to discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan and wrap up before taking your questions. We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. Due to our strong cash flows, DTE has minimal equity issuances in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022, while also increasing our 5-year capital investment plan by $1 billion. 
We have a strong investment-grade credit rating and target an FFO to debt of 16%. Additionally, we are increasing our 2022 dividend by 7% to $3.54 per share. In the third quarter, we completed our liability management plan following the spin of our midstream business. Using the funds raised from DTMs debt issuance, we repurchased a little over $2.6 billion of corporate debt and incurred approximately $400 million of debt breakage fees associated with the early retirement of the debt. Since this debt was allocated to the midstream business in our previous financial statements, you won't see a large decrease in the debt level at corporate and other. This liability management plan is NPV positive, EPS accretive, and further supports our long-term growth. 
So in summary, we feel great about our success so far this year and are confident in achieving our increased 2021 guidance. 2022 is looking good with 6% EPS growth from 2021 original guidance and our increased 5-year capital plan supports our 5% to 7% long-term growth while delivering cleaner generation and increased reliability for our customers. DTE continues to be well positioned to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade with strong utility growth and a dividend growing in line with EPS. With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open the line for questions."

So Shar, as you've seen, we've accelerated the River power plant conversion from coal to other fuel sources like natural gas or RNG and potentially hydrogen. So that's certainly that works by 2028. As you mentioned, we're going to file an IRP in the fall of next year, and we're going to really use the next year to get a lot of feedback from interested stakeholders like the commission and other parties that will have an interest in our acceleration of coal retirements. As you know, the Monroe coal plant is slated to retire in 2040, but we are looking at many scenarios to pull that forward, share. 
So that will be -- become much more transparent when we file the IRP, the details of exactly how we're going to do that and also replace that baseload generation. It's over 3,000 megawatts of baseload generation. So we're going to have to think through very carefully, how do we maintain reliability and affordability and get good feedback from our stakeholders. 
So what you see in the current 5-year outlook is an increase of about $1 billion in cleaner generation that's really driven primarily by our investments in voluntary renewables as well as some investments that we have on our Omtydro facility and a small hydrogen pilot perhaps at our Blue Water Energy Center."

Then on the the tax timing, the effective tax rate, that's an adjustment that we do for GAAP.

But it is very expensive. So you have to be very strategic about how you do it. So just to give you an idea about 7 or 8 years ago, I was asked by a mayor of one of the communities that we serve, whether we could underground the whole system. 
And it was a community of 14,000 residents and the cost underground was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost to trim those circuits was $200,000 or $300,000 and which would give us about 95% of the same reliability impact. So it's, again, undergrounding is great.

Great. I think we have to approach it in a strategic manner.

We've seen some significant reliability impacts by retiring baseload generation and replacing it with intermittent resources. 
Now we love renewables. We obviously are a big investor, the largest investor in renewables in our state, but we also feel that reliability is paramount. So when we think about our coal plants and the conversion of those or retirement of those, we really need to think carefully how and when we do it because the first thing our customers want is reliable power and affordable power and cleaner power. So all of those have to be balanced. So I would say keeping our options open to ensure that we have reliable power as we make this transition is going to be extremely important. And you'll see that in our IRP. We will accelerate our coal retirements in our IRP that you'll see next fall. 
But you'll also see careful consideration on how that's done to ensure reliable power and afforded by power and Clean Power to go with it."

I'll be giving you an update on our 2021 performance and an overview of our long-term plan. Dave will then provide details on our financials. Then we'll take your questions.  
So let's start on Slide 4. On the second quarter call, I said that we were having a strong start to the year. And with 3 quarters of 2021 behind us, that description is still on the mark, as we continue to deliver for our team, customers, communities and investors. This progress in 2021 positions us well for our future growth. DTE continues to be recognized for our engagement by Gallup with our ninth consecutive Great Workplace Award. In addition, we remain committed to our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Switching over to our customers. As you know, our service territory experienced some major storms. This summer, we had 12 storms with 5 having over 100,000 outages. It is something we have never seen in DTE's history. I would like to thank our entire team for really responding in incredible ways for these historic events. Our crews work countless hours to restore power to our customers. And for that, I am very grateful. We understand how important it is to provide reliable power and are committed to making continuous improvements as part of our service excellence efforts for our customers now and into the future. We have accelerated our efforts in the most impacted communities, including Wayne, Oakland and Washtenaw counties. In an effort to accelerate our preventive maintenance, we are increasing our tree trim workforce from 1,200 to almost 1,500 people, and our overhead line workforce from 850 to over 1,000.  
We made the decision to invest an additional $70 million in our tree trimming programs from 2021 to 2023, as over 2/3 of our outages are tree related. Additionally, we have been making significant investments and increasing our focus on grid reliability. We are advancing our efforts to get trees off the wires and deliver clean, safe and reliable energy, all while focusing on service excellence for our customers. 
We filed a distribution grid plan with the Michigan Public Service Commission in September. The plan addresses the long-term investment strategy that prepares our grid for the eventual electrification of transportation and addresses the increasingly severe weather patterns that we have seen in our service territory. Moving on to our communities. We are continuing our commitment to provide cleaner, more reliable energy. We have partnered with Washtenaw County to build our first MIGreenPower community solar project. The 20-megawatt facility will be the largest of its kind in the area. 
On the investor front, -- we continue to have a strong financial year and are well-positioned to deliver growth. As you will see in our 2022 outlook and our 5-year plan, we are on track to deliver 5% to 7% EPS growth through 2026 and dividend growth in line with our EPS growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 5. 2021 is shaping up to be a very successful year. We are raising the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance from $5.77 to $5.84 per share. This is 14% growth in EPS from our original 2020 guidance. And I feel very confident that you'll see a final 2021 number that is at the higher end of our new operating EPS guidance range. I am proud that we're able to deliver these results while we continue to keep our electric base rates flat throughout most of 2022. We have not increased our electric base rates since May of 2020, and we don't plan to file our next electric rate case until early next year. 
For 2022, we are providing an operating EPS early outlook range of $5.70 to $5.97 per share. Even with the REF earnings rolling off at the end of this year, we continue to deliver 6% growth from the 2021 original guidance midpoint. We will work towards hitting the higher end of that range as we have done in the past. Today, we are also announcing a 7% increase to our 2022 annualized dividend in line with the top end of our operating EPS growth target.  
As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we retired the River Rouge power plant this year, and plan to retire Trenton Channel and St. Clair power plants in 2022. This is nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal retirements or 30% of our coal generation fleet. In this quarter, we made another significant step toward our goal of reducing carbon emissions. We announced that we'll be ceasing coal use of Belle River by 2028, 2 years earlier than originally planned, and preparing also to file an updated integrated resource plan in the fall of 2022, almost 1 year earlier than planned.  
We look forward to working with all stakeholders to address ways to further accelerate decarbonization, while always maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. In order to ensure we continue to have clean, reliable and affordable power for our customers, we have built or contracted for 2,500 megawatts of wind and solar energy, purchased 1,200 megawatts of natural gas peaker plants and expect our new state-of-the-art 1,100-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plant to be up and running in 2022 to coincide with our coal retirements.  
Now moving over to the nonutility side, we are renaming our Power and Industrial segment to DTE Vantage. Through our unique vantage point, we are helping customers transform the way their energy is produced and managed to be substantially cleaner and more efficient. The name DTE Vantage better reflects our position in bringing an innovative, cleaner energy solutions to our customers. Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our 5-year capital plan.  
Over the 5-year plan, our utilities continue to focus on our infrastructure investment agenda, especially investments in cleaner generation and investments to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our updated 5-year utility plan is $18 billion, which is $1 billion higher than the prior plan. Over 90% of our 5-year investment plan will be at our 2 utilities. Investments in our nonutility business are strategically focused on our customers' needs and aligns with our aggressive ESG initiatives. Overall, we have a robust total investment agenda of $19.5 billion over the next 5 years. And as always, we continue to look for ways to bring more capital into the plan to advance our clean vision plan and further improve reliability for our customers while maintaining affordability. 
Now let's turn to Slide 7. At DTE Electric, we announced our plan to accelerate decarbonization by ceasing coal use at the Belle River power plant by 2028, reducing carbon emissions by 50%, 2 years earlier than originally planned. This is another step toward our goal of net zero carbon emissions. Additionally, we expect to file our integrated resource plan in the fall of 2022, 1 year earlier than planned. By making this important generation decision now, DTE continues to accelerate our journey toward cleaner energy generation that is affordable and reliable for the customers and communities we serve.  
The $1 billion increase in our DTE Electric 5-year plan is driven by distribution infrastructure investments, preparing our grid for electrification and hardening initiatives and increased cleaner energy investment due to our voluntary renewable program, which is still exceeding our high expectations. This quarter, we have partnered with Washtenaw County, to build our first MIGreenPower solar project.  
Overall, the MIGreenPower program, which is one of the largest in the nation, continues to grow at an impressive rate. So far, we have reached over 950 megawatts of voluntary renewable commitments with large business customers and over 40,000 residential customers. We have an additional 400 megawatts in advanced stages of discussion with future customers. For our distribution infrastructure renewal, we are supporting electrification and load growth with infrastructure redesign, improving circuit reliability and reducing restoration times with system hardening and enabling a smarter grid with advanced technology and automation. This $15 billion investment over the next 5 years supports our long-term operating earnings growth of 7% to 8% at the electric company.  
And now let's discuss the opportunities at our gas utility on Slide 8. At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Earlier this year, we announced our new natural gas balance program. This program provides the opportunity for customers to purchase both carbon offsets and renewable natural gas to enable them offset up to 100% of the carbon from their natural gas usage. We are proud of how fast this program is growing. Earlier, we have over 4,000 customers subscribed, and we look forward to seeing it become as successful as our voluntary renewable program at DTE Electric.  
Overall, at DTE Gas, we are planning on investing $3 billion over the next 5 years to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure with potential upside to the plan of $500 million. Along with our pipeline integrity and main replacement investments, we are investing in innovative technology and products that will reduce methane emissions and the carbon footprint for our company. Overall, we expect our long-term operatings growth to be 9% at DTE Gas.  
Now let's turn to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, we renamed our P&I business to DTE Vantage. We are planning on investing between $1 billion to $1.5 billion at this segment over the next 5 years. We are targeting operating earnings of $85 million to $95 million in 2022, growing to $160 million to $170 million in 2026, with approximately 80% of the operating earnings in this business coming from decarbonization-related projects. As the REF business sunsets at the end of this year, we continue to see additional opportunities in renewable natural gas and industrial energy services. Earlier this year, we told you about a new RNG project in South Dakota, which is now under construction, and slated to start up in the second quarter of next year.  
We commenced construction on another Wisconsin RNG project in the third quarter and entered into an agreement for an additional RNG project, which will be our first project in New York. In aggregate, these 3 projects will serve the vehicle fuel market producing over 500,000 million BTUs of RNG per year, with 100% of the production offtake contracted long term. There has been strong RNG market growth, supported by the federal renewable fuel standard in California's low carbon fuel standard. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our growing preference for efficient energy with the opportunity to implement cogeneration systems, especially as manufacturing plants continue to open up nationwide. 
This also puts us in a very good position to explore additional decarbonization opportunities, including carbon capture and storage. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to give you a financial update. Dave, over to you."
266598,1684898936,2414258,"DTE Energy Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 10 to review our third quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $334 million. This translates into $1.72 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS b",978,"Thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Slide 10 to review our third quarter financial results. Total operating earnings for the quarter were $334 million. This translates into $1.72 per share. You can find a detailed breakdown of EPS by segment, including our reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings in the appendix. I'll start the review at the top of the page with our utilities. DTE Electric earnings were $342 million for the quarter. This was lower than the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to cooler weather in 2021 and higher storm costs, partially offset by higher commercial sales. 
Moving on to DTE Gas. Operating earnings were $10 million lower than the third quarter last year. The earnings decrease was driven primarily by higher O&M expenses and rate base growth cost partially offset by the rate implementation. Let's keep moving down the page to DTE Vantage on the third row. Operating earnings were $73 million. This was $26 million higher than the third quarter of 2020, driven primarily by REF earnings and new RNG projects. On the next row, you can see Energy Trading had another solid quarter, with operating earnings relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.  
Finally, Corporate and Other was unfavorable $39 million quarter-over-quarter. There are a couple of main drivers for this variance. The largest driver is the timing of taxes, which will reverse in the fourth quarter. We also had a onetime tax item true-up subsequent to the spin of DTE Midstream. As we look forward to the balance of the year, the tax timing adjustments for the first 3 quarters will result approximately a $50 million favorable reversal in the fourth quarter. So our full year 2021 results at Corporate and Other is expected to fall within our guidance for that segment. 
Overall, DTE has earned $1.72 per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2021. This represents a very strong third quarter and our year-to-date results put us in a great position for the year.  
Let's turn to Slide 11. As Jerry mentioned, we are raising the midpoint of our 2021 operating EPS guidance from $5.77 to $5.84 per share. Our revised operating EPS guidance range for 2021 is $5.70 to $5.98 per share. And with strong year-to-date performance, we expect our full year operating EPS to be biased towards the higher end of this range. This bias to the higher end also reflects the additional investment in reliability as we are investing $70 million to combat extreme weather-related power outages with no impact to our customer bills. Additionally, we've contemplated some further invest opportunities in our businesses during 2021, which positions DTE well for success in future years.  
Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss our 2022 outlook. We are continuing strong 5% to 7% long-term operating EPS growth through some significant milestones. We are converting $1.3 billion of mandatory equity in '22, and the REF business will sunset at the end of 2021. Through this, we will achieve 6% growth from 2021 original guidance. Our 2022 operating EPS early outlook midpoint is $5.84 per share, and we will work toward hitting the higher end of our range of $5.70 to $5.97 per share.  
In 2022, at DTE Electric growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments. DTE Gas will see continued customer-focused investments in main renewal and other infrastructure improvements to support our capital plan. As we discussed, 2021 is the final year of earnings for our reduced emission fuels business at DTE Vantage, approximately $90 million of REF earnings net of associated costs rolls off at the end of the year. This is offset by new project earnings in 2022. 2022 earnings at this segment are largely driven by continued RNG and industrial energy services projects that will serve as a base for growth going forward. At Corporate and Other, the biggest driver in our year-over-year improvement is lower interest expense. This is the result of leveraging earnings and cash strength in 2021 to opportunistically remarket some higher-priced debt. This will provide interest savings in 2022 and future years.  
Let's turn to Slide 13 to discuss our balance sheet and equity issuance plan and wrap up before taking your questions. We continue to focus on maintaining solid balance sheet metrics. Due to our strong cash flows, DTE has minimal equity issuances in our plan beyond the convertible equity units in 2022, while also increasing our 5-year capital investment plan by $1 billion. We have a strong investment-grade credit rating and target an FFO to debt of 16%. Additionally, we are increasing our 2022 dividend by 7% to $3.54 per share. In the third quarter, we completed our liability management plan following the spin of our midstream business. Using the funds raised from DTM's debt issuance, we repurchased a little over $2.6 billion of corporate debt and incurred approximately $400 million of debt breakage fees associated with the early retirement of the debt. Since this debt was allocated to the midstream business in our previous financial statements, you won't see a large decrease in the debt level at Corporate and Other. This liability management plan is NPV positive, EPS accretive, and further supports our long-term growth. 
So in summary, we feel great about our success so far this year and are confident in achieving our increased 2021 guidance. 2022 is looking good with 6% EPS growth from 2021 original guidance and our increased 5-year capital plan supports our 5% to 7% long-term growth while delivering cleaner generation and increased reliability for our customers. DTE continues to be well-positioned to deliver the premium total shareholder returns that our investors have come to expect over the past decade with strong utility growth and a dividend growing in line with EPS. With that, I thank you for joining us today, and we can open the line for questions."

As you mentioned, we're going to file an IRP in the fall of next year, and we're going to really use the next year to get a lot of feedback from interested stakeholders like the commission and other parties that will have an interest in our acceleration of coal retirements. As you know, the Monroe coal plant is slated to retire in 2040, but we are looking at many scenarios to pull that forward, Shar.  
So that will be -- become much more transparent when we file the IRP, the details of exactly how we're going to do that and also replace that baseload generation. It's over 3,000 megawatts of baseload generation. So we're going to have to think through very carefully how do we maintain reliability and affordability and get good feedback from our stakeholders.  
So what you see in the current 5-year outlook is an increase of about $1 billion in cleaner generation that's really driven primarily by our investments in voluntary renewables as well as some investments that we have on our [ Omtydro ] facility and a small hydrogen pilot perhaps at our Blue Water Energy Center."

And that will be -- the source of that will be our favorability in '21 that we're experiencing. The second thing you'll see is in our capital plan, we've raised our distribution infrastructure investment from $7 billion to $8 billion. In response to our detailed planning that we've put in front of the commission as it relates to resiliency to accommodate worsening weather patterns and also to accommodate the eventuality of the electrification of the transportation fleet. That's going to be a big deal for us in the second half of this decade.

So what stands in the way of getting incremental capital into the plan is really us finding affordability opportunities to offset the rate pressure that these investments would create, so that's what would bring it in, Jonathan. And so we'll continue to update that plan each and every year and try to bring more CapEx into the plan to accelerate our work as it relates to infrastructure renewal."

We do still expect to hit our guidance for Corp and Other for the quarter and our increased guidance for the year. But on the tax -- the onetime true-up, that was a valuation allowance that was against the tax reduction that we are carrying forward. And so when we had lower pretax earnings as a result of the spin, we looked at this differently and realized that we had to reduce that a little bit and there would be about an $18 million delta for that that was negative. Then on the tax timing, the effective tax rate, that's an adjustment that we do for GAAP. And it's just because as our pretax earnings and credits aren't earned ratably over the year, we have an entry at Corporate & Other that trues that up to the effective tax rate. And so that was about the same amount for the quarter. And then we had some of that from the first 3 quarters that all will reverse in the fourth quarter, and that will be the $50 million that we discussed that we'll see favorable in the fourth quarter."

In the '70s, we started to underground all new subdivisions and all new developments. So we have been underground for quite a few years. What remains above ground in residential neighborhoods primarily is infrastructure that's older than that. We've looked at and continue to look at ways to strategically underground. But it is very expensive. So you have to be very strategic about how you do it. So just to give you an idea about 7 or 8 years ago, I was asked by a mayor of one of the communities that we serve, whether we could underground the whole system. And it was a community of 14,000 residents and the cost to underground was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost to trim those circuits was $200,000 or $300,000 and which would give us about 95% of the same reliability impact. So it's, again, undergrounding is great. I think we have to approach it in a strategic manner. That is a question that we're addressing in our distribution plan, 5-year plan that we put in front of the commission and we'll continue to work to find ways -- strategic ways to underground. But it is very cost prohibitive to take existing systems and underground them and also disruptive to our customers. In a sense that the locations where you have to underground, you have to remove the trees, tear up front lines and drive ways as well as backyards potentially when systems are in people's backyards."
