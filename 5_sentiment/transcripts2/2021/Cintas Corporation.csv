The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues and it remains a significant disruption to the economy.

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter, which included the months of December, January and February, was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of a little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after 7 straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas. 
Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remains strong, and our employee-partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19. 
Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for an improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. 
Regardless of the operating environment, our employee-partners work with urgency to get businesses Ready for the Workday. Companies want to open their doors every day with confidence that they're ready for their employees and their customers. We help businesses achieve that objective by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. 
For over 90 years, Cintas has accomplished getting businesses Ready for the Workday in numerous ways, including providing hygienically clean uniforms to auto manufacturers, for example, so that the workers can safely build their cars; restroom supplies and services to professional services firms, so bathrooms are ready for use by employees and clients; hygienically laundered towels at coffee chains so baristas can serve their coffee lovers; first aid products to restaurants to address the cuts and burns of the kitchen crew; and test inspection and repair services of fire extinguishers and alarm systems to facilities managers to protect employees and customers from danger. 
The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in for businesses a new era of readiness. Getting Ready for the Workday today also includes taking actions to prevent and reduce transmission of viruses and bacteria. Our solutions for getting businesses Ready for the Workday include providing hygienically clean scrubs to dentist offices because hygienists feel vulnerable taking them home to launder. Sanitizing spray services and disinfected lights for food manufacturers, for instance, so that they can routinely sterilize surfaces. Hand sanitizer dispensing units to universities so employees, professors and students can keep their hands clean. Masks and gloves to city, county and state governments to protect employees when interacting with the public and hygienically cleaned isolation gowns to hospitals to safeguard caregivers from the contaminants of the set. 
Our value proposition of helping businesses get Ready for the Workday has arguably never been more relevant. Every business has a need that Cintas can help fulfill. And in this unpredictable environment, requiring new and increased demands, businesses appreciate the certainty of Cintas. The Cintas tagline of Ready for the Workday helps describe what we do. It also helps describe who we are. Our employees, whom we call partners, are always Ready for the Workday, whether it's in the best of times or in the most uncertain of times. Our partners are honored to be deemed essential. They are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems and ready to be counted on to deliver, and they do. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results."

Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue",822,"Mike? Thank you, Scott. Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%. 
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite 1 less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year. 
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. 
Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt-to-EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week, on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. 1 more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. 1 more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on year-over-year and sequential basis. 
For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion, and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases. 
We're encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus and business reopenings and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day-adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5% after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results. 
Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth, will benefit in part from an easier comparison. 
Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses, and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory, mostly in the Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely impacted industries, such as airlines and hotels, exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter. 
I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses."

Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on-ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. 
The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 3.5%. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions."

I'd start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the P&L. How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean, we've learned an awful lot. We don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is traveling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but a lot of that probably won't. 
But I'd say that in our -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, I think, improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back onto the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division, as an example, jobs that would help us with growth, additional sales people, sales training, additional headcount in production operations to be able to process things. So I wouldn't expect a linear improvement but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins as we add sales and volume back on to the P&L. And over time, I think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above probably above where we were pre-pandemic. So that's how I would answer that. Does that help you?"

We don't see that as repeating that level -- repeating in Q4. But we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level -- elevated level of those types of products and services. 
As far as restaurants, et cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks' activities increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that. And we sure hope that the small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm that their demand starts to pick up even more. So we're encouraged by what we see."

It wasn't just a Rental lift. But relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year. This year was as well. It has 2 holidays in it with Christmas and New Year's, and our customers sometimes take multiple days off, depending on what day those holidays fall on. There's always the potential of weather issues with snow and ice storms and things like that. And both of those things happened this year. And if you combine that with the increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. 
I would say, if we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in 7 months in December. So December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment. But as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenue start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say maybe the second week in January. The expected restrictions that governors that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so the -- we built some momentum in February that we continue to see as we moved into March. And I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter."

Just on the Fire business, I know it's a smaller business for you, but it's a good business. Could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about scaling that business up?

There are a lots and lots and lots of small independent players. There are regional players. There are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups. So there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service, be it fire extinguisher, repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They have different certification levels that they have to have. So it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street. And us being able to train them to be a first aid service rep, these people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. 
But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into. And there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. So we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be upsized. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least $1 billion in revenue. And that's what they should be thinking about and that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth. But we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over $1 billion in revenue for us."

I mean, in normal times, we have a pretty good sense about how that contributes to your year-over-year growth rate. Now that the next few quarters are going to be driven more by a reopening type growth rate. I was wondering if you could talk about which of those factors you think will contribute more than the historical percentage to the growth and maybe less, just to understand how you're thinking about how this matters and will unfold in the next few months, quarters?"

I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22 is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter this year and into our second quarter, that certainly took a pause. But we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. 
And so I think as we look at the next couple of quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of a held status in the Rental division. We'll start to service first aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So I think it's going to be more of that, the reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else."

I think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly, in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices and costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year. And there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. 
But Andrew, the really good news in all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so many times, we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned we have not like that idea in the last year. We did not think it's the right thing to do, but -- and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually, in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs, if we can't offset them within our operations."

So I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. 
We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continue to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public. And obviously, that is a street that we'd like to see continue. 
And then yes, finally, we do have roughly $1 billion left on our authorization, and that is more sort of opportunistic from time to time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a position to buy back some of our stock.

Once we put the standout there, we come in service it on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through until their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks and things like that are the onetime PPE sale, refer to it as onetime. But it's more of a direct sale that can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. 
But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography. It depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-type businesses. They've increased headcount, increased number of wearers. We -- other businesses have reduced the number of wearers. So it's a little bit all over the board, trying to put some parameter on that. Relative to historical average, I'd say, recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of of hand sanitizer and that's why it's flat through the quarter. And we think that, that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully, bring back some of their headcount. And I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business like hand sanitizer is here to stay. 
I have said in the past, and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theater, any place and isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they've grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums. We're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations and that sort of thing. I think that's going to be here to stay. So if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue. As they add people back on, that's what revenue on top of where they are right now."

And as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port. So the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now, particularly sort of vacation travel. So the hotels are doing a little bit better. The airlines are starting to pick up. And when I say that, I mean, their revenue streams to their -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a pretty significant number. 
And I think that those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer traveling. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So I think there is a, as Todd said, a pent-up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, get on an airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S. population has a vaccine. How long will it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it might take a couple of years, but I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now."

First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a sort of a favor to the customer. But from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things, depending on a customer-by-customer basis, but a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So we help them with adjustments on their invoices, maybe their entrance mats went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. 
And it's -- to us, it's the relationship that we have with a customer. We believe we enhance their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these type of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the Great Recession, we had the experience of doing things then as well. And the lifetime value of the customers we come out of this is significant. They like us. They're willing to -- they trust us. They're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth, and are less likely, we think, to listen to a competitor's offer. And that all goes into what we would use to make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. 
So from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming up on 2 years since we last increased. Generally speaking, last increased our prices on our recurring revenue. And that's particularly in the Rental division, where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors, typical environment. Pricing environment in our business is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers' attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors' bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. 
We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need, we -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to them about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. 
Will that happen in the near future? That I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At the pace that we're on right now, I would assume that between that, the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will happen. When, I'm not ready to predict."

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues, and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter, which included the months of December, January and February, was particularly challen",732,"Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. 
The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues, and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter, which included the months of December, January and February, was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of a little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after 7 straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas.  
Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19.  
Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for an improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong. So fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon.  
Regardless of the operating environment, our employee-partners work with urgency to get businesses Ready for the Workday. Companies want to open their doors every day with confidence that they're ready for their employees and their customers. We help businesses achieve that objective by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best.  
For over 90 years, Cintas has accomplished getting businesses Ready for the Workday in numerous ways, including providing hygienically clean uniforms to auto manufacturers, for example, so that the workers can safely build their cars; restroom supplies and services to professional services firms, so bathrooms are ready for use by employees and clients; hygienically laundered towels at coffee chains, so baristas can serve their coffee lovers; first aid products to restaurants to address the cuts and burns of the kitchen crew; and test inspection and repair services of fire extinguishers and alarm systems to facilities managers to protect employees and customers from danger.  
The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in for businesses a new era of readiness. Getting Ready for the Workday today also includes taking actions to prevent and reduce transmission of viruses and bacteria. Our solutions for getting businesses Ready for the Workday include: providing hygienically clean scrubs to dentist offices because hygienists feel vulnerable taking them home to launder; sanitizing spray services and disinfectant wipes for food manufacturers, for instance, so that they can routinely sterilize surfaces; hand sanitizer dispensing units to universities so employees, professors and students can keep their hands clean; masks and gloves to city, county and state governments to protect employees when interacting with the public; and hygienically clean isolation gowns to hospitals to safeguard caregivers from the contaminants of the sick.  
Our value proposition of helping businesses get Ready for the Workday has arguably never been more relevant. Every business has a need that Cintas can help fulfill. And in this unpredictable environment, requiring new and increased demands, businesses appreciate the certainty of Cintas. The Cintas tagline of Ready for the Workday helps describe what we do. It also helps describe who we are. Our employees, whom we call partners, are always Ready for the Workday, whether it's in the best of times or in the most uncertain of times. Our partners are honored to be deemed essential. They are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems and ready to be counted on to deliver. And they do. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results. Mike?"

Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter.

Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. 
The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%.  
Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite 1 less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year.  
Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. 
Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20.  
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter.  
Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt-to-EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week, on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. 
For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is 1 more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to 1 more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on year-over-year and sequential basis.  
For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases.  
We're encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus and business reopenings, and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day-adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5% after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results.  
Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth, will benefit in part from an easier comparison.  
Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory mostly in the Uniform Direct Sales business where customers in some of the most severely impacted industries, such as airlines and hotels, exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter.  
I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses."

Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. 
Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. 
The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line, and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic.  
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 3.5%. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic.

How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean we've learned an awful lot. We don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is traveling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but a lot of that probably won't.  
But I'd say that in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to I think improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division. As an example, jobs that would help us with growth, additional sales people, sales training, additional headcount in production operations to be able to process things. 
So I wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins as we add sales and volume back on to the P&L.

It has 2 holidays in it with Christmas and New Year's; and our customers sometimes take multiple days off, depending on what day those holidays fall on. There's always the potential of weather issues with snow and ice storms and things like that. And both of those things happened this year. And if you combine that with the increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does.  
I would say, if we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in 7 months in December. So December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment.  But as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenue start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions that governors that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. 
And so the -- we built some momentum in February that we continue to see as we moved into March. And I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter."

Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of pandemic, right? But if there is any silver linings, it's the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them and, as Scott mentioned, that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more products and services our customers procure from us, the more value we're bringing to that. And we think that is very positive. 
The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulty fighting for the pandemic. And as a result of that, again, our customers have really appreciated that and it's really positioned us well for the future.

There are lots and lots and lots of small, independent players. There are regional players. There are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups. So there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. 
One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service, be it fire extinguisher, repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They have different certification levels that they have to have. So it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street. And us being able to train them to be a first aid service rep, these people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. 
But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into. And there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. 
So we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be upsized. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least $1 billion in revenue. And that's what they should be thinking about. And that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth. But we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over $1 billion in revenue for us."

I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22 is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter this year and into our second quarter, that certainly took a pause. But we've got a lot of customers that still are either not open or at limited capacity. 
And so I think as we look at the next couple of quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of a held status in the Rental division. We'll start to service first aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important.

So I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about where inflation could hit you, where you might be seeing it today or expect to see it tomorrow. Obvious areas come to mind like energy and I'd be curious as to your thoughts on how that impacts the outlook here for calendar '21, but also maybe even in some of the products that you're selling in the ancillary business and then first aid, labor, obviously. If you could just address inflation, how you affect -- how do you expect to affect you and your ability to recover it in pricing against a recovering but still not a full bore macro?"

And the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly, in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices and costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year. And there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. 
But Andrew, the really good news in all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so many times, we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned we have not like that idea in the last year. We did not think it's the right thing to do, but -- and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually, in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs, if we can't offset them within our operations."

We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses.

Once we put the standout there, we come and service it on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through until their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks and things like that are the onetime PPE sale refer to it as onetime, but it's more of a direct sale that can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. 
But we have -- we -- a lot of it depends on geography. It depends on the industry that the customer is in. Some distribution-type businesses, they've increased headcount, increased number of wearers. We -- other businesses have reduced the number of wearers. So it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that.  
Relative to historical average, I'd say, recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's why it's flat through the quarter. And we think that, that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully, bring back some of their headcount. And I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business like hand sanitizer is here to stay. 
I have said in the past and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theater, any place and isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they've grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums. We're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations and that sort of thing. I think that's going to be here to stay. 
So if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue. As they add people back on, that's what revenue on top of where they are right now."

We think that there is an incredible amount of pent-up demand that is in the marketplace. You add that with stimulus checks. And we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that will be really positive. 
If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly -- the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment.

And as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port. So the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now, particularly sort of vacation travel. So the hotels are doing a little bit better. The airlines are starting to pick up. And when I say that, I mean their revenue streams to their -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a pretty significant number. 
And I think that the -- those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer traveling. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. 
So I think there is a -- as Todd said, a pent-up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, get on an airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S. population has a vaccine. How long will it take to get back to pre-COVID? That, I don't know. It might take a couple of years, but I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now."

And we were doing all kin",602,"Scott, thanks for that question. First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a sort of a favor to the customer. But from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic. And we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things depending on a customer-by-customer basis, but a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So we help them with adjustments on their invoices, maybe their entrance mats went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. 
And it's -- to us, it's the relationship that we have with a customer. We believe we enhance their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these type of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the Great Recession. We had the experience of doing things then as well. And the lifetime value of the customer as we come out of this is significant. They like us. They're willing to -- they trust us. They're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer. And that all goes into what we would use to make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. 
So from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming up on 2 years since we last increased -- generally speaking, last increased our prices on our recurring revenue. And that's particularly in the Rental division where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors, typical environment, pricing environment in our business is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers' attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors' bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. 
We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need. We -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to them about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. 
Will that happen in the near future? That, I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At the pace that we're on right now, I would assume that between that, the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will happen. When, I'm not ready to predict."

The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment declined 6.8%. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. 
Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2% EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5x debt to EBITDA at May 31, 2021. On June 1, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends.
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years. 
Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75.
Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform.
We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic-related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter.

The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses reopening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First Aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid cabinet service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter.
The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard-to-find and potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes.
Our Net Promoter scores reached an all-time high because we consistently deliver for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at #410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies.
We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million.
As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements.
The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns.
Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get Ready for the Workday. Examples include: scrubber rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms; floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers; first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns; fire protection services to facilities managers and universities; and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments.
The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including: hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops; cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels; first aid cabinet services; personal protective equipment; and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Our total addressable market is the 15 million to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. Every business, both producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway.
Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in 3 main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cellphone, to access data and process transactions real-time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to longer plant stock inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue-producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory.
Second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order-to-cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross-selling and pricing opportunities.
And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue.
I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year.
And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman."

And what I heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was that it sounds like you're getting good operating leverage, but I was just hoping you could drill in and talk about some of the key factors you've talked about in the past. Certainly, labor is one that's come up a lot broadly across the street. You've talked about some other things like health care travel. And others are mentioning merchandise costs. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets and talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly. And so I was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in."

And you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to.
And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of -- people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future."

But I don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems, but we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely."

Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they're doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which are doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. And -- but we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully, some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in.

You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are -- we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing. And those things will all have positive impacts.
From a material cost standpoint, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must -- they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt.
And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they'll continue to do a very good job.
Now having said that, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And -- but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer-by-customer decision. And where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon."

And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, George. And -- but there is a strong audience for the -- our sales partners and in whom they're calling on, partly because there were some items that you -- when people were going through the pandemic, they said, ""Hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need some critical products to help my business run."" We provided those critical products and services and has positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where we say, ""Okay. Now I'm ready to talk about those types of items."" 
So all that is positive for us. As we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business."

We've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to security 20 years ago.

So we see that as something that will be elevated into the future. And we think that's good for society. That's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity.
As far as PPE normalization, there is -- there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases, couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, first aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. 
Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services. It's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera.

I just wanted to -- you mentioned first aid specifically, too, so I just want to make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said -- alluded to, it's in a transition period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters.
What I want to make sure everybody understands is that first aid business is getting back to that more reoccurring revenue stream with that cabinet service business, which we are very excited about. And to think about a 9% or high single-digit type of a growth rate for first aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance.
And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single-digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that cabinet service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the first aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't get back all the way to pre COVID levels in terms of margins in first aid because, just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those candidates."

Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that business?
And the question then on revenue. On the rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps. You've had sequential improvement throughout last year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. And I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Is -- did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off? And is that a drag?

So as the year goes on, the PPE will -- the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. 
As far as the rental, yes, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that -- in our results from last year in rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would have repeat, but we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into -- the number would [indiscernible] more than 8% as far as internal growth.

Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures in that it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first.
But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, Uniform Rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops. That was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products. Those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%. Linens 10%. And the catalog business, which is more like the direct -- small direct sales component of the rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%.
So then this year's mix, Uniform Rental 48%, dust 17%, hygiene, 17%, shop towels 4%, linens 9% and catalog 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom-type items, so air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing, sprays, et cetera.

The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot, I mean, a lot of that spending and that -- some of the major expense is behind us. And it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toys, so to speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously."

Our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.62 billion in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. Earnings per diluted share, or EPS, were $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment declined 6.8%.  
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20.  
Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remains strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5x debt to EBITDA at May 31, 2021. On June 1, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends. 
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years.  
Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. 
Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. 
We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic-related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter. 
I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses."

The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on [ raft ].
Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses reopening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid cabinet service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. 
The first aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage. While profitable,  personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. 
Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points.

We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and ready for the workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard-to-find and potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. 
Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently deliver for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at #410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. 
We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million. 
As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. 
I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns. 
Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the workday. Examples include scrub rental to hospitals and dentists; hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms; floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers; first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns; fire protection services to facilities managers and universities; and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments. 
The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops; cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels; first aid cabinet services; personal protective equipment; and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. 
Our total addressable market is the 15 million to 20 million businesses we don't currently service.  
Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill. 
Additionally, the COVID pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway. 
Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in 3 main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cellphone, to access data and process transactions real-time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stockroom inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue-producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory. 
The second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order-to-cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross-selling and pricing opportunities. 
And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue. 
I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year. 
And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman."

I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets and talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly.

And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. 
And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of -- people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue.

And so we'll be watching that very closely."

Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they're doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which we're doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. And -- but we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully, some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in.

You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are -- we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing. And those things will all have positive impacts.
From a material cost standpoint, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must -- they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt.
And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they'll continue to do a very good job.
Now having said that, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And -- but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer-by-customer decision. And where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon."

As far as PPE normalization, there is -- there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases, couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, first aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. 
Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services. It's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them.

And to think about a 9% or a high single-digit type of a growth rate for first aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance.
And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single-digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that cabinet service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the first aid business in fiscal '22.

We expect continued good performance in our fire business as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year.

Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that business?
And the question then on revenue. On the rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps. You've had sequential improvement throughout last year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. And I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Is -- did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off? And is that a drag?

As Mike stated, Q4 last year, Q1 -- excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the first aid business as was Q1. So the comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will -- the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. 
As far as the rental, yes, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that -- in our results from last year in rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the -- the number would start with an 8 as far as internal growth.
So how far into the 8s? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened in many cases.

And I would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures in that it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first.
But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, uniform rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%. Linens, 10%. And the catalog business, which is more like the direct -- small direct sales component of the rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%.
So then this year's mix, uniform rental; 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene, 17%; shop towels, 4%; linens, 9%; and catalog, 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom-type items, so some air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing, sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded.

So we're looking out for them from that S perspective of the ESG as well."

We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, friendlines",685,"Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, friendliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them ready for the work day. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state. But we also made solid progress on a sequential basis and in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continue to make measured investments to support our growth. 
The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, reduce efficiencies and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs. 
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment or PPE sales were surging, propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix that was pre-COVID. 
Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid Cabinet Service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid Cabinet Service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts. 
Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. 
I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically-clean garments such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services. 
Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. 
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sales business. 
Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. 
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. 
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. 
We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion, to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion. And diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75, to a range of $10.60 to $10.90. 
Please note the following regarding our guidance: fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. 
Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surging COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns. 
Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results: in last fiscal year second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of 18 -- the pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other."

Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was, that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stall it out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So there's a little bit of a tail there. 
But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. 
As far as the other areas, health care continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks. 
And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the health care institutions and many institutions to say, ""Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use."" So again, that value proposition is very much resonating."

It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully, will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID, as an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels. 
In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels. And I think we're a representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID.

Or how should we think about pricing strategy?"

Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than others. And we're conscious of that. 
But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint, it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and we handle them appropriately."

Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us. And that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. 
We get some other -- certainly advantaged from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net zero emissions. And we see we can advance that subject, advance all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting. 
The other item is with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it myCintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine-to-five type model. So those are significant for us. 
Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain, is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming."

And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far. 
The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. 
And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works."

Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- excuse me, more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that, that relationship will be just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth. 
So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs, our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide. 
So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organizations but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get the message out about all the products and services we provide.

That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure. 
When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. 
The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell, certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities."

But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double digits. And so it's a pretty good year. 
And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of say that our guidance is based on share buyback and taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. 
The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance."

And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. 
Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. 
One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet.

That is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward. 
In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there."

And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. 
And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us."

First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, friendliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market.
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state. But we also made solid progress on a sequential basis and in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continue to make measured investments to support our growth.
The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, reduce efficiencies and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs.
Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or PPE, sales were surging, propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix that was pre-COVID.
Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because first aid cabinet service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent.
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from the increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts.
Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return.
I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items, such as face masks and gloves; to provide hygienically clean garments, such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns; and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services.
Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability.
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale.
Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business.
Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21.
Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense.
Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter.
We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion, to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion. And diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75, to a range of $10.60 to $10.90.
Please note the following regarding our guidance: fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surging COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns.
Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results: in last fiscal year's second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other."

Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stall it out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So there's a little bit of a tail there.
But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back.
As far as the other areas, health care continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks.
And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the health care institutions and many institutions to say, ""Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use.""

It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully, will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID. As an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels.
In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels. And I think we're a representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID.

Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us and that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward.
We get some other, certainly, advantage from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net-zero emissions. And we see that we can advance that subject, advance up all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting.
The other item is, with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional 9-to-5 type model. So those are significant for us.
Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and -- faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming."

And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far.
The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us.
And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job, and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works."

Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- or excuse me, the more products and services we provide to the customer, we know that stickier that relationship will be, just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth.
So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer, virtually, needs our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need First Aid and Safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide.
So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us.

That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure.
When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type, like the restroom products that we expense immediately.
The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell, certainly a large part of our structure.

You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today, is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double digits. And so it's a pretty good year.
And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of say that our guidance is based on share buyback and taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance."

We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels.
Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum.
One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out over the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our first aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year. Every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business."

And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully.

Our second quarter financial results were led by our strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers. 
The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million tax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that we -- they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high. 
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging. However, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections. 
Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday. And it is not worth that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%. 
Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE, were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE compressed an outsized percentage of First Aid end Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix that was pre-COVID. 
Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. 
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment. 
Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. 
Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability. The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. [indiscernible] support further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage.

Our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. 
Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth. 
Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year. Operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. 
Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million, compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. 
We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. 
Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks. And guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or costs necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. 
Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range."

Gross margin in -- in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year. So -- but as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. 
The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year, there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. 
And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work, right? It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work, right? However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. 
All that said, as we know, inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.

So obviously, investing in technology is 1 of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage. I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. 
We have launched what we call Smart Tech -- excuse me, Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops. And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. 
So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. 
So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online.

I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. And so productivity is very strong. 
Efficiencies, look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly. And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year.

And so if you take that, that was all recorded in SG&A within rental. If you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year. So a 90 basis point improvement. So some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. 
Look, we've been in the rental business above 20% for the last 6 quarters. And our expectation is we're going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some some ups and downs periodically, but generally speaking, look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment.

So about 2/3 of our -- the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programs. Some people in different industry call the unvended. Nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program and when they walk out, we do. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that net-net. That being said, that's simply the uniform market. Our other markets are just a vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- or excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. Same way with the First Aid business. 
And in the Fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services. So yes, I think we're an incredibly good position in all those because of the market size.

Now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guest, patients, those types of things. And as a result, we think that's good for the First Aid business.

And they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. 
And I just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on providing that value to the customers. When we walk in, and I'll just give uniforms an example. When we walk in 1 of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, I didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. So they're surprised. 
One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, oh, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. 
So we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. And there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now. So being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people.

Our second quarter financial results were led by our strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers.  
The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million tax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that we -- they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high.  
Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging, however, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections.  
Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday. And it is noteworthy that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%.  
Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE, were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE compressed an outsized percentage of First Aid end Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID.  
Over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE.  
Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment.  
Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return.  
Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We're committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and maintaining accountability. The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
Our ESG report further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage.

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year.  
Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth.  
Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year. Operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. 
Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million, compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. 
We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. 
Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks. 
And guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or costs necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. 
Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range."

Gross margin in -- in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year. So -- but as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. 
The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year, there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. 
And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work, right? It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work, right? However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. 
All that said, as we know, inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.

So obviously, investing in technology is one of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage. I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. 
We have launched what we call smart tech -- excuse me, Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops. And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. 
So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. 
So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online. All these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace being easier to do business with, and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with."

And roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year, and that is we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. If we did hit 19.5% that I talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60 basis point improvement in the back half of the year. That's coming on top of, I'll call it, gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. And you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a 0 to 70 basis point improvement. And the performance through midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that initial guide. 
And so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. But generally speaking, your assessment is fair, Andy. Pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago."

Productivity improvements, I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity. Productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation and so productivity is very strong. 
Efficiencies, look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly. And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. 
And so margin improvement, I think we can throw it in those 4 buckets and it's -- I would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors."

One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, oh, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people.
