I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And then I'll hand it over to CFO, Marc Naughton; and our new Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton; an",930,"Well, thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And then I'll hand it over to CFO, Marc Naughton; and our new Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton; and then our President, Don Trigg, for some more marketplace commentary. 
Well, 2020 was a remarkable year for all of us. And given circumstances, Cerner delivered solid results by executing on our plans and really focusing on supporting our clients. The pandemic challenge Cerner and our clients on several fronts, we continue to be extremely proud to support clients who are battling COVID on the front lines each and every day. And we're very pleased with the way our associates seamlessly transitioned to a remote work environment last March and have really remained productive and focused on our client success throughout this whole period. 
I'm also proud that Cerner recently began hosting a series of massive vaccination events at our world headquarters. This is done through a collaboration with North Kansas City Hospital, Liberty Hospital, Clay County Public health center in cities within Clay County. This initiative called Operation Safe is being staffed by volunteers from Cerner, North Kansas City Hospital and several partners in the community. 
And together, we've vaccinated nearly 5,000 people through 1 week, and we have additional events planned in the weeks ahead. And I've often said that centers on Seres strongest assets is how mission-driven our people are. And the willingness of our associates to rise to the challenge of this pandemic has really presented a strong demonstration of that commitment throughout the whole year. 
In addition to supporting our clients and communities, we continue to advance our growth strategies and make operational improvements as part of Cerner's ongoing transformation in 2020. As Covid accelerated health care macro trends, it also validated our growth initiatives, including the creation and expansion of health networks, our real-time health system capabilities in consumer-facing health strategies. 
Cerner is providing data-driven insights that can improve our clients' clinical, operational and financial outcomes. Our recent investment in Elligo Health Research in agreement to acquire Kantar Health, are examples of how we're deploying capital to advance Cerner's growth strategies. And Don will provide more detail about how these investments accelerate Cerner's presence in life sciences and create a strong foundation for our Data-as-a-Service business. 
We also continue toward our transformation goals. Cerner's transformation has been focused on simplifying the business, creating operational efficiencies and delivering profitable growth. And we're nearing $300 million in annualized cost reductions since beginning our transformation efforts about 2 years ago. And we believe those efficiencies and our resilient business model really helped mitigate the impacts of COVID on our business. 
As part of our portfolio management process, we simplified our product set to go from offering more than 25,000 features to really fewer than 400 products. And we also divested RevWorks outsourcing business in some noncore global assets. Importantly, our work to deliver seamless care for 18 million Cerner members and veterans remains on track. And for the first time in history, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Coast Guard are using the same electronic health record. And the number of patients in our Joint health information exchange grew from $700,000 to $4 million since April of last year. 
Finally, we supported the evolution and transformation of our business by adding proven leaders who are already bringing a new perspective.  Chief Technology Officer, Jerome Labat, joined us in June, bringing more than 30 years of CTO and product development experience at Fortune 500 and leading global tech companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intuit and Oracle. 
In September, Chief Strategy Officer, Will Mince, came to Cerner after working with leading health care and technology businesses, including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield. You probably know Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton, from his leadership in our federal business. And we're excited to have Travis now bringing that same leadership to our global client base, while retaining oversight of our critically important federal work. Mark Ersek is our most recent appointment and will replace long time Cerner's CFO, Mark Naughton, on February 22. Mark is a high energy leader, who will bring more than 25 years of financial leadership experience, including driving transformation across complex global operations and leveraging balance sheets to drive growth and shareholder value. 
In addition to those leaders, we are also honored to have major General Elder Granger joined the Cerner Board of Directors in November. And Dr. Granger is a proven leader with experiences in clinical, military and business environments. And before I close, I'd like to acknowledge that this is our last earnings call with CFO, Marc Naughton, who after nearly 30 years of service and 101 earnings calls, will be leaving Cerner at the end of the first quarter. I know many of you share my appreciation for Mark and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. And Mark, I just have to say, I cannot imagine anything more fun than 101 earnings calls. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in 2020. We delivered toward our revised expectations while driving -- driving a significant amount of change in what we all have to say was a very unusual year in health care. It was very hard work. And I sincerely appreciate all Cerner associates in their contributions to this progress. And Mark, let me now turn it over to you for call number 101."
259627,700829337,2203138,"Cerner Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brent. They always say the second 100 is the easiest. So sure, that's true. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover Q4 results and future guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics in line with our expectations. I'll start with bo",2254,"Thanks, Brent. They always say the second 100 is the easiest. So sure, that's true. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover Q4 results and future guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics in line with our expectations. 
I'll start with bookings, which were $1.68 billion, over $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Full year bookings were $5.585 billion, which is down from $5.99 billion in 2019, primarily driven by the impact of pandemic and divestitures of our commercial RevWorks and certain global businesses in Q3. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $13.04 billion, which is down 5% from a year ago due primarily to the impact of divestitures. 
Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from the ASC 606 backlog definition, still provides visibility to more than 85% of expected revenue over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter of $1.395 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range and represents roughly 1% year-over-year growth after adjusting for divestitures. Total revenue for the year was $5.506 billion, which also reflects approximately 1% growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures. 
I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '19 and full year 2019. The licensed software revenue in Q4 was flat year-over-year at $174 million. Full year licensed software revenue declined 4% from 2019 to $656 million due to pandemic-driven declines in traditional software partially offset by growth in software and service revenue, which now makes up approximately 60% of total software revenue. 
To date, this shift has been driven primarily by growth in SaaS revenue related to healthy intent-based solutions. Going forward, we expect this shift to continue for additional factors and -- for additional factors to contribute, including changes this year in how we deliver in contracts for Careaware and community works. Given the relatively small sizes of these businesses, the impact of the changes will not be significant. We expect to use this transition as a guide for a broader move to SaaS with Millennium, which will occur as we continue to advance our platform and modernization. 
Technology resale in Q4 was down 8% year-over-year to $56 million and in line with our expectations. Full year technology resale revenue was down 20% to $197 million, primarily due to a tough overall environment for technology resale and the impact of the pay and debt. Subscriptions revenue grew 6% Q4 of $98 million and grew 5% for the full year to $378 million. Professional services revenue was down 6% in Q $4 million to $478 million and was down 3% for the full year to $1.93 billion due primarily to the impact of the pandemic divestitures, the termination of our large revenue agreement in 2019 and lower third-party services. 
Declines driven by these factors were partially offset by continued strength in federal professional services. Managed services was up 2% in Q4, $317 million and up 3% for the full year to $1.245 billion. Support maintenance of $263 million was down 4% in Q4 and down 3% for the full year to $1.071 billion due to the impact of divestitures, attrition and reduced hardware maintenance revenue. And finally, reimbursed travel of $8 million was down 63% in Q4, down 71% for the full year at $28 million due to pandemic driven travel restrictions. 
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was down 3% from the year ago quarter at $1.23 billion and non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was also down 3% from the year ago quarter due primarily due to the divestiture of assets in Germany and Spain. For the full year, domestic revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue declined 4% due to the impact of the pandemic as well as divestitures..
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was up 240 basis points from a year ago to 83.2% and and full year was up 190 basis points over 2019 to 83.1, reflecting improved revenue mix due to less outsourcing, third-party services, technology resale and reimbursed travel. 
Now I will discuss spending, operating margin, net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP adjusted and non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19 related expense and allowance on a noncurrent asset, gains on the sale of business and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. 
Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $987 million were basically flat compared to $982 million in the year ago quarter. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $2.879 billion, down 4% from $4.021 billion in 2019. The our adjusted operating expenses of $860 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared to Q4 of '19 and full year 2020 decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued cost optimization efforts. Divestitures and lower travel expense. Looking at the line items for Q4, sales and client service expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by lower nonpersonnel expense and divestitures. Software development expense increased 4% from Q4 of '19, with gross R&D up 6% and a slight increase in net capitalized software. G&A expense in Q4 was down 9%, driven by a decline in both personnel and nonpersonnel expenses. 
Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7%, flat to the year ago period. Our GAAP operating margin for the quarter 2020 was 16.6% compared to 10.6% in 2019. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up from 20.3% in Q4 of 19 and 20.4% last quarter, reflecting the impact of our cost optimization efforts and improved revenue mix. 
Our full year adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, representing 140 basis points full year margin expansion over 2019. And we're happy with our operating margin including in 2020 given the circumstances and expect to continue improving margins as we deliver ongoing optimization efforts and aim to realize a longer-term benefit from platform modernization. 
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $142 million or $0.46 per diluted share, down from $0.49 in Q4 of '19. The full year GAAP net earnings were $780 million or $2.52 per diluted share and includes gains from divestitures and investment sales. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $241 million adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, up 4% compared to 75% -- $0.75 in Q4 of '19. 
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $879 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.84, up 6% in 2019 Our GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and 20% for the full year. For 2021, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the 21% to 22% range. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.06 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.34 billion of debt. Our receivables ended the year at $1.17 billion, down $50 million from last quarter. Our Q4 DSO was 76 days, which is down from 81 days in Q3 '20 and up from 72 days in the year ago period. Looking forward, we expect DSO to remain in the 70s. 
Operating cash flow in Q4 was very strong at $513 million. Capital expenditures were $46 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow was a record high of $396 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.437 billion. Capital expenditures were $284 million and capitalized software was $295 million. Full year free cash flow was $857 million, which is up $290 million from 2019, driven by solid operating cash flow and nearly $200 million reduction in capital expenditures. 
For 2021, we expect an increase in free cash flow driven by operating cash flow growth, continued CapEx control. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the Carriers Act payroll tax deferral ending and an increase -- an expected increase in capitalized software-related to some focused use of third-party developers to assist with platform modernization work. In total, these 2 items are expected to impact free cash flow by about $150 million, with over 3/4 being tied to payroll taxes. 
Moving to capital allocation. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Kantar Health for $375 million in cash, subject to adjustment. As Don will discuss, this acquisition is strong complement to our existing Data as a Service efforts and represents a meaningful entry to the pharmaceutical market. We expect the transition to close in the second quarter. 
We also resumed our share repurchase program in Q4 and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million. This brings our total for the year to 10.6 million shares repurchased or $757 million, an average price of $71.07 per share and leaves us with $927 million remaining on our current authorization. Subject to Board approval, we currently expect to repurchase up to $1 billion-plus this year, with the exact amount depending on the amount of cash used for other purposes such as acquisitions beyond the previously discussed Kantar Health deal. 
Moving to our dividend program. In October, we paid a dividend of $0.18 per share or $55 million. In December, we announced a 22% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.22, which was paid on January 12. In summary, we expect to increase capital deployment in 2021 as we fund additional share repurchases, the increased quarterly dividend, the Kantar Health acquisition and possibly other acquisitions or investments. We expect these actions to make better use of our balance sheet after getting to a low net leverage position in 2020 as we paused repurchases during the pandemic and received large cash inflows relating to divestitures and investment gains. 
Moving to guidance. As we previously discussed, while we have executed fairly well through the pandemic so far, a considerable amount of uncertainties still exist. So please note that our guidance remains subject to a higher than normal amount of risk. 
I'll start with revenue. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. As a reminder, Q1 of '20 included about $45 million of revenue from our commercial RevWorks and global divested businesses, which is not included in Q1 '21 revenue. The $1.395 billion midpoint of this range represents 2% growth from Q1 '20 after adjusting for these divestitures. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.75 billion and $5.95 billion. In addition to the $45 million of revenue impact from divestitures in Q1, the remaining headwind is approximately $40 million in Q2 [indiscernible] $4 million in [indiscernible] for a total of approximately $90 million. More than offsetting this impact for the year is an expected contribution from the Kantar Health acquisition, which we expect to contribute approximately $125 million in Q2 through Q4 based on anticipated closing in early Q2. 
The $5.85 billion midpoint of the 2021 guidance range represents 6% growth over 2020. Adjusting for both divestiture headwinds and the acquisition also results in 6% growth. 
Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of this range represents 4% growth over Q1 of '20. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.10 to $3.2 with a $3.15 midpoint, reflecting 11% growth over 2020. The moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.15 to $1.35 million. The midpoint of this range reflects 15% growth over the first quarter of 2020, which included some initial impact from the pandemic which took hold in the last part of the quarter. 
In summary, our 2021 outlook reflects a return to mid single-digit revenue growth with over 100 basis points of margin expansion, driving double-digit EPS growth. This guidance is consistent with the long-term framework we shared at our last Investor Day and referenced again when we previewed 2021 on our Q3 '20 call. We note that current adjusted EPS consensus is slightly above our guidance range. It's impacted by a couple of estimates that are not consistent with this frame. Adjusting for these estimates will result in consensus being in our guidance range. 
Note that we don't plan to do an Investor Day as we want Mark Erceg to have time to get up to speed. However, we have abided our long-term plan that is the source of our financial messaging at investor meetings, and the updated plan reflects similar revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth as the framework we shared last year. We also continue to expect our organic top line to be driven by our federal and strategic growth businesses and likely augmented by M&A. 
Mark will work with the team to determine the best timing for our next investor event but our strategy and long-term plan remain consistent with past communication, so we think it makes sense to hold off for now. In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the fourth quarter and full year as well as our positive outlook. 
Before turning the call over to Travis, want to say one more time, how much of an honor has been to be CFO at Cerner. Having spent time with Mark Hursit, a head of his upcoming start date, I'm confident he's going to step in and quickly add value to Cerner, our clients and shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Travis."

Today, I want to share my focus as I step into the role of Chief Client and Services Officer, and provide an update on our federal business. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't express my gratitude to John Peterzalek for his steadfast commitment to Cerner's mission and to Brent and our Board for the trust they have placed in me as I take on the role. So many of you know me as the leader of our federal business, and I've had the opportunity to speak with you many times in that capacity. I am entering my 20th year at Cerner and have had the privilege of working across every area of our client and services organization over that period of time. 
Moving forward, I have several guiding principles that will be used to drive our business decisions and lay the foundation for our success. First, we exist to serve our clients. Our clients remain at the center of everything that we do. We must earn the privilege to serve them every day. That means doing what we say we are going to do and providing end-to-end solutions that enable our clients to solve their most pressing challenges and achieve their missions. Second, we will play as one team with a focus on delivering value. We need to make it simple for our clients to do business with Cerner. This requires clarity of purpose, alignment of structure and focus on a common set of goals and objectives that are collectively focused on delivering value and improving client satisfaction. 
Third, we must produce the right business results. Results clearly matter, and we will ensure clear lines of accountability with data-driven transparency in pursuit of top and bottom line. We will hold ourselves and our teams accountable for those results. Finally, we'll play to win and strive for excellence. We have lost some key clients in recent years, and that's totally unacceptable. We will bring passion and energy to our work connect our product strategies to our client needs and embrace internal transformation as a mechanism to achieve excellence for our clients. We're going to aggressively defend our market presence, go on offense in pursuit of competition, and continue to innovate while pursuing opportunities to expand our footprint. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to step into this role, and I look forward to working with our clients around the world to positively impact health care. 
Turning to our federal business. Q4 wrapped up a historic year for the U.S. Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs and the United States Coast Guard. As Brent mentioned, for the first time ever, 3 federal agencies are now leveraging the same EHR and a new joint health information exchange. Despite facing the challenges of a global pandemic, we delivered on our promises and Cerner Solutions enabled our federal clients to more effectively manage through this crisis. Cerner's mass vaccination solution included in MHS Genesis deployment continues to be utilized across DoD and Coast Guard sites live with the system. As a core member of the Leidos partnership for Defense Health, Cerner continued our work with the DoD and Coast Guard, and we are now live at 20 DoD commands in 4 U.S. Coast Guard sites. 
As we move into '21, we expect to continue our momentum with multiple wave deployments and ongoing sustainment of live facilities. On October 24, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced the first successful go live for their new EHR at Man Grand Stack, VA Medical center in Spokane, Washington, and its 4 community-based outpatient clinics in Montana, Idaho and Washington. This go-live event include -- also included the West consolidated patient account center, a VA business operations facility in Las Vegas. We are pleased with this progress and continue to work with Man Grand staff on sustainment and system optimization. This work followed the successful implementation of our scheduling solution in Columbus, Ohio; and our Dod Va and Coast Guard Joint health Information Exchange go live via e-health exchange and Commonwell earlier in 2020. VA and Cerner are actively moving forward and preparing for multiple site deployments planned for 2021, including conducting current state reviews, site localization, testing, required interfaces and working with providers at those locations. Cerner, along with our partners, will continue to focus on providing a lifetime of seamless care for our nation's service members and veterans. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Don."

Providence Health in Seattle was ground 0 for COVID-19. The first patient that presented noted to a nurse practitioner that he had a cough, and she would learn through the documentation process that he recently returned from overseas travel. He was tested and a day later admitted. Provident CEO, Rod Hochman, tells the story of a whiteboard drawing. As the crisis grew, Hockman wrote 3 acronyms across the board before COVID, BC; during COVID, DC; and after COVID, AC. 
It was hackman effort to simplify the complex and more importantly, to drive strategies to manage it. And amid hundreds of different client conversations over the course of 2020, Ackman's framing stuck with me. Our push to integrate the health system enterprise, advance the health network and create a data-driven health economy began before COVID. We rallied as an organization to progress those strategies during Co vid and we see an unparalleled opportunity to lead in all 3 areas after coven. 
At the enterprise level, our focus is simple. Every client is working to increase the revenue of key service lines, lower unit costs and manage within a larger health network and the ZIP codes where they operate. Cerner Solutions must enable an integrated delivery system with 1 record, 1 plan and 1 bill. Over the course of 2020, several health system enterprise Solutions delivered during COVID impact. Our real-time health system business drove over $110 million in booked revenue representing over 85% growth year-over-year. Workforce and capacity management, hospital operations, provider communications, they've all been essential crisis response capabilities during COVID and will be pivotal to tackling total cost of care after it. 
In the revenue cycle space, we launched our engage and access offering in the first quarter. It provided clients the tools they need to drive access management as they responded to COBI disruptions and rethink how scheduling and registration should work in a digital-first enterprise. Finally, our consumer business sought to build a unified experience centered on the person. The business generated more than $175 million in bookings in 2020, growing at more than 150% year-over-year. 
Our clients need us to move even faster on our whole person solutions suite in 2021 and and David Bradshaw and his team are bringing strategic urgency to those efforts. The biggest trend in provider health care before, during and after COVID, centers on the push for vertical integration beyond the 4 walls of the hospital. This mix of owned and affiliated physician practices, post-acute care facilities and the home is venue, are critical nodes on the health networks being built out in every community. These health network strategies have diverse contractual Frameworks and Disparate technologies and our healthe intent platform is purpose-built to integrate and manage them. 
Amid the market disruption of COVID, our health network business delivered more than 20% bookings growth year-over-year. Kim Lovik and the team also added 23 new healthy intent footprints, almost 1/3 of which were outside of our Millennium base. As the health network team looks out after COVID, our strategic objectives are simple: One, we have to grow share of the health network wallet, adding lives and solutions to each client relationship. Two, we have to continue to expand into new geographies, both in the U.S. and in our 5. we have to win new buyers, including traditional payers, employers and governments. They are the 1, 2, 3 by 2023 work to be done to build a $1 billion health network business by 2025. 
Our multi-decade efforts at the health system enterprise and now at the health network level have created a set of strong only Cerner differentiators. Cerner has an industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize provider health care data, it is the structure store and study promise of the systems thinking that we've built at Cerner in the 1990s and the 2000s and still today. We also have a deep understanding of the last mile provider workflow. It's the close the loop connection that allows us to deliver the right information at the right time and the right place to drive the right outcome. 
Over the course of 2020, we launched a learning health network that attracted 55 client members, representing almost 100 million patients and more than 500 million encounters. We launched our Cove data cohort, attracting some of the most notable names in academic research and generating dozens of peer-reviewed studies. We advanced our strategic objective to build out a total solution offering for late-stage clinical trials. As Brent noted, we differentiated our strategies by winning new business with UBC, signing a new partnership and investment with Elligo Health Research and with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Kantar Health. 
Before COVID, real-world evidence was beginning to disrupt traditional clinical trials. During COVID, regulatory response to the pandemic has accelerated this shift and how therapeutic discoveries are advanced. And after Covid, Cerner's large provider client base, first and last mile data expertise, offer us an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine this market. 
For leaders on the front lines of the COVID crisis, I will tell you that the stories stick with you. Our clients tell us about the first cases at their health systems. To share with you stories about families being forced to check on relatives on face time because they couldn't be at the bedside. And they worry aloud about caregivers as hospitalization and case fatality rates become the tough daily work to be managed. And yet, for all of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, CEOs can't leave a team's call without seeing post pandemic possibilities.

Ii'll answer you. So Mark number two, that have a good book of jugs. Re so that Quest is probably for Don and Travis. When I think about where you guys are going, 1 hand you talked about customer lost business. My sense is that's very focused on a private company in the legacy traditional space. The pump side is icon new markets. And literally, I can't keep up with a number of new companies in this business is new model that are out there, and they're all innovative and do want to stuff. So as you sit in the middle of that, how do you balance and how do you see the challenge of one, trying to deal with legacy's competitor who's won a lot of share. You're trying to re case them. And also, as you grow in these new areas, how do you convince these people that were not just the old Cerner and why they shouldn't go with some new newer model. Just sorry, would love some perspective about yes."

I think the first thing I would say is great companies are all about the end. So what's the ability to both work on the business as it's defined today and simultaneously, identify new growth opportunities that are both adjacencies and as you said, new markets. So fundamentally, I would say that's the way in which we built the company, and that's the opportunity set in front of us in the 5 years ahead. The second thing I would say is, as I think about strategies around health network and I think about strategies around the data space, particularly what we're doing around life sciences and pharma they are highly aligned with the business strategies of our traditional clients. So we are always at our best when we're building technologies and advancing solution strategies that are aligned to with business objectives of our provider clients. And we think that the strategies that we're advancing absolutely do that. And then the final thing I would say is the execution need for us is to make sure that we are thinking through capital allocation strategies in a way that not only works for our provider clients, but also allows us to begin to think about new buyer types beyond our provider base, whether that's payer, an employer and government opportunities around network or that's life sciences and pharma around the data space. So I think that's what we're working on, and I think you articulated it well."

Our goal is to take them from where they are and take them along that continuum related to our vision and their needs. So we plan to be aggressive, and we plan to work across that entire continuum. And from my perspective, we're going to fight in the core, and we're going to work hard in the core to make sure that we keep our clients current that we meet their expectations that we do what we say. That gives us an opportunity to extend and expand in that existing client base. And from my view, that's really an opportunity for us to amplify the work that Don is describing related to strategic growth so that we can take those core clients along that journey over time. So it's crucial that we do the basics, the block and tackling of keeping commitments, meeting commitments, keeping clients current, doing what we're saying we're going to do so that we can extend and expand and move them forward. And then furthermore, I think it gives us opportunity to continue growth in federal and also potentially some targeted global opportunity and again, with force multiplier of the work we're doing in strategic growth. So I don't view them as separate things. I view it as 1 thing, treating our clients, right, listening, solving their problems and then taking them on that journey with us."

So first of all, I think we start by thinking about what's the strategic differentiators that we bring to the space. And so I think the clinical data asset that we have, including traceability around that data and its province is a critical differentiator for us when you think about clinical trial activity. The second thing is the ability to have a patient and provider access as part of how we actually think about tackling time and cost basis for clinical trial activity. So we start there with those differentiators. I think what Kantar gives us then is the ability to take a long-standing competency around data linking and data curation and to include some really significant a PhD MD and epidemiological capabilities to really make sure that we can fulfill the value proposition that life sciences and pharma companies are looking for, for late-stage trial activity. And then to your question around how we go to market, I think the activity to date has taken different forms. I think the lago investment in partnership is really around strategies associated with site activation for our provider clients who are participating or will participate in those clinical trials I think Kantar gives us both proprietary data assets and domain expertise, but also the ability to then begin start thinking about those call points within life sciences and pharma to actually originate those contractual opportunities and drive revenue. So yes, we've partnered with UBC and other CROs, and that's a dimensional aspect of, I think, how we validated our capabilities. But I think we're excited about what we can do with the business as constituted in 2021.

It gives us opportunity to extend those agreements, but it also gives us white space to expand with new solution capabilities. So it's very important that we focus there. The federal business, I had the pleasure of leading that business for the last 6 years. I think we have continued solid opportunity there. I think we have opportunity beyond our core contracts. I see potential for us with new agency work. I see potential with the work that we're doing in strategic growth to go do work with them on the network side. And so I do think federal continues to be an opportunity for us. And I think we'll become more and more efficient in that business as time goes by, particularly in how we deliver service, how we behave as a prime contractor and also probably the use of third-party resources. And then I've mentioned the amplification of strategic growth multiple times, but I think that as we develop those capabilities, we have the opportunity to take them into our client base and our markets in really an aggressive and strategic way. And I think that gives us opportunity to have the right line of business mix as well as we push forward. And then M&A is an enabling strategy. I don't know. For me, it has to support the core strategy, and we're doing that, and we're putting our capital to use. So I think those 4 or 5 key areas will be our focus for go to market.

The midpoint of our guidance achieved more than that 100 bps. And it's going to come from a variety of places. I think a key thing to remember for the people that might be looking for, why isn't there more margin expansion in this year? Going through 2020, we accelerated some of our savings opportunities and our cost optimization in order to deliver the results we were able to deliver on the earnings line for the year. So we pulled some things forward, which means we're still working. We still have additional opportunities. But those will kind of across expense lines, and some of them will hit in the gross margin line, too, from a cost perspective. So they'll be spread pretty much throughout.

Anything else that you have line of sight into that kind of helps explain the pickup in revenue growth off the 1Q levels?"

I mean, I don't have a set answer to give you other than -- it goes back to core principles as it relates to that market, I mean, it's listening to your clients and solving their problems every day, holding our folks accountable for results. It's really, I think, embracing our internal mission to transform some of the work that we're doing to better connect client needs to our product capabilities, I think, is absolutely critical for us as it relates to better service delivery to our core clients. And it's really -- it's absolutely focusing on what I call the say do ratio. If you say it, you got to do it. And so those are things that are really relevant to our core clients. We have to make sure that we uplift those clients and we have them current. Our current clients stay with us and so I think a real focus from us on that element is very important. It makes it easier for them to test to train. It makes it easier for us to use the data in a meaningful way. And so I think it's really back to executing in the right way on the basics and then covering them fully. Relationships matter. And we've got to cover those clients in a way that matters to them. And it's also important that they understand. And the point I was trying to make earlier, we're not abandoning the core. We're focused on that, while we continue to innovate, while we continue to develop capabilities and thought leadership. We're doing that on behalf of those core clients, and we want them to be on that journey with us. And so I think clean, crisp, clear messaging is really important for us as we -- as I call it, bring back the swagger with that group of clients, and they have to understand what we're doing and why and how we're bringing them along. And so I think those are really the basic principles. That we're going to try to bring forward."

If you just think about it simplistically, the core is absolutely foundational, as Travis just said, as we've all said today. There's a lot of opportunity in the core. And that comes through defending the core and expanding the core, and there is room to expand the core through white space that's available delivering solutions into that space. So shoring that up, executing very well in that area is key. Federal, of course, is absolutely critical. And glad to have things on track there and Travis' leadership in that area and now a leadership in that same drive going to our full commercial organization. And strategic growth, again, executing to executing our plans as laid out. And there is a loop back because the strategic growth has a strong correlation to how well we do in the core. And how solid we are in the core. So making sure we've made that connection, those relationships, that execution is very solid, is key. And then just as we've laid out, the transformation work is critical because having standard ways of operating and making us effective operating at the scale is critical in finding deficiencies in the business that allow us to continue to invest in innovation. Those are really the keys in the midterm. So the primary emphasis is execution."

Thanks for the question. Mark, congratulations on your transition. With respect to the comments on uplift clients and make them current, that's important to the core, can you guys just provide us maybe an updated time line on the transition of Millennium to the has anything changed there? When does it really begin? And when do you expect it completed? And any financial impact would be helpful. Yes. This is Mark. As we've kind of indicated, we quickly moved healthy intent to the cloud. And Careaware is primarily move there. We've indicated Millennium will be kind of a process. We probably will never move all of millennia. There are elements of Millennium that will stay stay out there. But the elements that face the client, the elements that need benefit from being updated very quickly and frequently, those are the elements that will move to the cloud. But that movement will kind of -- will occur over some period of time relative to our relative to the -- from a financial impact, there's -- it will vary a little bit. For the most part, a lot of our business today is designed to -- we have a hosting business already. We have elements of recurring revenue that are similar to SaaS in a way. Certainly, as we start evolving and moving millennium more to a cloud like, there'll be a point at which you switch over to some SaaS accounting, which could have an impact on some of the implementation services and the timing of recognizing some of that revenue. But a lot of it is is pretty consistent to what we have. The timing of it, as I said, for Millennium, it really is more of an evolution. There is more work to do there, more modernization of the platform. We're spending a lot of time on. A lot of our resources are going into that modernization. So I'm pretty confident that by the end of my tenure, it won't be done. But given that only about 30 days, that probably doesn't really count. But it is a process. And certainly, as that process continues, and we get a better view of milestones and waypoints, we'll be able to give you an update kind of on what the financial impact is. But once again, the business today operates a lot of the elements of it are recurring in nature. So those would be similar to what you see in a SaaS model to a great extent. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Sorry, I was just going to say, at some level, the part of the answer here, too, is a little bit of the answer to George's question, which is hey, if you create value for your clients, good things will happen. The cloud technologies hold a significant value proposition for our clients around product and platform modernization. So government is the largest payer. It creates opportunities for them to think about regulatory and currency faster. And it creates opportunities for them to adopt functionality quicker. It allows them to think about reduction in total cost of ownership or redirection of dollars to things that they think will innovate and grow their business. So you can see that with healthy intent that the value proposition is front and center career has been great for us because it's really allowed us to work through, not just the technical components, but to Marc's point, also some of the nontechnical contractual and inside the 4 walls topics that have to be surfaced. And we're already making progress on Millennium in terms of high-value workflows oriented around the cloud, and we'll continue to be selective about how we progress that approach. And I think it will play into a narrative around value proposition for our core clients and enable them of a bunch of our strategic growth efforts, inclusive of the work of Healtheintent."

I guess can you talk about the strategy to win new customers like employers and payers that are not really part of the typical or traditional Cerner ecosystem? Yes. It's a great question, Alan. I think we have the good fortune of having some existing client relationships there. As you know, we have a workforce health business today. Focused on self-insured employers, 40-plus clients in that space. And then around our wellness application suite and our well-being application suite we have some existing payer relationships roughly 10. And so those have been really good testing grounds for us to really ask the question, hey, what would it look like for us to use healthy intent and add leverage there. And fundamentally, what we see, Alan, is they're working on the same problem set in many ways that our Millennium and non Millennium provider clients are. They need a data foundation, they're thinking about network management, they're thinking about reporting dashboarding and analytic capabilities, care coordination, care management, all tethered to payment model and associated with member engagement. So we don't have turnkey MVP capabilities in those space, but we're building it out. And getting much closer to it. And we think through a combination of native build and again, through inorganic acquisition, we'll be able to drive meaningful top line and bottom line strategies around those buyer types in the next 5 years, certainly.

So -- and then when you think about that $150 million that you called out, that doesn't necessarily repeat in 2022 unless you have other stuff that comes up. Is that fair? Correct. The biggest -- it's a year-over-year impact. And obviously, the benefit we got in from the deferral doesn't repeat. You'll have the second half payment of that in '22. So you've got to have to pay back the $38 million or whatever. So I have a negative impact, but it would not be the $115 million or that larger number. So yes, much smaller impact.

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance.

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And then I'll hand it over to CFO, Marc Naughton; and our new Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton; and then our President, Don Trigg, for some more marketplace commentary.  
Well, 2020 was a remarkable year for all of us. And given the circumstances, Cerner delivered solid results by executing on our plans and really focusing on supporting our clients. The pandemic challenged Cerner and our clients on several fronts, and we continue to be extremely proud to support clients who are battling COVID on the front lines each and every day. And we're very pleased with the way our associates seamlessly transitioned to a remote work environment last March and have really remained productive and focused on our client success throughout this whole period.  
I'm also proud that Cerner recently began hosting a series of massive vaccination events at our world headquarters. This is done through a collaboration with North Kansas City Hospital, Liberty Hospital, Clay County Public Health Center in cities within Clay County. This initiative called Operation Safe is being staffed by volunteers from Cerner, North Kansas City Hospital and several partners in the community.  
And together, we've vaccinated nearly 5,000 people through 1 week, and we have additional events planned in the weeks ahead. And I've often said that Cerner's -- one of Cerner's strongest assets is how mission-driven our people are. And the willingness of our associates to rise to the challenge of this pandemic has really presented a strong demonstration of that commitment throughout the whole year.  
In addition to supporting our clients and communities, we continue to advance our growth strategies and make operational improvements as part of Cerner's ongoing transformation in 2020. As COVID accelerated health care macro trends, it also validated our growth initiatives, including the creation and expansion of health networks, our real-time health system capabilities in consumer-facing health strategies.  
Cerner is providing data-driven insights that can improve our clients' clinical, operational and financial outcomes. Our recent investment in Elligo Health Research in agreement to acquire Kantar Health are examples of how we're deploying capital to advance Cerner's growth strategies. And Don will provide more detail about these -- how these investments accelerate Cerner's presence in life sciences and create a strong foundation for our Data-as-a-Service business.  
We also continue toward our transformation goals. Cerner's transformation has been focused on simplifying the business, creating operational efficiencies and delivering profitable growth. And we're nearing $300 million in annualized cost reductions since beginning our transformation efforts about 2 years ago. And we believe those efficiencies and our resilient business model really helped mitigate the impacts of COVID on our business.  
As part of our portfolio management process, we simplified our product set to go from offering more than 25,000 features to really fewer than 400 products. And we also divested RevWorks outsourcing business in some noncore global assets. Importantly, our work to deliver seamless care for 18 million service members and veterans remains on track. And for the first time in history, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Coast Guard are using the same electronic health record. And the number of patients in our Joint Health Information Exchange grew from 700,000 to 4 million since April of last year.  
Finally, we supported the evolution and transformation of our business by adding proven leaders who are already bringing a new perspective. Our Chief Technology Officer, Jerome Labat, joined us in June, bringing more than 30 years of CTO and product development experience at Fortune 500 and leading global tech companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intuit and Oracle. 
In September, Chief Strategy Officer, Will Mintz, came to Cerner after working with leading health care and technology businesses, including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield. You probably know Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton, from his leadership in our federal business. And we're excited to have Travis now bringing that same leadership to our global client base, while retaining oversight of our critically important federal work. Mark Erceg is our most recent appointment and will replace long time Cerner CFO, Marc Naughton, on February 22. Mark is a high energy leader, who will bring more than 25 years of financial leadership experience, including driving transformation across complex global operations and leveraging balance sheets to drive growth and shareholder value.  
In addition to those leaders, we are also honored to have Major General Elder Granger join the Cerner Board of Directors in November. And Dr. Granger is a proven leader with experiences in clinical, military and business environments. 
And before I close, I'd like to acknowledge that this is our last earnings call with CFO, Marc Naughton, who, after nearly 30 years of service and 101 earnings calls, will be leaving Cerner at the end of the first quarter. And I know many of you share my appreciation for Marc and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. And Marc, I just have to say, I cannot imagine anything more fun than 101 earnings calls.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in 2020. We delivered toward our revised expectations while driving a significant amount of change in what we all have to say was a very unusual year in health care. It was very hard work. And I sincerely appreciate all Cerner associates in their contributions to this progress. And Marc, let me now turn it over to you for call number 101."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover Q4 results and future guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics in line with our expectations.  
I'll start with bookings, which were $1.68 billion, over $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Full year bookings were $5.585 billion, which is down from $5.99 billion in 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of pandemic and divestitures of our commercial RevWorks and certain global businesses in Q3. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $13.04 billion, which is down 5% from a year ago, due primarily to the impact of divestitures.  
Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from the ASC 606 backlog definition, still provides visibility to more than 85% of expected revenue over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter of $1.395 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range and represents roughly 1% year-over-year growth after adjusting for divestitures. Total revenue for the year was $5.506 billion, which also reflects approximately 1% growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures.  
I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '19 and full year 2019. Licensed software revenue in Q4 was flat year-over-year at $174 million. Full year licensed software revenue declined 4% from 2019 to $656 million due to pandemic-driven declines in traditional software, partially offset by growth in software and service revenue, which now makes up approximately 60% of total software revenue. 
To date, this shift has been driven primarily by growth in SaaS revenue related to healthy intent-based solutions. Going forward, we expect this shift to continue for additional factors and -- for additional factors to contribute, including changes this year in how we deliver in contracts for CareAware and CommunityWorks. Given the relatively small sizes of these businesses, the impact of the changes will not be significant. But we expect to use this transition as a guide for a broader move to SaaS with Millennium, which will occur as we continue to advance our platform and modernization.  
Technology resale in Q4 was down 8% year-over-year to $56 million and in line with our expectations. Full year technology resale revenue was down 20% to $197 million, primarily due to a tough overall environment for technology resale and the impact of the pandemic. Subscriptions revenue grew 6% in Q4 to $98 million and grew 5% for the full year to $378 million. Professional services revenue was down 6% in Q4 to $478 million and was down 3% for the full year to $1.93 billion, due primarily to the impact of the pandemic, divestitures, the termination of our large rentals agreement in 2019 and lower third-party services. 
Declines driven by these factors were partially offset by continued strength in federal professional services. Managed services was up 2% in Q4 to $317 million and up 3% for the full year to $1.245 billion. Support and maintenance of $263 million was down 4% in Q4 and down 3% for the full year to $1.071 billion due to the impact of divestitures, attrition and reduced hardware and maintenance revenue. And finally, reimbursed travel of $8 million was down 63% in Q4, down 71% for the full year at $28 million due pandemic-driven travel restrictions.  
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was down 3% from the year ago quarter at $1.23 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was also down 3% from the year ago quarter, due -- primarily due to the divestiture of assets in Germany and Spain. For the full year, domestic revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue declined 4% due to the impact of the pandemic as well as divestitures.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was up 240 basis points from a year ago to 83.2%, and full year was up 190 basis points over 2019 to 83.1, reflecting improved revenue mix due to less outsourcing, third-party services, technology resale and reimbursed travel.  
Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP, adjusted and non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19-related expense and allowance on a noncurrent asset, gains on the sale of businesses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.  
Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $987 million were basically flat compared to $982 million in the year ago quarter. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $2.879 billion, down 4% from $4.021 billion in 2019. Our adjusted operating expenses of $860 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared to Q4 of '19. And full year 2020 decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued cost optimization efforts, divestitures and lower travel expense. 
Looking at the line items for Q4, sales and client service expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by lower non-personnel expense and divestitures. Software development expense increased 4% from Q4 of '19, with gross R&D up 6% and a slight increase in net capitalized software. G&A expense in Q4 was down 9%, driven by a decline in both personnel and nonpersonnel expenses.  
Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7%, flat to the year ago period. Our GAAP operating margin for full year 2020 was 16.6% compared to 10.6% in 2019. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up from 20.3% in Q4 of '19 and 20.4% last quarter, reflecting the impact of our cost optimization efforts and improved revenue mix.  
Our full year adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, representing 140 basis points full year margin expansion over 2019. We're happy with our operating margins in 2020 given the circumstances and expect to continue improving margins as we deliver ongoing optimization efforts and aim to realize a longer-term benefit from platform modernization.  
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $142 million or $0.46 per diluted share, down from $0.49 in Q4 of '19. The full year GAAP net earnings were $780 million or $2.52 per diluted share and includes gains from divestitures and investment sales. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $241 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, up 4% compared to 75% -- $0.75 in Q4 of '19.  
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $879 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.84, up 6% in 2019 Our GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and 20% for the full year. For 2021, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the 21% to 22% range.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.06 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.34 billion of debt. Our receivables ended the year at $1.17 billion, down $50 million from last quarter. Our Q4 DSO was 76 days, which is down from 81 days in Q3 '20 and up from 72 days in the year ago period. Looking forward, we expect DSO to remain in the 70s.  
Operating cash flow in Q4 was very strong at $513 million. Capital expenditures were $46 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow was a record high of $396 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.437 billion. Capital expenditures were $284 million and capitalized software was $295 million. Full year free cash flow was $857 million, which is up $290 million from 2019, driven by solid operating cash flow and nearly $200 million reduction in capital expenditures.  
For 2021, we expect an increase in free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow growth, continued CapEx control. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the CARES Act payroll tax deferral ending and an increase -- an expected increase in capitalized software related to some focused use of third-party developers to assist with platform modernization work. In total, these 2 items are expected to impact free cash flow by about $150 million, with over 3/4 being tied to payroll taxes.  
Moving to capital allocation. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Kantar Health for $375 million in cash, subject to adjustment. As Don will discuss, this acquisition is a strong complement to our existing Data-as-a-Service efforts and represents a meaningful entry to the pharmaceutical market. We expect the transition to close in the second quarter.  
We also resumed our share repurchase program in Q4 and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million. This brings our total for the year to 10.6 million shares repurchased or $757 million, an average price of $71.07 per share and leaves us with $927 million remaining on our current authorization. Subject to Board approval, we currently expect to repurchase up to $1 billion-plus this year, with the exact amount depending on the amount of cash used for other purposes such as acquisitions beyond the previously discussed Kantar Health deal.  
Moving to our dividend program. In October, we paid a dividend of $0.18 per share or $55 million. In December, we announced a 22% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.22, which was paid on January 12. In summary, we expect to increase capital deployment in 2021 as we fund additional share repurchases, the increased quarterly dividend, the Kantar Health acquisition and possibly other acquisitions or investments. We expect these actions to make better use of our balance sheet after getting to low net leverage position in 2020 as we paused repurchases during the pandemic and received large cash inflows relating to divestitures and investment gains.  
Moving to guidance. As we previously discussed, while we have executed fairly well through the pandemic so far, a considerable amount of uncertainty still exist. So please note that our guidance remains subject to a higher than normal amount of risk.  
I'll start with revenue. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. As a reminder, Q1 of '20 included about $45 million of revenue from our commercial RevWorks and global divested businesses, which is not included in Q1 '21 revenue. The $1.395 billion midpoint of this range represents 2% growth from Q1 '20 after adjusting for these divestitures. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.75 billion and $5.95 billion. In addition to the $45 million of revenue impact from divestitures in Q1, the remaining headwind is approximately $40 million in Q2 -- about $4 million in Q2 for a total of approximately $90 million. More than offsetting this impact for the year is an expected contribution from the Kantar Health acquisition, which we expect to contribute approximately $125 million in Q2 through Q4 based on anticipated closing in early Q2. The $5.85 billion midpoint of the 2021 guidance range represents 6% growth over 2020. Adjusting for both divestiture headwinds and the acquisition also results in 6% growth.  
Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of this range represents 4% growth over Q1 of '20. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.10 to $3.2 with a $3.15 midpoint, reflecting 11% growth over 2020. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.15 to $1.35 million. The midpoint of this range reflects 15% growth over the first quarter of 2020, which included some initial impact from the pandemic which took hold in the last part of the quarter.  
In summary, our 2021 outlook reflects a return to mid single-digit revenue growth with over 100 basis points of margin expansion driving double-digit EPS growth. This guidance is consistent with the long-term framework we shared at our last Investor Day and referenced again when we previewed 2021 on our Q3 '20 call. We note that current adjusted EPS consensus is slightly above our guidance range. It's impacted by a couple of estimates that are not consistent with this framework. Adjusting for these estimates will result in consensus being in our guidance range.  
Note that we don't plan to do an Investor Day as we want Mark Erceg to have time to get up to speed. However, we have updated our long-term plan that is the source of our financial messaging at investor meetings, and the updated plan reflects similar revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth as the framework we shared last year. We also continue to expect our organic top line to be driven by our federal and strategic growth businesses and likely augmented by M&A.
mark will work with the team to determine the best timing for our next investor event, but our strategy and long-term plan remain consistent with past communication, so we think it makes sense to hold off for now. In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the fourth quarter and full year as well as our positive outlook.  
Before turning the call over to Travis, want to say 1 more time how much of an honor has been to be CFO at Cerner. Having spent time with Mark Erceg ahead of his upcoming start date, I'm confident he's going to step in and quickly add value to Cerner, our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Travis."

Today, I want to share my focus as I step into the role of Chief Client and Services Officer, and provide an update on our federal business. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't express my gratitude to John Peterzalek for his steadfast commitment to Cerner's mission and to Brent and our Board for the trust they have placed in me as I take on the role. So many of you know me as the leader of our federal business, and I've had the opportunity to speak with you many times in that capacity. I am entering my 20th year at Cerner and have had the privilege of working across every area of our client and services organization over that period of time. 
Moving forward, I have several guiding principles that will be used to drive our business decisions and lay the foundation for our success. First, we exist to serve our clients. Our clients remain at the center of everything that we do. We must earn the privilege to serve them every day. That means doing what we say we are going to do and providing end-to-end solutions that enable our clients to solve their most pressing challenges and achieve their missions. 
Second, we will play as one team with a focus on delivering value. We need to make it simple for our clients to do business with Cerner. This requires clarity of purpose, alignment of structure and focus on a common set of goals and objectives that are collectively focused on delivering value and improving client satisfaction. 
Third, we must produce the right business results. Results clearly matter, and we will ensure clear lines of accountability with data-driven transparency in pursuit of top and bottom line. We will hold ourselves and our teams accountable for those results. Finally, we'll play to win and strive for excellence. We have lost some key clients in recent years, and that's totally unacceptable. We will bring passion and energy to our work, connect our product strategies to our client needs and embrace internal transformation as a mechanism to achieve excellence for our clients. We're going to aggressively defend our market presence, go on offense in pursuit of competition, and continue to innovate while pursuing opportunities to expand our footprints. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to step into this role, and I look forward to working with our clients around the world to positively impact health care. 
Turning to our federal business. Q4 wrapped up a historic year for the U.S. Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs and the United States Coast Guard. As Brent mentioned, for the first time ever, 3 federal agencies are now leveraging the same EHR and a new Joint Health Information Exchange. Despite facing the challenges of a global pandemic, we delivered on our promises and Cerner Solutions enabled our federal clients to more effectively manage through this crisis. Cerner's mass vaccination solution included in MHS Genesis deployment continues to be utilized across DoD and Coast Guard sites live with the system. As a core member of the Leidos partnership for Defense Health, Cerner continued our work with the DoD and Coast Guard, and we are now live at 20 DoD commands in 4 U.S. Coast Guard sites. 
As we move into '21, we expect to continue our momentum with multiple wave deployments and ongoing sustainment of live facilities. On October 24, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced the first successful go live for their new EHR at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, and its 4 community-based outpatient clinics in Montana, Idaho and Washington. This go-live event include -- also included the West consolidated patient account center, a VA business operations facility in Las Vegas. We are pleased with this progress and continue to work with Mann-Grandstaff on sustainment and system optimization. This work followed the successful implementation of our scheduling solution in Columbus, Ohio; and our Dod, VA and Coast Guard Joint Health Information Exchange go live via eHealth Exchange and CommonWell earlier in 2020. 
VA and Cerner are actively moving forward and preparing for multiple site deployments planned for 2021, including conducting current state reviews, site localization, testing, required interfaces and working with providers at those locations. Cerner, along with our partners, will continue to focus on providing a lifetime of seamless care for our nation's service members and veterans. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Don."
259627,700829337,2203683,"Cerner Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Travis. Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19. The first patient that presented noted to a nurse practitioner that he had a cough, and she would learn through the documentation process that he recently returned from overseas tr",1024,"Thanks, Travis. Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19. The first patient that presented noted to a nurse practitioner that he had a cough, and she would learn through the documentation process that he recently returned from overseas travel. He was tested and a day later admitted. Providence CEO, Rod Hochman, tells the story of a whiteboard drawing. As the crisis grew, Hochman wrote 3 acronyms across the board: Before COVID, BC; during COVID, DC; and after COVID, AC. 
It was Hochman's effort to simplify the complex and more importantly, to drive strategies to manage it. And amid hundreds of different client conversations over the course of 2020, Hochman's framing stuck with me. Our push to integrate the health system enterprise, advance the health network and create a data-driven health economy began before COVID. We rallied as an organization to progress those strategies during COVID and we see an unparalleled opportunity to lead in all 3 areas after COVID. 
At the enterprise level, our focus is simple. Every client is working to increase the revenue of key service lines, lower unit costs and manage within a larger health network and the ZIP codes where they operate. Cerner Solutions must enable an integrated delivery system with 1 record, 1 plan and 1 bill. 
Over the course of 2020, several health system enterprise solutions delivered during COVID impact. Our real-time health system business drove over $110 million in booked revenue, representing over 85% growth year-over-year. Workforce and capacity management, hospital operations, provider communications, they've all been essential crisis response capabilities during COVID and will be pivotal to tackling total cost of care after it. 
In the revenue cycle space, we launched our engage and access offering in the first quarter. It provided clients the tools they need to drive access management as they responded to COVID disruptions and rethink how scheduling and registration should work in a digital-first enterprise. 
Finally, our consumer business sought to build a unified experience centered on the person. The business generated more than $175 million in bookings in 2020, growing at more than 150% year-over-year. 
Our clients need us to move even faster on our whole person solution suite in 2021, and  David Bradshaw and his team are bringing strategic urgency to those efforts. The biggest trend in provider health care before, during and after COVID centers on the push for vertical integration beyond the 4 walls of a hospital. This mix of owned and affiliated physician practices, post-acute care facilities and the home as venue are critical nodes on the health networks being built out in every community. These health network strategies have diverse contractual frameworks and disparate technologies and our HealtheIntent platform is purpose-built to integrate and manage them. 
Amid the market disruption of COVID, our health network business delivered more than 20% bookings growth year-over-year. [ Kim Lovik ] and the team also added 23 new HealtheIntent footprints, almost 1/3 of which were outside of our Millennium base. As the health network team looks out after COVID, our strategic objectives are simple: One, we have to grow share of the health network wallet, adding lives and solutions to each client relationship; two, we have to continue to expand into new geographies, both in the U.S. and in our 5 global focus regions; three, we have to win new buyers, including traditional payers, employers and governments. They are the 1, 2, 3 by 2023 work to be done to build a $1 billion health network business by 2025. 
Our multi-decade efforts at the health system enterprise and now at the health network level have created a set of strong only Cerner differentiators. Cerner has an industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize provider health care data, it is the structure store and study promise of the systems thinking that we've built at Cerner in the 1990s and the 2000s and still today. We also have a deep understanding of the last mile provider workflow. It's the closed loop connection that allows us to deliver the right information at the right time and the right place to drive the right outcome. 
Over the course of 2020, we launched a learning health network that attracted 55 client members, representing almost 100 million patients and more than 500 million encounters. We launched our COVID data cohort, attracting some of the most notable names in academic research and generating dozens of peer-reviewed studies. We advanced our strategic objective to build out a total solution offering for late-stage clinical trials. As Brent noted, we differentiated our strategies by winning new business with UBC, signing a new partnership and investment with Elligo Health Research and with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Kantar Health. 
Before COVID, real-world evidence was beginning to disrupt traditional clinical trials. During COVID, regulatory response to the pandemic has accelerated this shift and how therapeutic discoveries are advanced. And after COVID, Cerner's large provider client base, first and last mile data expertise, offer us an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine this market. 
For leaders on the front lines of the COVID crisis, I will tell you that the stories stick with you. Our clients tell us about the first cases at their health systems. They share with you stories about families being forced to check on relatives on FaceTime because they couldn't be at the bedside. And they worry aloud about caregivers as hospitalization and case fatality rates become the tough daily work to be managed. And yet, for all of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, CEOs can't leave a team's call without seeing post-pandemic possibilities. They all have some version of before COVID, during COVID and after COVID in their head. 
Our broad market opportunity is the same one that we're advancing today at Providence around areas like Xealth, new digital therapies and applications, as well as the deployment of our new well-being platform as COVID redefines employee health. Amid all of that, we are pleased with the 2020 progress that was made and excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And literally, I can't keep up with a number of new companies, new businesses, new models that are out there, and they're all innovative and do modest stuff.

You're trying to regain them, but then also, as you go in these new areas, how do you convince those people that we're not just the old Cerner and why they shouldn't go with some newer model.

So what's the ability to both work on the business as it's defined today and simultaneously, identify new growth opportunities that are both adjacencies and as you said, new markets. So fundamentally, I would say that's the way in which we built the company, and that's the opportunity set in front of us in the 5 years ahead. 
The second thing I would say is, as I think about strategies around health network and I think about strategies around the data space, particularly what we're doing around life sciences and pharma, they are highly aligned with the business strategies of our traditional clients. So we are always at our best when we're building technologies and advancing solution strategies that are aligned to with business objectives of our provider clients. And we think that the strategies that we're advancing absolutely do that. And then the final thing I would say is the execution need for us is to make sure that we are thinking through capital allocation strategies in a way that not only works for our provider clients, but also allows us to begin to think about new buyer types beyond our provider base, whether that's payer, an employer and government opportunities around network or that's life sciences and pharma around the data space. So I think that's what we're working on, and I think you articulated it well."

Our goal is to take them from where they are and take them along that continuum related to our vision and their needs. So we plan to be aggressive, and we plan to work across that entire continuum. And from my perspective, we're going to fight in the core, and we're going to work hard in the core to make sure that we keep our clients current, that we meet their expectations, that we do what we say. That gives us an opportunity to extend and expand in that existing client base. And from my view, that's really an opportunity for us and to amplify the work that Don is describing related to strategic growth so that we can take those core clients along that journey over time. 
So it's crucial that we do the basics, the block and tackling of keeping commitments, meeting commitments, keeping clients current, doing what we're saying we're going to do so that we can extend and expand and move them forward. And then furthermore, I think it gives us opportunity to continue growth in federal and also potentially some targeted global opportunity and again, with force multiplier of the work we're doing in strategic growth. So I don't view them as separate things. I view it as 1 thing, treating our clients, right, listening, solving their problems and then taking them on that journey with us."

So first of all, I think we start by thinking about what's the strategic differentiators that we bring to the space. And so I think the clinical data asset that we have, including traceability around that data and its province is a critical differentiator for us when you think about clinical trial activity. 
The second thing is the ability to have a patient and provider access as part of how we actually think about tackling, time and cost basis for clinical trial activity. So we start there with those differentiators. I think what Kantar gives us then is the ability to take a long-standing competency around data linking and data curation and to include some really significant a PhD MD and epidemiological capabilities to really make sure that we can fulfill the value proposition that life sciences and pharma companies are looking for, for late-stage trial activity. 
And then to your question around how we go to market, I think the activity to date has taken different forms. I think the Elligo investment in partnership is really around strategies associated with site activation for our provider clients who are participating or will participate in those clinical trials. I think Kantar gives us both proprietary data assets and domain expertise, but also the ability to then begin to start thinking about those call points within life sciences and pharma to actually originate those contractual opportunities and drive revenue. 
So yes, we've partnered with UBC and other CROs, and that's a dimensional aspect of, I think, how we validated our capabilities. But I think we're excited about what we can do with the business as constituted in 2021. And  I think to Marc's point, look at other opportunities for inorganic acquisition and further growth in this space as we play forward our strategy."

So we're going to have a reinvigorated strategy around them. And it's going to be on Travis' watch.

I mean 1 is we've talked about it, but our core clients are important, I mean, the heart and soul of Cerner in a lot of ways, they've been with us a long time. It's really important for us because we do well when our clients are current, and we're investing and we're working with them to keep them current. It gives us opportunity to extend those agreements, but it also gives us white space to expand with new solution capabilities. So it's very important that we focus there. 
The federal business, I've had the pleasure of leading that business for the last 6 years. I think we have continued solid opportunity there. I think we have opportunity beyond our core contracts. I see potential for us with new agency work. I see potential with the work that we're doing in strategic growth to go do work with them on the network side. And so I do think federal continues to be an opportunity for us. And I think we'll become more and more efficient in that business as time goes by, particularly in how we deliver service, how we behave as a prime contractor and also probably the use of third-party resources. 
And then I've mentioned the amplification of strategic growth multiple times, but I think that as we develop those capabilities, we have the opportunity to take them into our client base and our markets in really an aggressive and strategic way. And I think that gives us opportunity to have the right line of business mix as well as we push forward. And then M&A is an enabling strategy. I don't know. For me, it has to support the core strategy, and we're doing that, and we're putting our capital to use. So I think those 4 or 5 key areas will be our focus for go to market, and then ensuring that we deliver on an end-to-end service basis in the most efficient way possible, also have a pretty extensive delivery background on the services side, so we'll be focused on proper delivery."

Certainly, our activity on the M&A side could impact that somewhat, and we're going to apply our capital in the best way possible. But I think from a margin expansion view, certainly, our long-term view that we shared that remains in place is 100-plus bps of increase in margins every year. The midpoint of our guidance achieved more than that 100 bps. And it's going to come from a variety of places. 
I think a key thing to remember for the people that might be looking for why isn't there more margin expansion in this year? Going through 2020, we accelerated some of our savings opportunities and our cost optimization in order to deliver the results we were able to deliver on the earnings line for the year. So we pulled some things forward, which means we're still working, we still have additional opportunities. 
But those were kind of across expense lines, and some of them will hit in the gross margin line, too, from a cost perspective. So they'll be spread pretty much throughout. There isn't any 1 thing we're relying on particularly to drive it. Almost all of it is already in process. And is just really going and realizing the benefit that we began the process of driving in 2020."

And it's really -- it's absolutely focusing on what I call the say-do ratio. If you say it, you got to do it. 
And so those are things that are really relevant to our core clients. We have to make sure that we uplift those clients and we have them current. Our current clients stay with us, and so I think a real focus from us on that element is very important. It makes it easier for them to test to train. It makes it easier for us to use the data in a meaningful way. And so I think it's really back to executing in the right way on the basics and then covering them fully. Relationships matter. And we've got to cover those clients in a way that matters to them. And it's also important that they understand. 
And the point I was trying to make earlier, we're not abandoning the core. We're focused on that, while we continue to innovate, while we continue to develop capabilities and thought leadership, we're doing that on behalf of those core clients, and we want them to be on that journey with us. And so I think clean, crisp, clear messaging is really important for us as we -- as I call it, bring back the swagger with that group of clients, and they have to understand what we're doing and why and how we're bringing them along. And so I think those are really the basic principles that we're going to try to bring forward."

Maybe just with the eye to the midterm, my thoughts would be similar that if you just think about it simplistically, the core is absolutely foundational, as Travis just said, as we've all said today. There's a lot of opportunity in the core. And that comes through defending the core and expanding the core, and there is room to expand the core through white space that's available, delivering solutions into that space. So shoring that up, executing very well in that area is key. 
Federal, of course, is absolutely critical. And glad to have things on track there and Travis' leadership in that area and now a leadership in that same drive going to our full commercial organization. And strategic growth, again, executing our plans as laid out. And there is a loop back because the strategic growth has a strong correlation to how well we do in the core and how solid we are in the core. So making sure we've made that connection, those relationships, that execution is very solid, is key. 
And then just as we've laid out, the transformation work is critical because having standard ways of operating and making us effective operating at the scale is critical in finding deficiencies in the business that allow us to continue to invest in innovation. Those are really the keys in the midterm. So the primary emphasis is execution."

But that movement will kind of -- will occur over some period of time relative to our -- relative to the -- from a financial impact, there's -- it will vary a little bit. 
But for the most part, a lot of our business today is designed to -- we have a hosting business already. We have elements of recurring revenue that are similar to SaaS in a way. Certainly, as we start evolving and moving millennium more to a cloud, like there'll be a point at which you switch over to some SaaS accounting, which could have an impact on some of the implementation services and the timing of recognizing some of that revenue. But a lot of it is pretty consistent to what we have. 
The timing of it, as I said, for Millennium, it really is more of an evolution. There is more work to do there, more modernization of the platform. We're spending a lot of time on. And a lot of our resources are going into that modernization. So I'm pretty confident that by the end of my tenure, it will all be done. But given that's only about 30 days, that probably doesn't really count. But it is a process. 
And certainly, as that process continues, and we get a better view of milestones and waypoints, we'll be able to give you an update kind of on what the financial impact is. But once again, the business today operates, a lot of the elements of it are recurring in nature. So those would be similar to what you see in a SaaS model to a great extent."

The cloud technologies hold a significant value proposition for our clients around product and platform modernization. So government is the largest payer. It creates opportunities for them to think about regulatory and currency faster. And it creates opportunities for them to adopt functionality quicker. It allows them to think about reduction in total cost of ownership or redirection of dollars to things that they think will innovate and grow their business. 
So you can see that with HealtheIntent that the value proposition is front and center. CareAware has been great for us because it's really allowed us to work through, not just the technical components, but to Marc's point, also some of the nontechnical contractual and inside the 4 walls topics that have to be surfaced. And we're already making progress on Millennium in terms of high-value workflows oriented around the cloud, and we'll continue to be selective about how we progress that approach. And I think it will play into a narrative around value proposition for our core clients and enablement of a bunch of our strategic growth efforts, inclusive of the work of HealtheIntent."

And fundamentally, what we see, Alan, is they're working on the same problem set in many ways that our Millennium and non-Millennium provider clients are. They need a data foundation, they're thinking about network management, they're thinking about reporting, dashboarding and analytic capabilities, care coordination, care management, all tethered to payment model and associated with member engagement.

So that's a little bit of what the mix of the business looks like.

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance.

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And then I'll hand it over to CFO, Marc Naughton; and our new Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton; and then our President, Don Trigg, for some more marketplace commentary.  
Well, 2020 was a remarkable year for all of us. And given the circumstances, Cerner delivered solid results by executing on our plans and really focusing on supporting our clients. The pandemic challenged Cerner and our clients on several fronts, and we continue to be extremely proud to support clients who are battling COVID on the front lines each and every day. And we're very pleased with the way our associates seamlessly transitioned to a remote work environment last March and have really remained productive and focused on our client success throughout this whole period.  
I'm also proud that Cerner recently began hosting a series of massive vaccination events at our world headquarters. This is done through a collaboration with North Kansas City Hospital, Liberty Hospital, Clay County Public Health Center in cities within Clay County. This initiative called Operation Safe is being staffed by volunteers from Cerner, North Kansas City Hospital and several partners in the community.  
And together, we've vaccinated nearly 5,000 people through 1 week, and we have additional events planned in the weeks ahead. And I've often said that Cerner's -- one of Cerner's strongest assets is how mission-driven our people are. And the willingness of our associates to rise to the challenge of this pandemic has really presented a strong demonstration of that commitment throughout the whole year.  
In addition to supporting our clients and communities, we continue to advance our growth strategies and make operational improvements as part of Cerner's ongoing transformation in 2020. As COVID accelerated health care macro trends, it also validated our growth initiatives, including the creation and expansion of health networks, our real-time health system capabilities in consumer-facing health strategies.  
Cerner is providing data-driven insights that can improve our clients' clinical, operational and financial outcomes. Our recent investment in Elligo Health Research in agreement to acquire Kantar Health are examples of how we're deploying capital to advance Cerner's growth strategies. And Don will provide more detail about these -- how these investments accelerate Cerner's presence in life sciences and create a strong foundation for our Data-as-a-Service business.  
We also continue toward our transformation goals. Cerner's transformation has been focused on simplifying the business, creating operational efficiencies and delivering profitable growth. And we're nearing $300 million in annualized cost reductions since beginning our transformation efforts about 2 years ago. And we believe those efficiencies and our resilient business model really helped mitigate the impacts of COVID on our business.  
As part of our portfolio management process, we simplified our product set to go from offering more than 25,000 features to really fewer than 400 products. And we also divested RevWorks outsourcing business in some noncore global assets. Importantly, our work to deliver seamless care for 18 million service members and veterans remains on track. And for the first time in history, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Coast Guard are using the same electronic health record. And the number of patients in our Joint Health Information Exchange grew from 700,000 to 4 million since April of last year.  
Finally, we supported the evolution and transformation of our business by adding proven leaders who are already bringing a new perspective. Our Chief Technology Officer, Jerome Labat, joined us in June, bringing more than 30 years of CTO and product development experience at Fortune 500 and leading global tech companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intuit and Oracle. 
In September, Chief Strategy Officer, Will Mintz, came to Cerner after working with leading health care and technology businesses, including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield. You probably know Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton, from his leadership in our federal business. And we're excited to have Travis now bringing that same leadership to our global client base, while retaining oversight of our critically important federal work. Mark Erceg is our most recent appointment and will replace long time Cerner CFO, Marc Naughton, on February 22. Mark is a high energy leader, who will bring more than 25 years of financial leadership experience, including driving transformation across complex global operations and leveraging balance sheets to drive growth and shareholder value.  
In addition to those leaders, we are also honored to have Major General Elder Granger join the Cerner Board of Directors in November. And Dr. Granger is a proven leader with experiences in clinical, military and business environments. 
And before I close, I'd like to acknowledge that this is our last earnings call with CFO, Marc Naughton, who, after nearly 30 years of service and 101 earnings calls, will be leaving Cerner at the end of the first quarter. And I know many of you share my appreciation for Marc and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. And Marc, I just have to say, I cannot imagine anything more fun than 101 earnings calls.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in 2020. We delivered toward our revised expectations while driving a significant amount of change in what we all have to say was a very unusual year in health care. It was very hard work. And I sincerely appreciate all Cerner associates in their contributions to this progress. And Marc, let me now turn it over to you for call number 101."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover Q4 results and future guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics in line with our expectations.  
I'll start with bookings, which were $1.68 billion, over $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Full year bookings were $5.585 billion, which is down from $5.99 billion in 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of pandemic and divestitures of our commercial RevWorks and certain global businesses in Q3. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $13.04 billion, which is down 5% from a year ago, due primarily to the impact of divestitures.  
Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from the ASC 606 backlog definition, still provides visibility to more than 85% of expected revenue over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter of $1.395 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range and represents roughly 1% year-over-year growth after adjusting for divestitures. Total revenue for the year was $5.506 billion, which also reflects approximately 1% growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures.  
I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '19 and full year 2019. Licensed software revenue in Q4 was flat year-over-year at $174 million. Full year licensed software revenue declined 4% from 2019 to $656 million due to pandemic-driven declines in traditional software, partially offset by growth in software and service revenue, which now makes up approximately 60% of total software revenue. 
To date, this shift has been driven primarily by growth in SaaS revenue related to healthy intent-based solutions. Going forward, we expect this shift to continue for additional factors and -- for additional factors to contribute, including changes this year in how we deliver in contracts for CareAware and CommunityWorks. Given the relatively small sizes of these businesses, the impact of the changes will not be significant. But we expect to use this transition as a guide for a broader move to SaaS with Millennium, which will occur as we continue to advance our platform and modernization.  
Technology resale in Q4 was down 8% year-over-year to $56 million and in line with our expectations. Full year technology resale revenue was down 20% to $197 million, primarily due to a tough overall environment for technology resale and the impact of the pandemic. Subscriptions revenue grew 6% in Q4 to $98 million and grew 5% for the full year to $378 million. Professional services revenue was down 6% in Q4 to $478 million and was down 3% for the full year to $1.93 billion, due primarily to the impact of the pandemic, divestitures, the termination of our large rentals agreement in 2019 and lower third-party services. 
Declines driven by these factors were partially offset by continued strength in federal professional services. Managed services was up 2% in Q4 to $317 million and up 3% for the full year to $1.245 billion. Support and maintenance of $263 million was down 4% in Q4 and down 3% for the full year to $1.071 billion due to the impact of divestitures, attrition and reduced hardware and maintenance revenue. And finally, reimbursed travel of $8 million was down 63% in Q4, down 71% for the full year at $28 million due pandemic-driven travel restrictions.  
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was down 3% from the year ago quarter at $1.23 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was also down 3% from the year ago quarter, due -- primarily due to the divestiture of assets in Germany and Spain. For the full year, domestic revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue declined 4% due to the impact of the pandemic as well as divestitures.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was up 240 basis points from a year ago to 83.2%, and full year was up 190 basis points over 2019 to 83.1, reflecting improved revenue mix due to less outsourcing, third-party services, technology resale and reimbursed travel.  
Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP, adjusted and non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19-related expense and allowance on a noncurrent asset, gains on the sale of businesses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.  
Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $987 million were basically flat compared to $982 million in the year ago quarter. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $2.879 billion, down 4% from $4.021 billion in 2019. Our adjusted operating expenses of $860 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared to Q4 of '19. And full year 2020 decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued cost optimization efforts, divestitures and lower travel expense. 
Looking at the line items for Q4, sales and client service expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by lower non-personnel expense and divestitures. Software development expense increased 4% from Q4 of '19, with gross R&D up 6% and a slight increase in net capitalized software. G&A expense in Q4 was down 9%, driven by a decline in both personnel and nonpersonnel expenses.  
Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7%, flat to the year ago period. Our GAAP operating margin for full year 2020 was 16.6% compared to 10.6% in 2019. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up from 20.3% in Q4 of '19 and 20.4% last quarter, reflecting the impact of our cost optimization efforts and improved revenue mix.  
Our full year adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, representing 140 basis points full year margin expansion over 2019. We're happy with our operating margins in 2020 given the circumstances and expect to continue improving margins as we deliver ongoing optimization efforts and aim to realize a longer-term benefit from platform modernization.  
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $142 million or $0.46 per diluted share, down from $0.49 in Q4 of '19. The full year GAAP net earnings were $780 million or $2.52 per diluted share and includes gains from divestitures and investment sales. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $241 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, up 4% compared to 75% -- $0.75 in Q4 of '19.  
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $879 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.84, up 6% in 2019 Our GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and 20% for the full year. For 2021, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the 21% to 22% range.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.06 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.34 billion of debt. Our receivables ended the year at $1.17 billion, down $50 million from last quarter. Our Q4 DSO was 76 days, which is down from 81 days in Q3 '20 and up from 72 days in the year ago period. Looking forward, we expect DSO to remain in the 70s.  
Operating cash flow in Q4 was very strong at $513 million. Capital expenditures were $46 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow was a record high of $396 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.437 billion. Capital expenditures were $284 million and capitalized software was $295 million. Full year free cash flow was $857 million, which is up $290 million from 2019, driven by solid operating cash flow and nearly $200 million reduction in capital expenditures.  
For 2021, we expect an increase in free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow growth, continued CapEx control. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the CARES Act payroll tax deferral ending and an increase -- an expected increase in capitalized software related to some focused use of third-party developers to assist with platform modernization work. In total, these 2 items are expected to impact free cash flow by about $150 million, with over 3/4 being tied to payroll taxes.  
Moving to capital allocation. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Kantar Health for $375 million in cash, subject to adjustment. As Don will discuss, this acquisition is a strong complement to our existing Data-as-a-Service efforts and represents a meaningful entry to the pharmaceutical market. We expect the transition to close in the second quarter.  
We also resumed our share repurchase program in Q4 and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million. This brings our total for the year to 10.6 million shares repurchased or $757 million, an average price of $71.07 per share and leaves us with $927 million remaining on our current authorization. Subject to Board approval, we currently expect to repurchase up to $1 billion-plus this year, with the exact amount depending on the amount of cash used for other purposes such as acquisitions beyond the previously discussed Kantar Health deal.  
Moving to our dividend program. In October, we paid a dividend of $0.18 per share or $55 million. In December, we announced a 22% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.22, which was paid on January 12. In summary, we expect to increase capital deployment in 2021 as we fund additional share repurchases, the increased quarterly dividend, the Kantar Health acquisition and possibly other acquisitions or investments. We expect these actions to make better use of our balance sheet after getting to low net leverage position in 2020 as we paused repurchases during the pandemic and received large cash inflows relating to divestitures and investment gains.  
Moving to guidance. As we previously discussed, while we have executed fairly well through the pandemic so far, a considerable amount of uncertainty still exist. So please note that our guidance remains subject to a higher than normal amount of risk.  
I'll start with revenue. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. As a reminder, Q1 of '20 included about $45 million of revenue from our commercial RevWorks and global divested businesses, which is not included in Q1 '21 revenue. The $1.395 billion midpoint of this range represents 2% growth from Q1 '20 after adjusting for these divestitures. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.75 billion and $5.95 billion. In addition to the $45 million of revenue impact from divestitures in Q1, the remaining headwind is approximately $40 million in Q2 -- about $4 million in Q2 for a total of approximately $90 million. More than offsetting this impact for the year is an expected contribution from the Kantar Health acquisition, which we expect to contribute approximately $125 million in Q2 through Q4 based on anticipated closing in early Q2. The $5.85 billion midpoint of the 2021 guidance range represents 6% growth over 2020. Adjusting for both divestiture headwinds and the acquisition also results in 6% growth.  
Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of this range represents 4% growth over Q1 of '20. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.10 to $3.2 with a $3.15 midpoint, reflecting 11% growth over 2020. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.15 to $1.35 million. The midpoint of this range reflects 15% growth over the first quarter of 2020, which included some initial impact from the pandemic which took hold in the last part of the quarter.  
In summary, our 2021 outlook reflects a return to mid single-digit revenue growth with over 100 basis points of margin expansion driving double-digit EPS growth. This guidance is consistent with the long-term framework we shared at our last Investor Day and referenced again when we previewed 2021 on our Q3 '20 call. We note that current adjusted EPS consensus is slightly above our guidance range. It's impacted by a couple of estimates that are not consistent with this framework. Adjusting for these estimates will result in consensus being in our guidance range.  
Note that we don't plan to do an Investor Day as we want Mark Erceg to have time to get up to speed. However, we have updated our long-term plan that is the source of our financial messaging at investor meetings, and the updated plan reflects similar revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth as the framework we shared last year. We also continue to expect our organic top line to be driven by our federal and strategic growth businesses and likely augmented by M&A.
mark will work with the team to determine the best timing for our next investor event, but our strategy and long-term plan remain consistent with past communication, so we think it makes sense to hold off for now. In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the fourth quarter and full year as well as our positive outlook.  
Before turning the call over to Travis, want to say 1 more time how much of an honor has been to be CFO at Cerner. Having spent time with Mark Erceg ahead of his upcoming start date, I'm confident he's going to step in and quickly add value to Cerner, our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Travis."

Today, I want to share my focus as I step into the role of Chief Client and Services Officer, and provide an update on our federal business. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't express my gratitude to John Peterzalek for his steadfast commitment to Cerner's mission and to Brent and our Board for the trust they have placed in me as I take on the role. So many of you know me as the leader of our federal business, and I've had the opportunity to speak with you many times in that capacity. I am entering my 20th year at Cerner and have had the privilege of working across every area of our client and services organization over that period of time. 
Moving forward, I have several guiding principles that will be used to drive our business decisions and lay the foundation for our success. First, we exist to serve our clients. Our clients remain at the center of everything that we do. We must earn the privilege to serve them every day. That means doing what we say we are going to do and providing end-to-end solutions that enable our clients to solve their most pressing challenges and achieve their missions. 
Second, we will play as one team with a focus on delivering value. We need to make it simple for our clients to do business with Cerner. This requires clarity of purpose, alignment of structure and focus on a common set of goals and objectives that are collectively focused on delivering value and improving client satisfaction. 
Third, we must produce the right business results. Results clearly matter, and we will ensure clear lines of accountability with data-driven transparency in pursuit of top and bottom line. We will hold ourselves and our teams accountable for those results. Finally, we'll play to win and strive for excellence. We have lost some key clients in recent years, and that's totally unacceptable. We will bring passion and energy to our work, connect our product strategies to our client needs and embrace internal transformation as a mechanism to achieve excellence for our clients. We're going to aggressively defend our market presence, go on offense in pursuit of competition, and continue to innovate while pursuing opportunities to expand our footprints. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to step into this role, and I look forward to working with our clients around the world to positively impact health care. 
Turning to our federal business. Q4 wrapped up a historic year for the U.S. Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs and the United States Coast Guard. As Brent mentioned, for the first time ever, 3 federal agencies are now leveraging the same EHR and a new Joint Health Information Exchange. Despite facing the challenges of a global pandemic, we delivered on our promises and Cerner Solutions enabled our federal clients to more effectively manage through this crisis. Cerner's mass vaccination solution included in MHS Genesis deployment continues to be utilized across DoD and Coast Guard sites live with the system. As a core member of the Leidos partnership for Defense Health, Cerner continued our work with the DoD and Coast Guard, and we are now live at 20 DoD commands in 4 U.S. Coast Guard sites. 
As we move into '21, we expect to continue our momentum with multiple wave deployments and ongoing sustainment of live facilities. On October 24, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced the first successful go live for their new EHR at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, and its 4 community-based outpatient clinics in Montana, Idaho and Washington. This go-live event include -- also included the West consolidated patient account center, a VA business operations facility in Las Vegas. We are pleased with this progress and continue to work with Mann-Grandstaff on sustainment and system optimization. This work followed the successful implementation of our scheduling solution in Columbus, Ohio; and our Dod, VA and Coast Guard Joint Health Information Exchange go live via eHealth Exchange and CommonWell earlier in 2020. 
VA and Cerner are actively moving forward and preparing for multiple site deployments planned for 2021, including conducting current state reviews, site localization, testing, required interfaces and working with providers at those locations. Cerner, along with our partners, will continue to focus on providing a lifetime of seamless care for our nation's service members and veterans. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Don."
259627,700829337,2206480,"Cerner Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Travis. Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19.

Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19. The first patient that presented noted to a nurse practitioner that he had a cough, and she would learn through the documentation process that he recently returned from overseas travel. He was tested and a day later admitted. Providence CEO, Rod Hochman, tells the story of a whiteboard drawing. As the crisis grew, Hochman wrote 3 acronyms across the board: Before COVID, BC; during COVID, DC; and after COVID, AC. 
It was Hochman's effort to simplify the complex and more importantly, to drive strategies to manage it. And amid hundreds of different client conversations over the course of 2020, Hochman's framing stuck with me. Our push to integrate the health system enterprise, advance the health network and create a data-driven health economy began before COVID. We rallied as an organization to progress those strategies during COVID and we see an unparalleled opportunity to lead in all 3 areas after COVID. 
At the enterprise level, our focus is simple. Every client is working to increase the revenue of key service lines, lower unit costs and manage within a larger health network and the ZIP codes where they operate. Cerner Solutions must enable an integrated delivery system with 1 record, 1 plan and 1 bill. 
Over the course of 2020, several health system enterprise solutions delivered during COVID impact. Our real-time health system business drove over $110 million in booked revenue, representing over 85% growth year-over-year. Workforce and capacity management, hospital operations, provider communications, they've all been essential crisis response capabilities during COVID and will be pivotal to tackling total cost of care after it. 
In the revenue cycle space, we launched our engage and access offering in the first quarter. It provided clients the tools they need to drive access management as they responded to COVID disruptions and rethink how scheduling and registration should work in a digital-first enterprise. 
Finally, our consumer business sought to build a unified experience centered on the person. The business generated more than $175 million in bookings in 2020, growing at more than 150% year-over-year. 
Our clients need us to move even faster on our whole person solution suite in 2021, and  David Bradshaw and his team are bringing strategic urgency to those efforts. The biggest trend in provider health care before, during and after COVID centers on the push for vertical integration beyond the 4 walls of a hospital. This mix of owned and affiliated physician practices, post-acute care facilities and the home as venue are critical nodes on the health networks being built out in every community. These health network strategies have diverse contractual frameworks and disparate technologies and our HealtheIntent platform is purpose-built to integrate and manage them. 
Amid the market disruption of COVID, our health network business delivered more than 20% bookings growth year-over-year. [ Kim Lovik ] and the team also added 23 new HealtheIntent footprints, almost 1/3 of which were outside of our Millennium base. As the health network team looks out after COVID, our strategic objectives are simple: One, we have to grow share of the health network wallet, adding lives and solutions to each client relationship; two, we have to continue to expand into new geographies, both in the U.S. and in our 5 global focus regions; three, we have to win new buyers, including traditional payers, employers and governments. They are the 1, 2, 3 by 2023 work to be done to build a $1 billion health network business by 2025. 
Our multi-decade efforts at the health system enterprise and now at the health network level have created a set of strong only Cerner differentiators. Cerner has an industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize provider health care data, it is the structure store and study promise of the systems thinking that we've built at Cerner in the 1990s and the 2000s and still today. We also have a deep understanding of the last mile provider workflow. It's the closed loop connection that allows us to deliver the right information at the right time and the right place to drive the right outcome. 
Over the course of 2020, we launched a learning health network that attracted 55 client members, representing almost 100 million patients and more than 500 million encounters. We launched our COVID data cohort, attracting some of the most notable names in academic research and generating dozens of peer-reviewed studies. We advanced our strategic objective to build out a total solution offering for late-stage clinical trials. As Brent noted, we differentiated our strategies by winning new business with UBC, signing a new partnership and investment with Elligo Health Research and with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Kantar Health. 
Before COVID, real-world evidence was beginning to disrupt traditional clinical trials. During COVID, regulatory response to the pandemic has accelerated this shift and how therapeutic discoveries are advanced. And after COVID, Cerner's large provider client base, first and last mile data expertise, offer us an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine this market. 
For leaders on the front lines of the COVID crisis, I will tell you that the stories stick with you. Our clients tell us about the first cases at their health systems. They share with you stories about families being forced to check on relatives on FaceTime because they couldn't be at the bedside. And they worry aloud about caregivers as hospitalization and case fatality rates become the tough daily work to be managed. And yet, for all of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, CEOs can't leave a team's call without seeing post-pandemic possibilities. They all have some version of before COVID, during COVID and after COVID in their head. 
Our broad market opportunity is the same one that we're advancing today at Providence around areas like Xealth, new digital therapies and applications, as well as the deployment of our new well-being platform as COVID redefines employee health. Amid all of that, we are pleased with the 2020 progress that was made and excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And literally, I can't keep up with a number of new companies, new businesses, new models that are out there, and they're all innovative and do modest stuff.

You're trying to regain them, but then also, as you go in these new areas, how do you convince those people that we're not just the old Cerner and why they shouldn't go with some newer model. Just sort of would love some perspective about them."

So fundamentally, I would say that's the way in which we built the company, and that's the opportunity set in front of us in the 5 years ahead. 
The second thing I would say is, as I think about strategies around health network and I think about strategies around the data space, particularly what we're doing around life sciences and pharma, they are highly aligned with the business strategies of our traditional clients. So we are always at our best when we're building technologies and advancing solution strategies that are aligned to with business objectives of our provider clients. And we think that the strategies that we're advancing absolutely do that. And then the final thing I would say is the execution need for us is to make sure that we are thinking through capital allocation strategies in a way that not only works for our provider clients, but also allows us to begin to think about new buyer types beyond our provider base, whether that's payer, an employer and government opportunities around network or that's life sciences and pharma around the data space. So I think that's what we're working on, and I think you articulated it well."

Our goal is to take them from where they are and take them along that continuum related to our vision and their needs. So we plan to be aggressive, and we plan to work across that entire continuum. And from my perspective, we're going to fight in the core, and we're going to work hard in the core to make sure that we keep our clients current, that we meet their expectations, that we do what we say. That gives us an opportunity to extend and expand in that existing client base. And from my view, that's really an opportunity for us and to amplify the work that Don is describing related to strategic growth so that we can take those core clients along that journey over time. 
So it's crucial that we do the basics, the block and tackling of keeping commitments, meeting commitments, keeping clients current, doing what we're saying we're going to do so that we can extend and expand and move them forward. And then furthermore, I think it gives us opportunity to continue growth in federal and also potentially some targeted global opportunity and again, with force multiplier of the work we're doing in strategic growth. So I don't view them as separate things. I view it as 1 thing, treating our clients, right, listening, solving their problems and then taking them on that journey with us."

So first of all, I think we start by thinking about what's the strategic differentiators that we bring to the space. And so I think the clinical data asset that we have, including traceability around that data and its province is a critical differentiator for us when you think about clinical trial activity. 
The second thing is the ability to have a patient and provider access as part of how we actually think about tackling, time and cost basis for clinical trial activity. So we start there with those differentiators. I think what Kantar gives us then is the ability to take a long-standing competency around data linking and data curation and to include some really significant a PhD MD and epidemiological capabilities to really make sure that we can fulfill the value proposition that life sciences and pharma companies are looking for, for late-stage trial activity. 
And then to your question around how we go to market, I think the activity to date has taken different forms. I think the Elligo investment in partnership is really around strategies associated with site activation for our provider clients who are participating or will participate in those clinical trials. I think Kantar gives us both proprietary data assets and domain expertise, but also the ability to then begin to start thinking about those call points within life sciences and pharma to actually originate those contractual opportunities and drive revenue. 
So yes, we've partnered with UBC and other CROs, and that's a dimensional aspect of, I think, how we validated our capabilities. But I think we're excited about what we can do with the business as constituted in 2021. And  I think to Marc's point, look at other opportunities for inorganic acquisition and further growth in this space as we play forward our strategy."

So we're going to have a reinvigorated strategy around them. And it's going to be on Travis' watch.

I mean 1 is we've talked about it, but our core clients are important, I mean, the heart and soul of Cerner in a lot of ways, they've been with us a long time. It's really important for us because we do well when our clients are current, and we're investing and we're working with them to keep them current. It gives us opportunity to extend those agreements, but it also gives us white space to expand with new solution capabilities. So it's very important that we focus there. 
The federal business, I've had the pleasure of leading that business for the last 6 years. I think we have continued solid opportunity there. I think we have opportunity beyond our core contracts. I see potential for us with new agency work. I see potential with the work that we're doing in strategic growth to go do work with them on the network side. And so I do think federal continues to be an opportunity for us. And I think we'll become more and more efficient in that business as time goes by, particularly in how we deliver service, how we behave as a prime contractor and also probably the use of third-party resources. 
And then I've mentioned the amplification of strategic growth multiple times, but I think that as we develop those capabilities, we have the opportunity to take them into our client base and our markets in really an aggressive and strategic way. And I think that gives us opportunity to have the right line of business mix as well as we push forward. And then M&A is an enabling strategy. I don't know. For me, it has to support the core strategy, and we're doing that, and we're putting our capital to use. So I think those 4 or 5 key areas will be our focus for go to market, and then ensuring that we deliver on an end-to-end service basis in the most efficient way possible, also have a pretty extensive delivery background on the services side, so we'll be focused on proper delivery."

Certainly, our activity on the M&A side could impact that somewhat, and we're going to apply our capital in the best way possible. But I think from a margin expansion view, certainly, our long-term view that we shared that remains in place is 100-plus bps of increase in margins every year. The midpoint of our guidance achieved more than that 100 bps. And it's going to come from a variety of places. 
I think a key thing to remember for the people that might be looking for why isn't there more margin expansion in this year? Going through 2020, we accelerated some of our savings opportunities and our cost optimization in order to deliver the results we were able to deliver on the earnings line for the year. So we pulled some things forward, which means we're still working, we still have additional opportunities. 
But those were kind of across expense lines, and some of them will hit in the gross margin line, too, from a cost perspective. So they'll be spread pretty much throughout. There isn't any 1 thing we're relying on particularly to drive it. Almost all of it is already in process. And is just really going and realizing the benefit that we began the process of driving in 2020."

I mean, it's listening to your clients and solving their problems every day, holding our folks accountable for results. It's really, I think, embracing our internal mission to transform. Some of the work that we're doing to better connect client needs to our product capabilities, I think, is absolutely critical for us as it relates to better service delivery to our core clients. And it's really -- it's absolutely focusing on what I call the say-do ratio. If you say it, you got to do it. 
And so those are things that are really relevant to our core clients. We have to make sure that we uplift those clients and we have them current. Our current clients stay with us, and so I think a real focus from us on that element is very important. It makes it easier for them to test to train. It makes it easier for us to use the data in a meaningful way. And so I think it's really back to executing in the right way on the basics and then covering them fully. Relationships matter. And we've got to cover those clients in a way that matters to them. And it's also important that they understand. 
And the point I was trying to make earlier, we're not abandoning the core. We're focused on that, while we continue to innovate, while we continue to develop capabilities and thought leadership, we're doing that on behalf of those core clients, and we want them to be on that journey with us. And so I think clean, crisp, clear messaging is really important for us as we -- as I call it, bring back the swagger with that group of clients, and they have to understand what we're doing and why and how we're bringing them along. And so I think those are really the basic principles that we're going to try to bring forward."

Maybe just with the eye to the midterm, my thoughts would be similar that if you just think about it simplistically, the core is absolutely foundational, as Travis just said, as we've all said today. There's a lot of opportunity in the core. And that comes through defending the core and expanding the core, and there is room to expand the core through white space that's available, delivering solutions into that space. So shoring that up, executing very well in that area is key. 
Federal, of course, is absolutely critical. And glad to have things on track there and Travis' leadership in that area and now a leadership in that same drive going to our full commercial organization. And strategic growth, again, executing our plans as laid out. And there is a loop back because the strategic growth has a strong correlation to how well we do in the core and how solid we are in the core. So making sure we've made that connection, those relationships, that execution is very solid, is key. 
And then just as we've laid out, the transformation work is critical because having standard ways of operating and making us effective operating at the scale is critical in finding deficiencies in the business that allow us to continue to invest in innovation. Those are really the keys in the midterm. So the primary emphasis is execution."

But that movement will kind of -- will occur over some period of time relative to our -- relative to the -- from a financial impact, there's -- it will vary a little bit. 
But for the most part, a lot of our business today is designed to -- we have a hosting business already. We have elements of recurring revenue that are similar to SaaS in a way. Certainly, as we start evolving and moving millennium more to a cloud, like there'll be a point at which you switch over to some SaaS accounting, which could have an impact on some of the implementation services and the timing of recognizing some of that revenue. But a lot of it is pretty consistent to what we have. 
The timing of it, as I said, for Millennium, it really is more of an evolution. There is more work to do there, more modernization of the platform. We're spending a lot of time on. And a lot of our resources are going into that modernization. So I'm pretty confident that by the end of my tenure, it will all be done. But given that's only about 30 days, that probably doesn't really count. But it is a process. 
And certainly, as that process continues, and we get a better view of milestones and waypoints, we'll be able to give you an update kind of on what the financial impact is. But once again, the business today operates, a lot of the elements of it are recurring in nature. So those would be similar to what you see in a SaaS model to a great extent."

The cloud technologies hold a significant value proposition for our clients around product and platform modernization. So government is the largest payer. It creates opportunities for them to think about regulatory and currency faster. And it creates opportunities for them to adopt functionality quicker. It allows them to think about reduction in total cost of ownership or redirection of dollars to things that they think will innovate and grow their business. 
So you can see that with HealtheIntent that the value proposition is front and center. CareAware has been great for us because it's really allowed us to work through, not just the technical components, but to Marc's point, also some of the nontechnical contractual and inside the 4 walls topics that have to be surfaced. And we're already making progress on Millennium in terms of high-value workflows oriented around the cloud, and we'll continue to be selective about how we progress that approach. And I think it will play into a narrative around value proposition for our core clients and enablement of a bunch of our strategic growth efforts, inclusive of the work of HealtheIntent."

And fundamentally, what we see, [ Alan ], is they're working on the same problem set in many ways that our Millennium and non-Millennium provider clients are.

So that's a little bit of what the mix of the business looks like. 
And then you're also right, which is, look, the opportunity set we see is around our provider clients associated with those RWE-related opportunities later stage, and so the Elligo assets allow us to really begin to think through those site activation strategies, particularly for the community hospitals and IDNs that are part of that enhanced data arrangement that Brent described and allow us to then begin to think about participating in those later stage and larger contract opportunities, much as we probe it out, both with DCRI, the Duke CRO and also in 2020 with UBC."

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance.

I'd like to start with a few comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. And then I'll hand it over to CFO, Marc Naughton; and our new Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton; and then our President, Don Trigg, for some more marketplace commentary.  
Well, 2020 was a remarkable year for all of us. And given the circumstances, Cerner delivered solid results by executing on our plans and really focusing on supporting our clients. The pandemic challenged Cerner and our clients on several fronts, and we continue to be extremely proud to support clients who are battling COVID on the front lines each and every day. And we're very pleased with the way our associates seamlessly transitioned to a remote work environment last March and have really remained productive and focused on our client success throughout this whole period.  
I'm also proud that Cerner recently began hosting a series of massive vaccination events at our world headquarters. This is done through a collaboration with North Kansas City Hospital, Liberty Hospital, Clay County Public Health Center in cities within Clay County. This initiative called Operation Safe is being staffed by volunteers from Cerner, North Kansas City Hospital and several partners in the community.  
And together, we've vaccinated nearly 5,000 people through 1 week, and we have additional events planned in the weeks ahead. And I've often said that Cerner's -- one of Cerner's strongest assets is how mission-driven our people are. And the willingness of our associates to rise to the challenge of this pandemic has really presented a strong demonstration of that commitment throughout the whole year.  
In addition to supporting our clients and communities, we continue to advance our growth strategies and make operational improvements as part of Cerner's ongoing transformation in 2020. As COVID accelerated health care macro trends, it also validated our growth initiatives, including the creation and expansion of health networks, our real-time health system capabilities in consumer-facing health strategies.  
Cerner is providing data-driven insights that can improve our clients' clinical, operational and financial outcomes. Our recent investment in Elligo Health Research in agreement to acquire Kantar Health are examples of how we're deploying capital to advance Cerner's growth strategies. And Don will provide more detail about these -- how these investments accelerate Cerner's presence in life sciences and create a strong foundation for our Data-as-a-Service business.  
We also continue toward our transformation goals. Cerner's transformation has been focused on simplifying the business, creating operational efficiencies and delivering profitable growth. And we're nearing $300 million in annualized cost reductions since beginning our transformation efforts about 2 years ago. And we believe those efficiencies and our resilient business model really helped mitigate the impacts of COVID on our business.  
As part of our portfolio management process, we simplified our product set to go from offering more than 25,000 features to really fewer than 400 products. And we also divested RevWorks outsourcing business in some noncore global assets. Importantly, our work to deliver seamless care for 18 million service members and veterans remains on track. And for the first time in history, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Coast Guard are using the same electronic health record. And the number of patients in our Joint Health Information Exchange grew from 700,000 to 4 million since April of last year.  
Finally, we supported the evolution and transformation of our business by adding proven leaders who are already bringing a new perspective. Our Chief Technology Officer, Jerome Labat, joined us in June, bringing more than 30 years of CTO and product development experience at Fortune 500 and leading global tech companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intuit and Oracle. 
In September, Chief Strategy Officer, Will Mintz, came to Cerner after working with leading health care and technology businesses, including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield. You probably know Chief Client and Services Officer, Travis Dalton, from his leadership in our federal business. And we're excited to have Travis now bringing that same leadership to our global client base, while retaining oversight of our critically important federal work. Mark Erceg is our most recent appointment and will replace long time Cerner CFO, Marc Naughton, on February 22. Mark is a high energy leader, who will bring more than 25 years of financial leadership experience, including driving transformation across complex global operations and leveraging balance sheets to drive growth and shareholder value.  
In addition to those leaders, we are also honored to have Major General Elder Granger join the Cerner Board of Directors in November. And Dr. Granger is a proven leader with experiences in clinical, military and business environments. 
And before I close, I'd like to acknowledge that this is our last earnings call with CFO, Marc Naughton, who, after nearly 30 years of service and 101 earnings calls, will be leaving Cerner at the end of the first quarter. And I know many of you share my appreciation for Marc and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. And Marc, I just have to say, I cannot imagine anything more fun than 101 earnings calls.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished in 2020. We delivered toward our revised expectations while driving a significant amount of change in what we all have to say was a very unusual year in health care. It was very hard work. And I sincerely appreciate all Cerner associates in their contributions to this progress. And Marc, let me now turn it over to you for call number 101."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover Q4 results and future guidance. This quarter, we delivered all key metrics in line with our expectations.  
I'll start with bookings, which were $1.68 billion, over $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Full year bookings were $5.585 billion, which is down from $5.99 billion in 2019, primarily driven by the impacts of pandemic and divestitures of our commercial RevWorks and certain global businesses in Q3. We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $13.04 billion, which is down 5% from a year ago, due primarily to the impact of divestitures.  
Our backlog revenue, combined with other contracted revenue that is excluded from the ASC 606 backlog definition, still provides visibility to more than 85% of expected revenue over the next 12 months. Revenue in the quarter of $1.395 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range and represents roughly 1% year-over-year growth after adjusting for divestitures. Total revenue for the year was $5.506 billion, which also reflects approximately 1% growth from 2019 after adjusting for divestitures.  
I'll now go through the business model detail and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 '19 and full year 2019. Licensed software revenue in Q4 was flat year-over-year at $174 million. Full year licensed software revenue declined 4% from 2019 to $656 million due to pandemic-driven declines in traditional software, partially offset by growth in software and service revenue, which now makes up approximately 60% of total software revenue. 
To date, this shift has been driven primarily by growth in SaaS revenue related to healthy intent-based solutions. Going forward, we expect this shift to continue for additional factors and -- for additional factors to contribute, including changes this year in how we deliver in contracts for CareAware and CommunityWorks. Given the relatively small sizes of these businesses, the impact of the changes will not be significant. But we expect to use this transition as a guide for a broader move to SaaS with Millennium, which will occur as we continue to advance our platform and modernization.  
Technology resale in Q4 was down 8% year-over-year to $56 million and in line with our expectations. Full year technology resale revenue was down 20% to $197 million, primarily due to a tough overall environment for technology resale and the impact of the pandemic. Subscriptions revenue grew 6% in Q4 to $98 million and grew 5% for the full year to $378 million. Professional services revenue was down 6% in Q4 to $478 million and was down 3% for the full year to $1.93 billion, due primarily to the impact of the pandemic, divestitures, the termination of our large rentals agreement in 2019 and lower third-party services. 
Declines driven by these factors were partially offset by continued strength in federal professional services. Managed services was up 2% in Q4 to $317 million and up 3% for the full year to $1.245 billion. Support and maintenance of $263 million was down 4% in Q4 and down 3% for the full year to $1.071 billion due to the impact of divestitures, attrition and reduced hardware and maintenance revenue. And finally, reimbursed travel of $8 million was down 63% in Q4, down 71% for the full year at $28 million due pandemic-driven travel restrictions.  
Looking at revenue by geographic segment. Domestic revenue was down 3% from the year ago quarter at $1.23 billion, and non-U.S. revenue of $161 million was also down 3% from the year ago quarter, due -- primarily due to the divestiture of assets in Germany and Spain. For the full year, domestic revenue was down 3% and non-U.S. revenue declined 4% due to the impact of the pandemic as well as divestitures.
Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin for Q4 was up 240 basis points from a year ago to 83.2%, and full year was up 190 basis points over 2019 to 83.1, reflecting improved revenue mix due to less outsourcing, third-party services, technology resale and reimbursed travel.  
Now I will discuss spending, operating margin and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP, adjusted and non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, organizational restructuring and other expenses, COVID-19-related expense and allowance on a noncurrent asset, gains on the sale of businesses and other adjustments that are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release.  
Looking at our operating spending, our fourth quarter GAAP operating expenses of $987 million were basically flat compared to $982 million in the year ago quarter. Full year GAAP operating expenses were $2.879 billion, down 4% from $4.021 billion in 2019. Our adjusted operating expenses of $860 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared to Q4 of '19. And full year 2020 decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to our continued cost optimization efforts, divestitures and lower travel expense. 
Looking at the line items for Q4, sales and client service expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by lower non-personnel expense and divestitures. Software development expense increased 4% from Q4 of '19, with gross R&D up 6% and a slight increase in net capitalized software. G&A expense in Q4 was down 9%, driven by a decline in both personnel and nonpersonnel expenses.  
Moving to operating margins. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 12.7%, flat to the year ago period. Our GAAP operating margin for full year 2020 was 16.6% compared to 10.6% in 2019. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up from 20.3% in Q4 of '19 and 20.4% last quarter, reflecting the impact of our cost optimization efforts and improved revenue mix.  
Our full year adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, representing 140 basis points full year margin expansion over 2019. We're happy with our operating margins in 2020 given the circumstances and expect to continue improving margins as we deliver ongoing optimization efforts and aim to realize a longer-term benefit from platform modernization.  
Moving to net earnings and EPS. Our GAAP net earnings in Q4 were $142 million or $0.46 per diluted share, down from $0.49 in Q4 of '19. The full year GAAP net earnings were $780 million or $2.52 per diluted share and includes gains from divestitures and investment sales. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 were $241 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, up 4% compared to 75% -- $0.75 in Q4 of '19.  
For the full year, adjusted net earnings were $879 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.84, up 6% in 2019 Our GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and 20% for the full year. For 2021, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the 21% to 22% range.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.06 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.34 billion of debt. Our receivables ended the year at $1.17 billion, down $50 million from last quarter. Our Q4 DSO was 76 days, which is down from 81 days in Q3 '20 and up from 72 days in the year ago period. Looking forward, we expect DSO to remain in the 70s.  
Operating cash flow in Q4 was very strong at $513 million. Capital expenditures were $46 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow was a record high of $396 million for the quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.437 billion. Capital expenditures were $284 million and capitalized software was $295 million. Full year free cash flow was $857 million, which is up $290 million from 2019, driven by solid operating cash flow and nearly $200 million reduction in capital expenditures.  
For 2021, we expect an increase in free cash flow, driven by operating cash flow growth, continued CapEx control. This growth is expected to be partially offset by the CARES Act payroll tax deferral ending and an increase -- an expected increase in capitalized software related to some focused use of third-party developers to assist with platform modernization work. In total, these 2 items are expected to impact free cash flow by about $150 million, with over 3/4 being tied to payroll taxes.  
Moving to capital allocation. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Kantar Health for $375 million in cash, subject to adjustment. As Don will discuss, this acquisition is a strong complement to our existing Data-as-a-Service efforts and represents a meaningful entry to the pharmaceutical market. We expect the transition to close in the second quarter.  
We also resumed our share repurchase program in Q4 and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $107 million. This brings our total for the year to 10.6 million shares repurchased or $757 million, an average price of $71.07 per share and leaves us with $927 million remaining on our current authorization. Subject to Board approval, we currently expect to repurchase up to $1 billion-plus this year, with the exact amount depending on the amount of cash used for other purposes such as acquisitions beyond the previously discussed Kantar Health deal.  
Moving to our dividend program. In October, we paid a dividend of $0.18 per share or $55 million. In December, we announced a 22% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.22, which was paid on January 12. In summary, we expect to increase capital deployment in 2021 as we fund additional share repurchases, the increased quarterly dividend, the Kantar Health acquisition and possibly other acquisitions or investments. We expect these actions to make better use of our balance sheet after getting to low net leverage position in 2020 as we paused repurchases during the pandemic and received large cash inflows relating to divestitures and investment gains.  
Moving to guidance. As we previously discussed, while we have executed fairly well through the pandemic so far, a considerable amount of uncertainty still exist. So please note that our guidance remains subject to a higher than normal amount of risk.  
I'll start with revenue. We expect revenue in Q1 to be between $1.37 billion and $1.42 billion. As a reminder, Q1 of '20 included about $45 million of revenue from our commercial RevWorks and global divested businesses, which is not included in Q1 '21 revenue. The $1.395 billion midpoint of this range represents 2% growth from Q1 '20 after adjusting for these divestitures. For the full year, we expect revenue between $5.75 billion and $5.95 billion. In addition to the $45 million of revenue impact from divestitures in Q1, the remaining headwind is approximately $40 million in Q2 -- about $4 million in Q2 for a total of approximately $90 million. More than offsetting this impact for the year is an expected contribution from the Kantar Health acquisition, which we expect to contribute approximately $125 million in Q2 through Q4 based on anticipated closing in early Q2. The $5.85 billion midpoint of the 2021 guidance range represents 6% growth over 2020. Adjusting for both divestiture headwinds and the acquisition also results in 6% growth.  
Moving to EPS. We expect Q1 diluted -- adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.72 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of this range represents 4% growth over Q1 of '20. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.10 to $3.2 with a $3.15 midpoint, reflecting 11% growth over 2020. 
Moving to bookings guidance. We expect bookings revenue in Q1 of $1.15 to $1.35 million. The midpoint of this range reflects 15% growth over the first quarter of 2020, which included some initial impact from the pandemic which took hold in the last part of the quarter.  
In summary, our 2021 outlook reflects a return to mid single-digit revenue growth with over 100 basis points of margin expansion driving double-digit EPS growth. This guidance is consistent with the long-term framework we shared at our last Investor Day and referenced again when we previewed 2021 on our Q3 '20 call. We note that current adjusted EPS consensus is slightly above our guidance range. It's impacted by a couple of estimates that are not consistent with this framework. Adjusting for these estimates will result in consensus being in our guidance range.  
Note that we don't plan to do an Investor Day as we want Mark Erceg to have time to get up to speed. However, we have updated our long-term plan that is the source of our financial messaging at investor meetings, and the updated plan reflects similar revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth as the framework we shared last year. We also continue to expect our organic top line to be driven by our federal and strategic growth businesses and likely augmented by M&A.
mark will work with the team to determine the best timing for our next investor event, but our strategy and long-term plan remain consistent with past communication, so we think it makes sense to hold off for now. In summary, we are pleased with our solid results in the fourth quarter and full year as well as our positive outlook.  
Before turning the call over to Travis, want to say 1 more time how much of an honor has been to be CFO at Cerner. Having spent time with Mark Erceg ahead of his upcoming start date, I'm confident he's going to step in and quickly add value to Cerner, our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Travis."

Today, I want to share my focus as I step into the role of Chief Client and Services Officer, and provide an update on our federal business. First, I'd be remiss if I didn't express my gratitude to John Peterzalek for his steadfast commitment to Cerner's mission and to Brent and our Board for the trust they have placed in me as I take on the role. So many of you know me as the leader of our federal business, and I've had the opportunity to speak with you many times in that capacity. I am entering my 20th year at Cerner and have had the privilege of working across every area of our client and services organization over that period of time. 
Moving forward, I have several guiding principles that will be used to drive our business decisions and lay the foundation for our success. First, we exist to serve our clients. Our clients remain at the center of everything that we do. We must earn the privilege to serve them every day. That means doing what we say we are going to do and providing end-to-end solutions that enable our clients to solve their most pressing challenges and achieve their missions. 
Second, we will play as one team with a focus on delivering value. We need to make it simple for our clients to do business with Cerner. This requires clarity of purpose, alignment of structure and focus on a common set of goals and objectives that are collectively focused on delivering value and improving client satisfaction. 
Third, we must produce the right business results. Results clearly matter, and we will ensure clear lines of accountability with data-driven transparency in pursuit of top and bottom line. We will hold ourselves and our teams accountable for those results. Finally, we'll play to win and strive for excellence. We have lost some key clients in recent years, and that's totally unacceptable. We will bring passion and energy to our work, connect our product strategies to our client needs and embrace internal transformation as a mechanism to achieve excellence for our clients. We're going to aggressively defend our market presence, go on offense in pursuit of competition, and continue to innovate while pursuing opportunities to expand our footprints. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to step into this role, and I look forward to working with our clients around the world to positively impact health care. 
Turning to our federal business. Q4 wrapped up a historic year for the U.S. Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs and the United States Coast Guard. As Brent mentioned, for the first time ever, 3 federal agencies are now leveraging the same EHR and a new Joint Health Information Exchange. Despite facing the challenges of a global pandemic, we delivered on our promises and Cerner Solutions enabled our federal clients to more effectively manage through this crisis. Cerner's mass vaccination solution included in MHS Genesis deployment continues to be utilized across DoD and Coast Guard sites live with the system. As a core member of the Leidos partnership for Defense Health, Cerner continued our work with the DoD and Coast Guard, and we are now live at 20 DoD commands in 4 U.S. Coast Guard sites. 
As we move into '21, we expect to continue our momentum with multiple wave deployments and ongoing sustainment of live facilities. On October 24, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced the first successful go live for their new EHR at Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, and its 4 community-based outpatient clinics in Montana, Idaho and Washington. This go-live event include -- also included the West consolidated patient account center, a VA business operations facility in Las Vegas. We are pleased with this progress and continue to work with Mann-Grandstaff on sustainment and system optimization. This work followed the successful implementation of our scheduling solution in Columbus, Ohio; and our Dod, VA and Coast Guard Joint Health Information Exchange go live via eHealth Exchange and CommonWell earlier in 2020. 
VA and Cerner are actively moving forward and preparing for multiple site deployments planned for 2021, including conducting current state reviews, site localization, testing, required interfaces and working with providers at those locations. Cerner, along with our partners, will continue to focus on providing a lifetime of seamless care for our nation's service members and veterans. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Don."
259627,700829337,2219039,"Cerner Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2021",2021-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Cerner Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Travis. Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19.

Providence Health in Seattle was ground zero for COVID-19. The first patient that presented noted to a nurse practitioner that he had a cough, and she would learn through the documentation process that he recently returned from overseas travel. He was tested and a day later admitted. Providence CEO, Rod Hochman, tells the story of a whiteboard drawing. As the crisis grew, Hochman wrote 3 acronyms across the board: Before COVID, BC; during COVID, DC; and after COVID, AC. 
It was Hochman's effort to simplify the complex and more importantly, to drive strategies to manage it. And amid hundreds of different client conversations over the course of 2020, Hochman's framing stuck with me. Our push to integrate the health system enterprise, advance the health network and create a data-driven health economy began before COVID. We rallied as an organization to progress those strategies during COVID and we see an unparalleled opportunity to lead in all 3 areas after COVID. 
At the enterprise level, our focus is simple. Every client is working to increase the revenue of key service lines, lower unit costs and manage within a larger health network and the ZIP codes where they operate. Cerner Solutions must enable an integrated delivery system with 1 record, 1 plan and 1 bill. 
Over the course of 2020, several health system enterprise solutions delivered during COVID impact. Our real-time health system business drove over $110 million in booked revenue, representing over 85% growth year-over-year. Workforce and capacity management, hospital operations, provider communications, they've all been essential crisis response capabilities during COVID and will be pivotal to tackling total cost of care after it. 
In the revenue cycle space, we launched our engage and access offering in the first quarter. It provided clients the tools they need to drive access management as they responded to COVID disruptions and rethink how scheduling and registration should work in a digital-first enterprise. 
Finally, our consumer business sought to build a unified experience centered on the person. The business generated more than $175 million in bookings in 2020, growing at more than 150% year-over-year. 
Our clients need us to move even faster on our whole person solution suite in 2021, and  David Bradshaw and his team are bringing strategic urgency to those efforts. The biggest trend in provider health care before, during and after COVID centers on the push for vertical integration beyond the 4 walls of a hospital. This mix of owned and affiliated physician practices, post-acute care facilities and the home as venue are critical nodes on the health networks being built out in every community. These health network strategies have diverse contractual frameworks and disparate technologies and our HealtheIntent platform is purpose-built to integrate and manage them. 
Amid the market disruption of COVID, our health network business delivered more than 20% bookings growth year-over-year. [ Kim Lovik ] and the team also added 23 new HealtheIntent footprints, almost 1/3 of which were outside of our Millennium base. As the health network team looks out after COVID, our strategic objectives are simple: One, we have to grow share of the health network wallet, adding lives and solutions to each client relationship; two, we have to continue to expand into new geographies, both in the U.S. and in our 5 global focus regions; three, we have to win new buyers, including traditional payers, employers and governments. They are the 1, 2, 3 by 2023 work to be done to build a $1 billion health network business by 2025. 
Our multi-decade efforts at the health system enterprise and now at the health network level have created a set of strong only Cerner differentiators. Cerner has an industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize provider health care data, it is the structure store and study promise of the systems thinking that we've built at Cerner in the 1990s and the 2000s and still today. We also have a deep understanding of the last mile provider workflow. It's the closed loop connection that allows us to deliver the right information at the right time and the right place to drive the right outcome. 
Over the course of 2020, we launched a learning health network that attracted 55 client members, representing almost 100 million patients and more than 500 million encounters. We launched our COVID data cohort, attracting some of the most notable names in academic research and generating dozens of peer-reviewed studies. We advanced our strategic objective to build out a total solution offering for late-stage clinical trials. As Brent noted, we differentiated our strategies by winning new business with UBC, signing a new partnership and investment with Elligo Health Research and with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Kantar Health. 
Before COVID, real-world evidence was beginning to disrupt traditional clinical trials. During COVID, regulatory response to the pandemic has accelerated this shift and how therapeutic discoveries are advanced. And after COVID, Cerner's large provider client base, first and last mile data expertise, offer us an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine this market. 
For leaders on the front lines of the COVID crisis, I will tell you that the stories stick with you. Our clients tell us about the first cases at their health systems. They share with you stories about families being forced to check on relatives on FaceTime because they couldn't be at the bedside. And they worry aloud about caregivers as hospitalization and case fatality rates become the tough daily work to be managed. And yet, for all of the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, CEOs can't leave a team's call without seeing post-pandemic possibilities. They all have some version of before COVID, during COVID and after COVID in their head. 
Our broad market opportunity is the same one that we're advancing today at Providence around areas like Xealth, new digital therapies and applications, as well as the deployment of our new well-being platform as COVID redefines employee health. Amid all of that, we are pleased with the 2020 progress that was made and excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2021. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And literally, I can't keep up with a number of new companies, new businesses, new models that are out there, and they're all innovative and do modest stuff.

You're trying to regain them, but then also, as you go in these new areas, how do you convince those people that we're not just the old Cerner and why they shouldn't go with some newer model. Just sort of would love some perspective about them."

So what's the ability to both work on the business as it's defined today and simultaneously, identify new growth opportunities that are both adjacencies and as you said, new markets. So fundamentally, I would say that's the way in which we built the company, and that's the opportunity set in front of us in the 5 years ahead. 
The second thing I would say is, as I think about strategies around health network and I think about strategies around the data space, particularly what we're doing around life sciences and pharma, they are highly aligned with the business strategies of our traditional clients. So we are always at our best when we're building technologies and advancing solution strategies that are aligned to with business objectives of our provider clients. And we think that the strategies that we're advancing absolutely do that. And then the final thing I would say is the execution need for us is to make sure that we are thinking through capital allocation strategies in a way that not only works for our provider clients, but also allows us to begin to think about new buyer types beyond our provider base, whether that's payer, an employer and government opportunities around network or that's life sciences and pharma around the data space. So I think that's what we're working on, and I think you articulated it well."

Our goal is to take them from where they are and take them along that continuum related to our vision and their needs. So we plan to be aggressive, and we plan to work across that entire continuum. And from my perspective, we're going to fight in the core, and we're going to work hard in the core to make sure that we keep our clients current, that we meet their expectations, that we do what we say. That gives us an opportunity to extend and expand in that existing client base. And from my view, that's really an opportunity for us and to amplify the work that Don is describing related to strategic growth so that we can take those core clients along that journey over time. 
So it's crucial that we do the basics, the block and tackling of keeping commitments, meeting commitments, keeping clients current, doing what we're saying we're going to do so that we can extend and expand and move them forward. And then furthermore, I think it gives us opportunity to continue growth in federal and also potentially some targeted global opportunity and again, with force multiplier of the work we're doing in strategic growth. So I don't view them as separate things. I view it as 1 thing, treating our clients, right, listening, solving their problems and then taking them on that journey with us."

The second thing is the ability to have a patient and provider access as part of how we actually think about tackling, time and cost basis for clinical trial activity. So we start there with those differentiators. I think what Kantar gives us then is the ability to take a long-standing competency around data linking and data curation and to include some really significant a PhD MD and epidemiological capabilities to really make sure that we can fulfill the value proposition that life sciences and pharma companies are looking for, for late-stage trial activity. 
And then to your question around how we go to market, I think the activity to date has taken different forms. I think the Elligo investment in partnership is really around strategies associated with site activation for our provider clients who are participating or will participate in those clinical trials. I think Kantar gives us both proprietary data assets and domain expertise, but also the ability to then begin to start thinking about those call points within life sciences and pharma to actually originate those contractual opportunities and drive revenue. 
So yes, we've partnered with UBC and other CROs, and that's a dimensional aspect of, I think, how we validated our capabilities. But I think we're excited about what we can do with the business as constituted in 2021. And  I think to Marc's point, look at other opportunities for inorganic acquisition and further growth in this space as we play forward our strategy."

But as Travis mentioned, and I invite him to comment further, we're not walking away from our existing client base. They are a critical component to our future success. So we're going to have a reinvigorated strategy around them. And it's going to be on Travis' watch.

I mean 1 is we've talked about it, but our core clients are important, I mean, the heart and soul of Cerner in a lot of ways, they've been with us a long time. It's really important for us because we do well when our clients are current, and we're investing and we're working with them to keep them current. It gives us opportunity to extend those agreements, but it also gives us white space to expand with new solution capabilities. So it's very important that we focus there. 
The federal business, I've had the pleasure of leading that business for the last 6 years. I think we have continued solid opportunity there. I think we have opportunity beyond our core contracts. I see potential for us with new agency work. I see potential with the work that we're doing in strategic growth to go do work with them on the network side. And so I do think federal continues to be an opportunity for us. And I think we'll become more and more efficient in that business as time goes by, particularly in how we deliver service, how we behave as a prime contractor and also probably the use of third-party resources. 
And then I've mentioned the amplification of strategic growth multiple times, but I think that as we develop those capabilities, we have the opportunity to take them into our client base and our markets in really an aggressive and strategic way. And I think that gives us opportunity to have the right line of business mix as well as we push forward. And then M&A is an enabling strategy. I don't know. For me, it has to support the core strategy, and we're doing that, and we're putting our capital to use. So I think those 4 or 5 key areas will be our focus for go to market, and then ensuring that we deliver on an end-to-end service basis in the most efficient way possible, also have a pretty extensive delivery background on the services side, so we'll be focused on proper delivery."

Certainly, our activity on the M&A side could impact that somewhat, and we're going to apply our capital in the best way possible. But I think from a margin expansion view, certainly, our long-term view that we shared that remains in place is 100-plus bps of increase in margins every year. The midpoint of our guidance achieved more than that 100 bps. And it's going to come from a variety of places. 
I think a key thing to remember for the people that might be looking for why isn't there more margin expansion in this year? Going through 2020, we accelerated some of our savings opportunities and our cost optimization in order to deliver the results we were able to deliver on the earnings line for the year. So we pulled some things forward, which means we're still working, we still have additional opportunities. 
But those were kind of across expense lines, and some of them will hit in the gross margin line, too, from a cost perspective. So they'll be spread pretty much throughout. There isn't any 1 thing we're relying on particularly to drive it. Almost all of it is already in process. And is just really going and realizing the benefit that we began the process of driving in 2020."

I mean, it's listening to your clients and solving their problems every day, holding our folks accountable for results. It's really, I think, embracing our internal mission to transform. Some of the work that we're doing to better connect client needs to our product capabilities, I think, is absolutely critical for us as it relates to better service delivery to our core clients. And it's really -- it's absolutely focusing on what I call the say-do ratio. If you say it, you got to do it. 
And so those are things that are really relevant to our core clients. We have to make sure that we uplift those clients and we have them current. Our current clients stay with us, and so I think a real focus from us on that element is very important. It makes it easier for them to test to train. It makes it easier for us to use the data in a meaningful way. And so I think it's really back to executing in the right way on the basics and then covering them fully. Relationships matter. And we've got to cover those clients in a way that matters to them. And it's also important that they understand. 
And the point I was trying to make earlier, we're not abandoning the core. We're focused on that, while we continue to innovate, while we continue to develop capabilities and thought leadership, we're doing that on behalf of those core clients, and we want them to be on that journey with us. And so I think clean, crisp, clear messaging is really important for us as we -- as I call it, bring back the swagger with that group of clients, and they have to understand what we're doing and why and how we're bringing them along.

So making sure we've made that connection, those relationships, that execution is very solid, is key. 
And then just as we've laid out, the transformation work is critical because having standard ways of operating and making us effective operating at the scale is critical in finding deficiencies in the business that allow us to continue to invest in innovation. Those are really the keys in the midterm. So the primary emphasis is execution."

But that movement will kind of -- will occur over some period of time relative to our -- relative to the -- from a financial impact, there's -- it will vary a little bit. 
But for the most part, a lot of our business today is designed to -- we have a hosting business already. We have elements of recurring revenue that are similar to SaaS in a way. Certainly, as we start evolving and moving millennium more to a cloud, like there'll be a point at which you switch over to some SaaS accounting, which could have an impact on some of the implementation services and the timing of recognizing some of that revenue. But a lot of it is pretty consistent to what we have. 
The timing of it, as I said, for Millennium, it really is more of an evolution. There is more work to do there, more modernization of the platform. We're spending a lot of time on. And a lot of our resources are going into that modernization. So I'm pretty confident that by the end of my tenure, it will all be done. But given that's only about 30 days, that probably doesn't really count. But it is a process. 
And certainly, as that process continues, and we get a better view of milestones and waypoints, we'll be able to give you an update kind of on what the financial impact is. But once again, the business today operates, a lot of the elements of it are recurring in nature. So those would be similar to what you see in a SaaS model to a great extent."

The cloud technologies hold a significant value proposition for our clients around product and platform modernization. So government is the largest payer. It creates opportunities for them to think about regulatory and currency faster. And it creates opportunities for them to adopt functionality quicker. It allows them to think about reduction in total cost of ownership or redirection of dollars to things that they think will innovate and grow their business. 
So you can see that with HealtheIntent that the value proposition is front and center. CareAware has been great for us because it's really allowed us to work through, not just the technical components, but to Marc's point, also some of the nontechnical contractual and inside the 4 walls topics that have to be surfaced. And we're already making progress on Millennium in terms of high-value workflows oriented around the cloud, and we'll continue to be selective about how we progress that approach. And I think it will play into a narrative around value proposition for our core clients and enablement of a bunch of our strategic growth efforts, inclusive of the work of HealtheIntent."

And so those have been really good testing grounds for us to really ask the question, hey, what would it look like for us to use HealtheIntent and add leverage there. 
And fundamentally, what we see, [ Alan ], is they're working on the same problem set in many ways that our Millennium and non-Millennium provider clients are. They need a data foundation, they're thinking about network management, they're thinking about reporting, dashboarding and analytic capabilities, care coordination, care management, all tethered to payment model and associated with member engagement. 
So we don't have turnkey MVP capabilities in those space, but we're building it out and getting much closer to it.

So that's a little bit of what the mix of the business looks like. 
And then you're also right, which is, look, the opportunity set we see is around our provider clients associated with those RWE-related opportunities later stage, and so the Elligo assets allow us to really begin to think through those site activation strategies, particularly for the community hospitals and IDNs that are part of that enhanced data arrangement that Brent described and allow us to then begin to think about participating in those later stage and larger contract opportunities, much as we probe it out, both with DCRI, the Duke CRO and also in 2020 with UBC."

Thank you for joining us. Well, as we all know, we're now a year into the pandemic, and I personally, I remain so impressed by the resilience of our clients on the front lines and the efforts of our associates ar",1365,"Thanks, Allan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Well, as we all know, we're now a year into the pandemic, and I personally, I remain so impressed by the resilience of our clients on the front lines and the efforts of our associates around the world supporting them. And as we move past the worst of the pandemic, hopefully, in most regions, an increasing portion of our role in assisting clients has been related to vaccine distribution. Now we've helped over 175 organizations with our mass vaccination solution, allowing clients to deploy and track vaccinations, document and report reactions and communicate with patients. We've also continued supporting our community and in partnership with local providers and very proud to say we've now delivered over 90,000 COVID vaccinations as part of the Operations Safe initiative I mentioned on our last call, excuse me. 
As we've discussed throughout the year, the pandemic accelerated many trends in health care that Cerner has been actively monitoring and building out capabilities to support for years. Among these is that providers face increasing pressure on cost and revenue, heightened consumer expectation and shifts in care venues. We continue to believe that we're well positioned to help our clients navigate these challenges while also enabling them to deliver improved clinical outcomes. Now for example, our real-time health system offerings bring near real-time enterprise transparency to help health systems perform at their peak efficiency and streamline operations and improve care delivery. In addition, our health network capabilities enable our clients to coordinate care across multiple organizations regardless of the core EMR and help them optimize for either a fee-for-service or value-based payment model. 
Our enhanced consumer engagement solutions help providers meet the growing expectations by patients who are seamless digital experience. We also continue to demonstrate our ability to bring innovation to the provider workflow to save time and address the very real issue of physician burnout. An example of this is our current recently successful pilot of our AI-powered Chart Assist, which abstracts data from the patient's chart and helps ensure correct diagnosis and documentation. This replaces the process of having to do manual queries days after the patient has been seen to capture missing or often an incomplete diagnosis. 
In summary, our ability to provide data-driven insights to providers and patients is at the core of the value we are providing. As a result, our clients are increasingly seeing value in our industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize data so that meaningful insights can be gleaned. 
We're also excited about the opportunity to use insights from data to play a role in improving the safety, efficiency and efficacy of clinical research. Consistent with this, we took a major step towards this call with our recent acquisition of Kantar Health. And we're really pleased to welcome their highly experienced management team that brings a deep understanding of the needs of the pharmaceutical industry. We believe this is an important step as we partner with our network of provider clients and to fundamentally change the time and cost of clinical trials. 
I also wanted to comment on the information blocking rules that went into effect last month and the broader interoperability rules in the 21st Century CARES Act. As you know, we've been fully supportive of these rules, and we believe they are an important step toward the health care industry finally realizing the potential of broad digitization, which should lead to improved outcomes, lower cost and a better patient experience. 
Now up to this point, as you know, the industry has spent billions of dollars on a base level of digitization, but the absence of broad interoperability has limited the return on this investment. So as interoperability and secure access to data improves in the coming years, we expect our proven ability to drive insights from data and to push them to the right place at the right time will remain a key differentiator. 
Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our federal business. The Department of Defense continues to move at full speed ahead with deploying MHS Genesis, their Cerner-powered EHR. At the end of February, they went live at Naval Medical Center in San Diego, which was their largest and most complex go-live to date. And DoD officials said this was their smoothest go live since the program began. In late April, DoD went live with Wave Carson across 12 states, 2 time zones and more than double the number of DoD commands now live. 
Now moving to Veterans Affairs. As most of you know, VA Secretary Dennis McDonald recently launched a strategic review of the VA's EHRM program. While at the same time, making it clear he's committed to Cerner and the program. Now we believe this review is analogous to steps taken by the DoD during their initial go-live. We welcome and strongly support this review because it allows us to bring new VA leadership up to speed on both the successes and the challenges of the program to capture their input and move forward together as we continue providing seamless care for our nation's veterans. We expect to exit this review stronger and ready to push forward with deployments at additional sites this year. 
During the review, we expect impact on our results will largely be mitigated since work on the ground continues as we prepare for go-lives at future sites. However, the review could shave up to 1 point off our projected revenue growth this year versus what we had originally expected. 
Moving to our results. We had a solid first quarter. And as Mark will share, we now expect to deliver stronger earnings than our prior outlook despite slightly lower top line growth due to the VA strategic review. This is possible because we've sharpened our focus and are moving forward with a renewed sense of urgency to continue delivering value to our clients and shareholders. 
Specifically, we're going faster on efficiency initiatives already being actioned by our transformation office, continuing and broadening our product and business portfolio reviews and adjusting our organizational design to centralize key functions. These actions all have a common goal, and that's to tighten our strategic focus so we can more effectively deliver value to our clients while also contributing sustainable, long-term profitable growth to our shareholders. 
We'll hear Mark Erceg in a moment, but I'd like to say that in the 2 months he's been our CFO, he has just been invaluable in helping us identify additional opportunities to improve our business and has done a terrific job of providing enhanced management reporting that is enabling much better informed decisions, and we're delighted to have him as part of the Cerner family. 
I'd also like to comment on the recent passing of Linda Dielmann, a long-standing member of the Cerner Board. She spent 10 years on our board and was a trusted adviser to many on the leadership team and great, wise counsel provided to all of us, including me, especially as I joined the company. While there's no direct replacement for Linda as a person, we do have an open search and are actively seeking qualified candidates. And Linda is deeply missed by all of us. 
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to comment on news upon my expected departure. As noted in the press release, the Board and I have started a process to identify Cerner's next CEO. And once the Board has named a successor, I plan to serve as an adviser to ensure a smooth transition. It's been an honor to be part of Cerner these past 3 years. And I can tell you, I connected with Cerner's mission from the very beginning. And the dedication of our associates and clients just aspires me every day. And I'm proud that Cerner is in such a strong position and that we've made good progress towards improving our operating model and strengthening our leadership team. Because of this progress, I believe my successor will take the reins at a time when Cerner is poised to accelerate its impact on health care. Mark, I'll turn it over to you."

But first, I'd like to share some early observations from my first 2 months at Cerner. First, the people are incredible. Cerner associates are dedicated, passionate professionals who are fully committed to the cause, which is merging technology with health care to improve outcomes for those we serve and love. As Brent often says, Cerner is striving to bring the joy back to practicing medicine, and that is a mission I can proudly lend my full efforts against. 
Second, the business is fundamentally sound. Cerner provides real solutions to real problems. Cerner has deep technical know-how, unique capabilities and significant competitive advantages as well as an exceedingly strong balance sheet. 
Third, while Cerner does have the associates and the capabilities and has created significant value for clients and shareholders since its inception, there is a clear recognition that a lack of focus, and at times, suboptimal execution has caused revenue growth to slow and margins to compress, which in turn has resulted in bottom quartile total shareholder return versus our proxy peer set over the past several years. 
This understanding is what led the Board, Brent and the senior management team to initiate a series of actions to improve results. I believe the actions taken so far are a good start, and I'm excited to play a role in increasing the pace of change so Cerner can realize its full and considerable potential faster. We believe these actions will allow Cerner to help more people than ever before whilst also generating leadership levels of total shareholder return. So with that understanding and my sincere thanks to Brent and the Board for giving me the opportunity to be part of the team, let me move on to summarize our first quarter results. Please note that my commentary will focus on key points of emphasis since I have no intention of simply repeating information already contained within the press release. 
Overall, we had a solid quarter. Bookings were up 13% versus a year ago to $1.23 billion, and we ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.1 billion. While this is admittedly down 3% from a year ago, that was primarily due to the impact of divestitures. Revenue in the first quarter of $1.39 billion was down 2% compared to last year and included lower-than-anticipated software, technology resale and reimbursed travel. However, after adjusting for divestitures, our first quarter revenue grew roughly 2% year-over-year. 
Gross margin was up 140 basis points from a year ago to 83.4%, reflecting improved revenue mix due to lower levels of outsourcing, third-party services and reimbursed travel. And adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points from 19.4% last year to 21.4% this year. Adjusted operating margins benefited from our continued cost optimization efforts and divestitures. And to be fair, we also had some additional expense benefit related to COVID of approximately $10 million in areas such as facilities and travel. 
As Brent indicated, we are leaning into our operational improvement efforts. And based on my initial assessment, I believe mid-20% adjusted operating margins should be attainable by 2024 as per our pre-COVID commitments. To achieve this, we are moving faster on our existing road map of cost optimization and process improvement initiatives and adding additional initiatives, including a full review of where COVID ARA savings can be made permanent in areas such as facilities. We are also going deeper on our product portfolio review with an eye towards consolidating and focusing on items that create the most client value. 
Finally, we are significantly building up our internal management reporting capabilities to enhance decision-making and drive accountability. Importantly, these actions will enhance, not dilute our primary focus, which is delighting our clients and motivating and encouraging our associates to reach their full potential because we know that having fully engaged associates and satisfied clients is a clear recipe for marketplace success and strong shareholder return. 
To finish off the P&L, our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.76 a share. This was up 7% over last year due primarily to operating margin expansion. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.47 billion of cash and short-term investments and $1.84 billion of debt after drawing $500 million on our shelf agreement during the quarter. We did this at very attractive interest rates, placing $400 million of private placement 10-year debt at 2.59% and $100 million of 5-year debt at 2%. We did this to prefund the Kantar Health acquisition, which closed April 1 and to partially fund future stock repurchase efforts. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $450 million. After $76 million of capital expenditures and $83 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $291 million. 
As we move to capital allocation, let me take just a few seconds to share my views as it relates to cash and balance sheet management. First, as an unapologetic capitalist, let me state very clearly that whatever cash we have on our balance sheet belongs to our shareholders, and we are simply the stewards of those funds. As such, the first call on cash is managing and investing in the core business wisely behind high-return propositions. 
Second, we aim to provide a competitive dividend yield. Presently, our dividend payout ratio was approximately 28%, but I anticipate that trending up over the next several years to somewhere in the low 30s. 
Third, we will consider strategic acquisitions if and only if we believe they will enhance our competitive position in the marketplace, exceed our cost of capital, be accretive over time and create shareholder value. Finally, with any remaining excess cash or investment-grade debt capacity, we may look to opportunistically repurchase our own shares if we believe the stock is trading below its intrinsic value. 
So against that backdrop, we returned $417 million to shareholders during the first quarter, including $67 million in dividends and $350 million of share repurchases. And as noted in the earnings press release, our Board just recently approved a new repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $3.75 billion of shares through the end of 2023. With that new authorization in hand, we expect to repurchase up to $1.5 billion this year, up from our previous guidance of up to $1 billion. Importantly, we believe this level of activity will make better use of our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital for potential investments or acquisitions within the confines of a strong investment-grade balance sheet. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to grow organically by high single digits over Q2 of 2020. This is because while Q2 2020 included about $40 million of revenue from businesses that have since been divested, we expect Kantar Health to now contribute a similar offsetting amount. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, which is generally consistent with the growth implied by the previously provided dollarized range. But the recent VA assessment, which we fully support, and the associated review has likely cost us somewhere between 0.5 point and 1 full point of revenue growth this year as some deployment work get shifted out of fiscal '21. 
For EPS, we expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS growth of approximately 20% over Q2 of 2020, which you will recall included a large negative impact from COVID of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be over $3.20 per share, reflecting growth of at least 13% over last year. This compares to our prior range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, with the higher expected earnings being driven by additional margin expansion efforts and an increase in share repurchase, which collectively should more than offset any slight loss in revenue related to the VA assessment. 
For the second quarter and the full year, we are expecting a 21% tax rate. And as it relates to cash, we are expecting to generate about $900 million of free cash flow for the year, up from $857 million last year. 
So in summary, I'm very excited to be at Cerner. I think we have a tremendous opportunity to positively impact health care while also growing and creating significant shareholder value. We are acting with urgency to achieve this, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And so a lot of nice traction, as you described, for our EDW and advanced analytics capabilities, a lot of interest in healthy referrals and how you think about referral activities across your provider network. And we think, over time, a lot of traction around care management as they start taking elevated levels of first dollar risk.

So from an upside perspective, I think inside the 4 walls of the hospital, big focus on real-time hospital systems. As Brent talked about in his prepared remarks, that was a big part of surge response and economic recovery. So think about workforce management, staffing capabilities, communications, hospital operations. I think all of those areas have seen a lot of COVID-related traction and trend. I think the provider network space is absolutely a focus, both for fee-for-service and fee-for-value use cases. A lot of focus on consumer. We see a lot of traction and trend around our consumer offerings as folks try to think about what does it look like to engage the consumer outside the 4 walls of the hospital. So those have been areas that have continued to see traction and trend over the course of the last 4 quarters reflected by our booked revenue. I think there have been some places that have been disrupted by COVID. I think the post-acute space is one that obviously was massively impacted by prevalence data and fatality data. And so I think that was a space that was negatively impacted on a 4-quarter basis. I also think the workforce health space is one that we've talked about in the past. I think employer certainly thinking a lot about what it looks like to get the right mix of health and care strategies as they think about return to work and hybrid work strategies. But at the same time, there's been a lot of disruption around those workforce population. So those would be 2 that I think I would put more in the headwind or wildcard status relative to go forward."

I think unified communication strategy, sort of omnichannel communications capabilities as a way to reach the consumer has been a big area of emphasis and focus and where we're seeing a lot of booked revenue growth. And then finally, I think somewhat correlated to that, a lot of focus on CRM and relationship management strategies as folks think about coordination of care strategies across both traditional venues and nontraditional venues like the home. So those would be some particular areas of emphasis above and beyond things like televisits and telehealth, which have been a feature of a lot of discussions in previous calls around this topic."

Within those 400 products, we have 82 product groups specifically. And what you'll find within those 82 product groups is that the top 25 account for greater than 85% of our total product revenue. So that's just one example of where we're using better data to kind of penetrate and really understand the business at a more granular level.

We just had our Cerner Health Forum, where we had over 5,000 participants over several days doing education and other sessions with us. We think that's important in this environment to continue to provide good, solid communications to them and education. And then upgrades is another portion of that client uplift investment upgrades.

It seems like this is a market that there's a whole host of different entities that are focused on. So can you give us a little more sense as well on where Cerner will be better competitively positioned to win over time."

One, we're very happy with where we're at relative to the Kantar acquisition. We closed that acquisition on April 1, and we're very happy with the forward progress around it. Two, and I think importantly, relative to your point on competitive differentiation, we continue to make very good progress in terms of building out our learning health network to activate our provider base and participating in that strategy around life sciences and pharma. We have 61 members of the LHN now representing almost 30,000 beds. So we're ahead of KPI targets relative to approach on the LHN side. I guess just the final thing I would say is I look at what's going on with Truvada and other EMR players who have acquired their way into this space. And I see it as very validating of the overall thesis around our opportunity to organize 1/3 of provider health care and create unique opportunities for them around life sciences and pharma. So I see that competitive landscape as validating a thesis, and now we need to execute well with the strategic differentiation that I think we do have, and that's playing out. 
I guess just one more thing I would say. You heard Travis talk about opportunities around data more broadly defined. I think we're very focused on the life sciences and pharma strategy, but there's multiple data strategies that I think represent themselves, including some interesting opportunities in the federal space beyond what we're doing with the VA and DoD. So look for us to continue to think about how to put data to work and to monetize it in a way that has, to Mark's point, attractive margin profiles around it."

I mean we're very pleased, as Brent noted in his comments, with the  operational and the execution progress on DoD and Coast Guard. So thanks for noting that. That's been a successful rollout for us as well. So we're moving forward at speed and at scale with DoD. The Carson go live was 12 states, 10,000 users on a single day. That's a major accomplishment. VA, we support the strategic assessment. That's not being done in a vacuum. We're working together with VA daily on that. And so we feel that we'll come out in a great place with them in the new administration on a strengthened schedule and focus around it. And so in terms of our core on-contract opportunities, we feel very good about the progress we're making and our ability to deliver our promises and requirements. 
As it relates to growing the federal business and where we see that, our strategy has been the same. Number one, it's delivering on our promises and continuing on contract growth. We've got a multibillion dollar opportunity on our IDIQ with VA and DoD, and that hinges on our keeping our commitments and promises. We've got new requirements, white space and new opportunities. With the DoD, we've got opportunity with HealtheIntent. We've got opportunity with solutions that we've been discussing this morning that hang off of that platform, that aggregation layer, and we're in active conversations with them. So I see us having good possibilities there. TRICARE remains a great opportunity for us in the value-based care space. I think that we're well positioned with our platform, with our data aggregation capabilities to be a material to provide a longitudinal record and bring those clinical and payer data sets together for them and we're material in that conversation. And then ultimately, there are still new footprint opportunities. Indian Health Services is one of the last remaining vestiges of the Vista system, we'll likely make a decision. And then we did sign an opportunity in our first quarter with CDC around real-world data that I believe Don mentioned. And so we've got a rich data set, as you can imagine. And so CDC and others are active and interested in that. So we do view data as an opportunity for us on a go-forward basis. So I think we've got multiple threads of opportunity with thorough business."

So are we -- are all the things we set out to do 3 years ago the things we set out to do today, and we're working through that and we're making progress. And I think we'll be doing strength of schedule evaluation. So we'll be looking at the full schedule. It's not lost on anyone that we've actually been able to accelerate our DoD rollout in the out years once we've been able to harden the solution set. So I think that we can look at the schedule holistically. We think we're in a good position to possibly accelerate the rollout in the years 5 through 7. But in the short term, it will cause some wave activity to push to the right as we're undergoing the 12-week assessment. And I think Mark noted that in his comments. But ultimately, again, I just believe that we'll come out with a codified schedule with them, clear KPIs that we're going to hold ourselves accountable to and a clear focus collectively with the new administration and leadership. So I think that's the direction that we're going with some short-term headwinds, long-term tailwind potentially."

We'll need to make sure that we balance that and that we do it in a way that is representative of our deliverables to our shareholders themselves. One could argue that over the last several years, when our TSR hasn't really performed, that maybe we were a little bit too generous in that regard because we are clearly a pay-for-performance company.

So they're figuring out how to manage supply-demand dynamics around that provider network as they recover from COVID. But it also begins to really help them understand what would it look like for me to take elevated rates of first dollar risk as part of a value strategy. And so what we're excited about in the provider network space is the chance to help our provider clients navigate that transition, maximize fee-for-service, but also begin to prepare for shifts in payment. And then just the last thing I would say is that the big opportunity from a growth perspective that Travis and I think and talk about every day is -- Mark's right, we do have an enviable position with 1/3 of U.S. provider organizations.

Thank you for joining us. Well, as we all know, we're now a year into the pandemic, and I personally, I remain so impressed by the resilience of our clients on the front lines and the efforts of our associates around the world supporting them. And as we move past the worst of the pandemic, hopefully, in most regions, an increasing portion of our role in assisting clients has been related to vaccine distribution. 
Now we've helped over 175 organizations with our mass vaccination solution, allowing clients to deploy and track vaccinations, document and report reactions and communicate with patients. We've also continued supporting our community and in partnership with local providers and very proud to say we've now delivered over 90,000 COVID vaccinations as part of the Operation Safe initiative I mentioned on our last call.
As we've discussed throughout the year, the pandemic accelerated many trends in health care that Cerner has been actively monitoring and building out capabilities to support for years. Among these, is that providers face increasing pressure on cost and revenue, heightened consumer expectation and shifts in care venues. 
We continue to believe that we're well positioned to help our clients navigate these challenges while also enabling them to deliver improved clinical outcomes. Now for example, our real-time health system offerings bring near real-time enterprise transparency to help health systems perform at their peak efficiency and streamline operations and improve care delivery. 
In addition, our health network capabilities enable our clients to coordinate care across multiple organizations regardless of the core EMR and help them optimize for either a fee-for-service or value-based payment model.  
Our enhanced consumer engagement solutions help providers meet the growing expectations by patients who are seamless digital experience. We also continue to demonstrate our ability to bring innovation to the provider workflow to save time and address the very real issue of physician burnout. An example of this is our current -- recently successful pilot of our AI-powered Chart Assist, which abstracts data from the patient's chart and helps ensure correct diagnosis and documentation. This replaces the process of having to do manual queries, days after the patient has been seen to capture missing or often an incomplete diagnosis.  
In summary, our ability to provide data-driven insights to providers and patients is at the core of the value we are providing. As a result, our clients are increasingly seeing value in our industry-leading ability to aggregate and normalize data so that meaningful insights can be gleaned. 
We're also excited about the opportunity to use insights from data to play a role in improving the safety, efficiency and efficacy of clinical research. Consistent with this, we took a major step towards this call with our recent acquisition of Kantar Health. And we're really pleased to welcome their highly experienced management team that brings that deep understanding of the needs of the pharmaceutical industry. We believe this is an important step as we partner with our network of provider clients and to fundamentally change the time and cost of clinical trials.  
I also wanted to comment on the information blocking rules that went into effect last month and the broader interoperability rules in the 21st Century CARES Act. As you know, we've been fully supportive of these rules, and we believe they are an important step toward the health care industry finally realizing the potential of broad digitization, which should lead to improved outcomes lower cost and a better patient experience.  
Now up to this point, as you know, the industry has spent billions of dollars on a base level of digitization, but the absence of broad interoperability has limited the return on this investment. So as interoperability and secure access to data improves in the coming years, we expect our proven ability to drive insights from data and to push them to the right place at the right time will remain a key differentiator.  
Now I'd like to provide a quick update on our federal business. The Department of Defense continues to move at full speed ahead with deploying MHS GENESIS, their Cerner-powered EHR. At the end of February, they went live at Naval Medical Center in San Diego, which was their largest and most complex go-live to date. And DoD officials said this was their smoothest go-live since the program began. In late April, DoD went live with Wave Carson across 12 states, 2 time zones and more than doubled the number of DoD commands now live.  
Now moving to Veterans Affairs. As most of you know, VA Secretary Dennis McDonough recently launched a strategic review of the VA's EHRM program. While at the same time, making it clear he's committed to Cerner and the program. Now, we believe this review is analogous to steps taken by the DoD during their initial go-live. We welcome and strongly support this review because it allows us to bring new VA leadership up to speed on both the successes and the challenges of the program to capture their input and move forward together as we continue providing seamless care for our nation's veterans. We expect to exit this review stronger and ready to push forward with deployments at additional sites this year.  
During the review, we expect impact on our results will largely be mitigated since work on the ground continues as we prepare for go-lives at future sites. However, the review could shave up to 1 point off our projected revenue growth this year versus what we had originally expected. 
Moving to our results. We had a solid first quarter. And as Mark will share, we now expect to deliver stronger earnings than our prior outlook despite slightly lower top line growth due to the VA strategic review. This is possible because we've sharpened our focus and are moving forward with a renewed sense of urgency to continue delivering value to our clients and shareholders. 
Specifically, we're going faster on efficiency initiatives already being actioned by our transformation office, continuing and broadening our product and business portfolio reviews and adjusting our organizational design to centralize key functions. These actions all have a common goal, and that's to tighten our strategic focus so we can more effectively deliver value to our clients while also contributing sustainable, long-term profitable growth to our shareholders.  
We'll hear Mark Erceg speak in a moment, but I'd like to say that in the 2 months he's been our CFO, he has just been invaluable in helping us identify additional opportunities to improve our business and has done a terrific job of providing enhanced management reporting that is enabling much better informed decisions, and we're delighted to have him as part of the Cerner family.  
I'd also like to comment on the recent passing of Linda M. Dillman, a long-standing member of the Cerner Board. She spent 10 years on our board and was a trusted adviser to many on the leadership team and great, wise counsel provided to all of us, including me, especially as I joined the company. While there's no direct replacement for Linda as a person, we do have an open search and are actively seeking qualified candidates. And Linda is deeply missed by all of us.  
Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to comment on news upon my expected departure. As noted in the press release, the Board and I have started a process to identify Cerner's next CEO. And once the Board has named a successor, I plan to serve as an adviser to ensure a smooth transition. It's been an honor to be part of Cerner these past 3 years. And I can tell you, I connected with Cerner's mission from the very beginning. And the dedication of our associates and clients just aspires me every day. And I'm proud that Cerner is in such a strong position and that we've made good progress towards improving our operating model and strengthening our leadership team. Because of this progress, I believe my successor will take the reins at a time when Cerner is poised to accelerate its impact on health care. Mark, I'll turn it over to you."

Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter results and provide a guidance update. But first, I'd like to share some early observations from my first 2 months at Cerner. First, the people are incredible. Cerner associates are dedicated, passionate professionals who are fully committed to the cause, which is merging technology with health care to improve outcomes for those we serve and love. As Brent often says, Cerner is striving to bring the joy back to practicing medicine, and that is a mission I can proudly lend my full efforts against.  
Second, the business is fundamentally sound. Cerner provides real solutions to real problems. Cerner has deep technical know-how, unique capabilities and significant competitive advantages as well as an exceedingly strong balance sheet.  
Third, while Cerner does have the associates and the capabilities and has created significant value for clients and shareholders since its inception, there is a clear recognition that a lack of focus, and at times, suboptimal execution has caused revenue growth to slow and margins to compress, which in turn has resulted in bottom quartile total shareholder return versus our proxy peer set over the past several years. 
This understanding is what led the Board, Brent and the senior management team to initiate a series of actions to improve results. I believe the actions taken so far are a good start, and I'm excited to play a role in increasing the pace of change so Cerner can realize its full and considerable potential faster. We believe these actions will allow Cerner to help more people than ever before whilst also generating leadership levels of total shareholder return. 
So with that understanding and my sincere thanks to Brent and the Board for giving me the opportunity to be part of the team, let me move on to summarize our first quarter results. Please note that my commentary will focus on key points of emphasis since I have no intention of simply repeating information already contained within the press release.  
Overall, we had a solid quarter. Bookings were up 13% versus a year ago to $1.23 billion, and we ended the quarter with a revenue backlog of $13.1 billion. While this is admittedly down 3% from a year ago, that was primarily due to the impact of divestitures. Revenue in the first quarter of $1.39 billion was down 2% compared to last year and included lower-than-anticipated software, technology resale and reimbursed travel. However, after adjusting for divestitures, our first quarter revenue grew roughly 2% year-over-year.  
Gross margin was up 140 basis points from a year ago to 83.4%, reflecting improved revenue mix due to lower levels of outsourcing, third-party services and reimbursed travel and adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points from 19.4% last year to 21.4% this year. Adjusted operating margins benefited from our continued cost optimization efforts and divestitures. And to be fair, we also had some additional expense benefit related to COVID of approximately $10 million in areas such as facilities and travel.  
As Brent indicated, we are leaning into our operational improvement efforts. And based on my initial assessment, I believe mid-20% adjusted operating margins should be attainable by 2024 as per our pre-COVID commitments. To achieve this, we are moving faster on our existing road map of cost optimization and process improvement initiatives and adding additional initiatives, including a full review of where COVID era savings can be made permanent in areas such as facilities. We are also going deeper on our product portfolio review with an eye towards consolidating and focusing on items that create the most client value.  
Finally, we are significantly building up our internal management reporting capabilities to enhance decision-making and drive accountability. Importantly, these actions will enhance, not dilute our primary focus, which is delighting our clients and motivating and encouraging our associates to reach their full potential because we know that having fully engaged associates and satisfied clients is a clear recipe for marketplace success and strong shareholder return.  
To finish off the P&L, our tax rate was 21% for the quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.76 a share. This was up 7% over last year due primarily to operating margin expansion.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $1.47 billion of cash and short-term investments and $1.84 billion of debt after drawing $500 million on our shelf agreement during the quarter. We did this at very attractive interest rates, placing $400 million of private placement 10-year debt at 2.59% and $100 million of 5-year debt at 2%. We did this to prefund the Kantar Health acquisition, which closed April 1 and to partially fund future stock repurchase efforts.  
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $450 million. After $76 million of capital expenditures and $83 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $291 million.  
As we move to capital allocation, let me take just a few seconds to share my views as it relates to cash and balance sheet management. First, as an unapologetic capitalist, let me state very clearly that whatever cash we have on our balance sheet belongs to our shareholders, and we are simply the stewards of those funds. As such, the first call on cash is managing and investing in the core business wisely behind high-return propositions.  
Second, we aim to provide a competitive dividend yield. Presently, our dividend payout ratio was approximately 28%, but I anticipate that trending up over the next several years to somewhere in the low 30s.  
Third, we will consider strategic acquisitions if and only if we believe they will enhance our competitive position in the marketplace, exceed our cost of capital be accretive over time and create shareholder value. Finally, with any remaining excess cash or investment-grade debt capacity, we may look to opportunistically repurchase our own shares if we believe the stock is trading below its intrinsic value.  
So against that backdrop, we returned $417 million to shareholders during the first quarter, including $67 million in dividends and $350 million of share repurchases. And as noted in the earnings press release, our Board just recently approved a new repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $3.75 billion of shares through the end of 2023. 
With that new authorization in hand, we expect to repurchase up to $1.5 billion this year, up from our previous guidance of up to $1 billion. Importantly, we believe this level of activity will make better use of our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital for potential investments or acquisitions within the confines of a strong investment-grade balance sheet. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to grow organically by high single digits over Q2 of 2020. This is because while Q2 2020 included about $40 million of revenue from businesses that have since been divested, we expect Kantar Health to now contribute a similar offsetting amount. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, which is generally consistent with the growth implied by the previously provided dollarized range. But the recent VA assessment, which we fully support, and the associated review has likely cost us somewhere between 0.5 point and 1 full point of revenue growth this year as some deployment work get shifted out of fiscal '21. 
For EPS, we expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS growth of approximately 20% over Q2 of 2020, which you will recall included a large negative impact from COVID of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be over $3.20 per share, reflecting growth of at least 13% over last year. This compares to our prior range of $3.10 to $3.20 per share, with the higher expected earnings being driven by additional margin expansion efforts and an increase in share repurchase, which collectively should more than offset any slight loss in revenue related to the VA assessment. 
For the second quarter and the full year, we are expecting a 21% tax rate. And as it relates to cash, we are expecting to generate about $900 million of free cash flow for the year, up from $857 million last year. 
So in summary, I'm very excited to be at Cerner. I think we have a tremendous opportunity to positively impact health care while also growing and creating significant shareholder value. We are acting with urgency to achieve this, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

And so a lot of nice traction, as you just described, for our EDW and advanced analytics capabilities, a lot of interest in healthy referrals and how you think about referral activities across your provider network. And we think, over time, a lot of traction around care management as they start taking elevated levels of first dollar risk.

So from an upside perspective, I think inside the 4 walls of the hospital, big focus on real-time hospital systems. As Brent talked about in his prepared remarks, that was a big part of surge response and economic recovery. 
So think about workforce management, staffing capabilities, communications, hospital operations. I think all of those areas have seen a lot of COVID-related traction and trend. I think the provider network space is absolutely a focus, both for fee-for-service and fee-for-value use cases. A lot of focus on consumer. We see a lot of traction and trend around our consumer offerings as folks try to think about what does it look like to engage the consumer outside the 4 walls of the hospital. 
So those have been areas that have continued to see traction and trend over the course of the last 4 quarters reflected by our booked revenue. I think there have been some places that have been disrupted by COVID. I think the post-acute space is one that obviously was massively impacted by prevalence data and fatality data. 
And so I think that was a space that was negatively impacted on a 4-quarter basis. I also think the workforce health space is one that we've talked about in the past. I think employer certainly thinking a lot about what it looks like to get the right mix of health and care strategies as they think about return to work and hybrid work strategies. But at the same time, there's been a lot of disruption around those workforce population. So those would be 2 that I think I would put more in the headwind or wildcard status relative to go forward."

So that's been a big emphasis. I think unified communication strategy, sort of omnichannel communications capabilities as a way to reach the consumer has been a big area of emphasis and focus and where we're seeing a lot of booked revenue growth. 
And then finally, I think somewhat correlated to that, a lot of focus on CRM and relationship management strategies as folks think about coordination of care strategies across both traditional venues and nontraditional venues like the home. So those would be some particular areas of emphasis above and beyond things like televisits and telehealth, which have been a feature of a lot of discussions in previous calls around this topic."

So for example, we talked about the fact that we're putting better management reporting capability sets in place. That's allowing us to really unpack the business in ways at hitherto we haven't had the access to really have visibility through and see. 
So for example, you've heard us talk in the past about how we have 25,000 features, which we've recently pounded down into 400 different products. Within those 400 products, we have 82 product groups specifically. And what you'll find within those 82 product groups is that the top 25 account for greater than 85% of our total product revenue. 
So that's just one example of where we're using better data to kind of penetrate and really understand the business at a more granular level.

We talked about the last, last time around, we're focused very heavily in our core market. And we're very intentional in our client uplift programming. So we've got a number of programs going there as we talked about. We're working through what we call blueprints, where we're looking at clinical capabilities and efficiencies with our clients. 
We've got targeted investments in certain solution areas, pediatrics and others that we think are very impactful. We're working closely with clients. We just had our Cerner Health Forum, where we had over 5,000 participants over several days doing education and other sessions with us. We think that's important in this environment to continue to provide good, solid communications to them and education. 
And then upgrades is another portion of that client uplift investment upgrades. What I would say about it is that it's a -- it's not keeping clients current and committed is not one thing. It's a holistic strategic approach. And so we're approaching it from multiple angles. I can't give an exact number of the percentage of our clients. But what I can tell you is that we're hitting the vast majority of our clients with -- in some capacity with one of those approaches strategies or tools in order to make sure we cover the entirety of our client base versus having 1 focus, 1 program that takes us a much longer time to roll out. 
So I think the comprehensive nature of what we're doing, our approach is, I think, it's accelerating our speed to value for our clients and keeping them current relevant and I'll just make one other note. We've talked about client current, but from my perspective, protection, defending the environment base is not our goal. Our goal is to provide for our clients. And as Don noted prior, I'm very encouraged that we're on strategy based on the conversations on having with our clients globally, federally and in the U.S. client market. 
The conversations are trending very much into the things that we're working on and we've been a leader, and we've been ahead of in the industry for a number of decades. So I think we're in a good place in terms of getting our clients current being competitive and also as it relates to forward-looking market trends accelerated by the COVID pandemic."

One, we're very happy with where we're at relative to the Kantar acquisition. We closed that acquisition on April 1, and we're very happy with the forward progress around it. Two, and I think importantly, relative to your point on competitive differentiation, we continue to make very good progress in terms of building out our learning health network to activate our provider base and participating in that strategy around life sciences and pharma. We have 61 members of the LHN now representing almost 30,000 beds. 
So we're ahead of KPI targets relative to approach on the LHN side. I guess just the final thing I would say is, I look at what's going on with Truvada and other EMR players who have acquired their way into this space. And I see it as very validating of the overall thesis around our opportunity to organize 1/3 of provider health care and create unique opportunities for them around life sciences and pharma. 
So I see that competitive landscape as validating a thesis, and now we need to execute well with the strategic differentiation that I think we do have, and that's playing out. 
I guess just one more thing I would say. You heard Travis talk about opportunities around data more broadly defined. I think we're very focused on the life sciences and pharma strategy, but there's multiple data strategies that I think represent themselves, including some interesting opportunities in the federal space beyond what we're doing with the VA and DoD. So look for us to continue to think about how to put data to work and to monetize it in a way that has, to Mark's point, attractive margin profiles around it."

And so we feel that we'll come out in a great place with them in the new administration on a strengthened schedule and focus around it. And so in terms of our core on-contract opportunities, we feel very good about the progress we're making and our ability to deliver our promises and requirements. 
As it relates to growing the federal business and where we see that, our strategy has been the same. Number one, it's delivering on our promises and continuing on contract growth. We've got a multibillion dollar opportunity on our IDIQ with VA and DoD, and that hinges on our -- keeping our commitments and promises. We've got new requirements, white space and new opportunities with the DoD, we've got opportunity with HealtheIntent. We've got opportunity with solutions that we've been discussing this morning that hang off of that platform, that aggregation layer, and we're in active conversations with them. 
So I see us having good possibilities there. TRICARE remains a great opportunity for us in the value-based care space. I think that we're well positioned with our platform, with our data aggregation capabilities to be a material to provide a longitudinal record and bring those clinical and pair of data sets together for them and we're material in that conversation. 
And then ultimately, there are still new footprint opportunities. Indian Health Services is one of the last remaining vestiges of the VisTa system, we'll likely make a decision. 
And then we did sign an opportunity in our first quarter with CDC around real-world data that I believe Don mentioned. And so we've got a rich data set, as you can imagine. And so CDC and others are active and interested in that. So we do view data as an opportunity for us on a go-forward basis. So I think we've got multiple threads of opportunity with thorough business."

One is, again, looking at and evaluating the contract. So are we -- are all the things we set out to do 3 years ago the things we set out to do today, and we're working through that and we're making progress. And I think we'll be doing strength of schedule evaluation. So we'll be looking at the full schedule. It's not lost on anyone that we've actually been able to accelerate our DoD rollout in the out years once we've been able to harden the solution set. 
So I think that we can look at the schedule holistically. We think we're in a good position to possibly accelerate the rollout in the years 5 through 7. But in the short term, it will cause some wave activity to push to the right as we're undergoing the 12-week assessment. And I think Mark noted that in his comments. But ultimately, again, I just believe that we'll come out with a codified schedule with them, clear KPIs that we're going to hold ourselves accountable to and a clear focus collectively with the new administration and leadership. So I think that's the direction that we're going with some short-term headwinds, long-term tailwind potentially."

Second, I guess what I would say is I think we have all the tools here to be very, very successful in the years ahead. We have nearly 3 million health care providers use Cerner systems each and every day. We have 25,000 associates who have an unparalleled and unmatched knowledge of the health care and IT intersection. We're the top provider of IT to the federal government. We lead the acute EMR global market with 2,400 inpatient facilities worldwide. We have a strong balance sheet. We have 600 patents. We have $800 million a year. We invest in R&D. I mean we have all the tools, and we have the team. right? 
So I think we're going to be able to do considerably better vis-a-vis our shareholders in the years ahead because there's a clear acknowledgment that on the CSR front, we haven't necessarily always delivered.

Look, we're an IT company.

We'll need to make sure that we balance that and that we do it in a way that is representative of our deliverables to our shareholders themselves. 
One could argue that over the last several years, when our TSR hasn't really performed, that maybe we were a little bit too generous in that regard because we are clearly a pay-for-performance company. And the Compensation Committee and the Board has made it clear that they're going to hold the management team accountable for performance in the years ahead.

So that's certainly going to be a part of how we think about putting capital to work at a broad level. And then at a micro level relative to healthy referrals, look, it's a great use case around what's playing out from a provider network perspective, it's an opportunity for our clients to really think about how they manage referrals for key service line areas, CV, oncology, neuro orthopedics. 
So they're figuring out how to manage supply-demand dynamics around that provider network as they recover from COVID. But it also begins to really help them understand what would it look like for me to take elevated rates of first dollar risk as part of a value strategy. And so what we're excited about in the provider network space is the chance to help our provider clients navigate that transition, maximize fee-for-service, but also begin to prepare for shifts in payment. 
And then just the last thing I would say is that the big opportunity from a growth perspective that Travis and I think and talk about every day is -- Mark's right, we do have an enviable position with 1/3 of U.S. provider organizations. But there's a huge addressable market for us outside the scope of our Cerner Millennium base.

But in a lot of ways, our systems and our ways of operating were not really conducive to speed. They've been built up over time. And at this scale, we're not very efficient. So it sounds kind of mechanical, but there's been a fair amount of time getting an operating model in place that's clear, that is understandable, accountability is deployed throughout the organization. 
And so the intent to move is pretty clear. The ability to move quickly requires organization alignment and great execution. And so I think we have -- we are in a much stronger position to do that today and are ready to do that and have a leadership team ready to move that forward. So I think the stage has been set. And the direction is clear and the ability to accelerate now is in front of us. 
So on your second question about talent, yes, there's definitely a global war for talent in tech, and we all know that. So we are doing everything we can to make sure that we're an attractive employer for our associates that this is a place that you can come and not only contribute to technology, but you can make a difference in the world because it's health care. 
And that's somewhat unique. And a lot of the other places intact here may not be that bold charter. But that is our mission. And I think for -- especially technical talent that wants to be part of changing the world, making a difference. This is a great fit. And so we're very much interested in getting that worried about us as an employer, and we're proud of some of the progress in our culture over the last year and some of the things our associates have done to make a difference during COVID and to make a difference in the community. So But it's a competitive landscape for sure."

On our last call, we talked about our sharpened focus and increased sense of urgency to deliver value to our clients and shareholders. And as Mark will discuss, this increased focus and urgency helped us deliver very solid results in the second quarter. 
All key metrics reflected good progress on our transformation initiatives and a strengthening market presence. And based on this progress, we have increased our earnings outlook for the year again. What pleases me most is that as we undergo our transformation, we're maintaining an unwavering focus on client success, which is truly our North Star. 
Our key initiatives, which include product rationalization, driving operating efficiencies and continuing to refine our operating structure, all revolve around creating client value through accelerated innovation. And we expect these same efforts to also drive sustainable and profitable growth that should create value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to share some examples of progress we're making. Through improved focus and structure in our client organization, Travis and his team have grown our sales funnel and improved sales and client relationship management resulting in 24 new client footprints so far this year while reducing client attrition. 
We've also improved our overall Net Promoter Score by 5 points and have delivered 49 major client go-lives. Don and his team have made meaningful progress on several fronts as well, including advancing our product rationalization work which is creating better focus and freeing investment dollars for products that create the most value for clients and driving good sales and go-live activity in key areas such as real-time health, behavioral health, consumer, health network and data, which the progress -- with the progress in data space, including a successful onboarding of Kantar Health during the second quarter. 
Now in our technology organization, Jerome Labat, who is our CTO, has made good progress on solution and platform modernization, including being ahead of schedule on migrating care wear to the cloud. also improving our ambulatory solution and increasing the scale of CommunityWorks, all while maintaining 99.99% or 49% of incident free time for our clients. He's also advanced our digital factory, which is a set of capabilities and services that power the product life cycle from initial requirements to building, delivering and running our products. 
This important work should drive R&D efficiencies, improve quality, increase innovation velocity and speed to market and lower cost of running and supporting our products. These leaders have made this progress while also delivering cost savings through restructuring and flattening their organizations, centralizing functions and also implementing tools to increase efficiency and improve the way we are running our business. And further, Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resources Officer, has helped us navigate these changes while staying focused on culture and ensuring Cerner remains a great place to work. 
Now this is reflected in being named one of the world's best employers by Forbes. And we've also just recently received recognition by Forbes as 1 of the top 60 best employers for diversity. And also for being among the best employers for women. In summary, we continue to make very good progress, both inside Cerner and in the marketplace. Our products and services are well aligned with our clients' needs as they face pressure to control operating costs, address provider burnout, meet increasing consumer demands, expand service lines and also to build networks to improve performance in the evolving reimbursement environment. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. The Department of Defence continues to move at full speed with deploying MHS GENESIS, their Cerner-powered EHR. In late April, DoD went live with Wave Carson, which included 25 military treatment commands, 148 physical locations across 11 states and 2 time zones. In total, the DoD is now live at 42 commands, 663 locations with more than 41,000 activated users, demonstrating that the system can be deployed at scale and on schedule. And later this year, DoD plans to go live at facilities in Hawaii and the U.S. Coast Guard has planned go-lives for both their Pacific and Atlantic ways, which will complete the Coast Card deployment as planned. 
Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA recently completed their strategic review, which we strongly supported and issued a comprehensive report. And importantly, these fines were generally not technology-related. Instead, they were more focused on governance, training and site readiness. And we're consistent -- highly consistent with the findings of our own internal assessment conducted earlier this year. 
We're working very closely with the VA on the project plan and ensuring we properly address all identified issues so we can deliver a time -- a lifetime of seamless care for our veterans. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dennis McDonough has reiterated his commitment to the program and to Cerner. And in return, Cerner has reiterated our commitment to the VA and our nation's veterans. And while the VA finalizes their new governance and management structure, we will continue to our predeployment efforts, including technical development and enhancements, solution readiness and site preparation, but no further go lives are expected until 2022. And as a result, we now expect another 0.5 point of impact on our 2021 revenue growth, which is reflected in our updated guidance for the year. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to quickly comment on the status of my transition and the search for a new CEO. The search process has been very active since we announced it last quarter. And as you can imagine, it is difficult to provide an exact time line given the sensitivity and importance of the search, but I believe the Board is making very good progress. I personally remain actively engaged and believe the team has been executing very well. So I'm confident we will continue to advance our key initiatives as the search continues. And as a result, I believe my successor will step into the role with Cerner well positioned for success. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with Cerner's progress so far this year. We have demonstrated the ability to execute on near-term deliverables while also driving meaningful organizational change that is positioning Cerner to realize our potential and to have a much bigger impact on health care. Mark, I'll turn it over to you."

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results.

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Bookings were up 2% versus a year ago to $1.36 billion, which brings year-to-date bookings growth to 7%. Importantly, we believe this represents a positive inflection point since total bookings were down during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. 
The higher rate of bookings added to our revenue backlog, which ended the second quarter at $13.2 billion, which is 1% up sequentially and down slightly versus a year ago, due primarily to divestitures. Revenue of $1.46 billion was up 10% over the year ago quarter, which was admittedly heavily impacted by COVID. The increase in revenue was driven in large part due to strong growth in federal services. 
In addition, it is worth noting that virtually all of the growth we experienced during the second quarter was organic, with $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition being largely offset by $39 million of divested revenue. 
Gross margin was down 200 basis points from a year ago at 82.1% primarily due to the mix of revenue in the quarter. specifically, higher levels of lower-margin technology resale, third-party services and reimbursed travel. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 220 basis points from 18.4% to 20.6%, driven primarily by tight expense control and a negatively impacted year-ago margin due to COVID. 
Now to build on this progress, we took bold action across our largest spend pools during the second quarter. For example, we incurred $54 million of employee separation costs due to a sizable reduction in force related to productivity improvements we recently implemented. We also incurred a charge of $68 million to reduce the properties line on our balance sheet to fair value in connection with the sale of 1 property and the designation of 2 other properties as held for sale. Since the start of the year, we have sold 260,000 square feet of office space and have earmarked an additional 750,000 square feet of space for future sale. Lastly, we recorded a charge of $48 million to reduce the carrying amount of certain capitalized software development costs to estimated net realizable value as part of our comprehensive product portfolio rationalization work, which is designed to improve over time, the return on our nearly $800 million annual R&D investment. Each of these actions and the related charges are captured in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. These actions are also consistent with our previously communicated efforts to operate more efficiently, drive more value for clients and better position Cerner for sustainable, long-term profitable growth. 
Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.80 per share, which is up 27% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower non-GAAP tax rate and a lower share count. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $885 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $1.47 billion last quarter. There are 2 things that account for the change: first, we used $350 million to close on the Kantar Health acquisition; second, we spent $400 million on share repurchases during the quarter, which brings our purchases through the end of the second quarter up to $750 million. 
We have been using a large portion of our excess cash and short-term investments throughout the year to repurchase shares because we continue to believe that Cerner stock at current trading levels represents a good return on investment for our shareholders. Sequentially, our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q1 at $1.84 billion. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $369 million. After $123 million of capital expenditures and $84 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $162 million. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $453 million, which is more than double the amount we generated during the same period last year. The significant increase in year-to-date free cash flow was driven by strong operating cash flow growth against a COVID impacted first half of 2020. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to grow approximately 6% compared to Q3 of 2020. This includes just over $40 million of revenue from Kantar Health, slightly offset by a partial quarter of impact from a 2020 divestiture, bringing third quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth. This range is consistent with our prior guidance, but we do now expect to be approximately 0.5 point lower within that range due to the impact of the VA assessment that Brent discussed during his prepared remarks. 
Despite our slightly lower revenue expectations, we are confident in our ability to more than offset this top line impact with ongoing expense control as reflected in our enhanced EPS outlook. That outlook calls for third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% over Q3 of 2020. 
And for the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be approximately $3.25, reflecting growth of about 14% over last year and up from our prior guidance of more than $3.20 per share. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20% and  we expect to generate approximately $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, up from $857 million last year. 
Finally, we remain on track to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attracted both strategically and financially. 
In summary, I am pleased with our second quarter results and believe the work we have done and are continuing to do will position us and our clients for success in the second half of 2021 and beyond. We are making good progress against our strategic focus areas behind disciplined operational execution during a time of significant change. 
Personally, I am very proud and genuinely appreciative of the dedication and professionalism we are seeing each and every day from Cerner associates all around the world, and I want to take a moment to thank all of them on behalf of Cerner's entire executive leadership team. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

There's a lot of areas, I think, that have momentum and focus, some of which Brent articulated in his script, I think, a lot of interest in real-time hospital strategies in part because of the workforce disruption that they're dealing with, with their providers. strong and ongoing interest in consumer strategies. As I've had to think through now what that is going to look like in a post-pandemic new normal. And then I think interestingly, a lot of conversations and active conversations about value-based care and how they want to think about a business model going forward, particularly as it relates to areas such as Medicare Advantage. So it's an interesting landscape. I think people feeling good in the main about how they've recovered in the first half and asking, I think, some questions about where they want to take the business that create real opportunities for us."

I think Don is spot on. I mean we're we're seeing in our U.S. client base, though the first half was some challenges in our federal business, although I'm confident in that business holistically moving forward. But we were able to perform well in our U.S. client business in globally. And so we see good opportunities and a large expansion and extension base inside of our U.S. client. We're focused on that. We see great opportunities to campaign around client value with our strategic growth businesses and products. I think there's buying opportunity in community works that we expect to go and be aggressive and win. And then our federal business and global business has been very robust this year as we've had great wins in the Middle East, U.K. and other parts of the globe in Canada.

I think once you move outside the 4 walls, we -- as I said earlier, I think there's a lot of traction and trend around provider network and what it looks like to make those operate in an integrated fashion for fee-for-service and fee-for-value. So that's an area we like quite a bit.

I think about our federal business holistically. It is encompassed by DoD, VA and other opportunity. As Brent noted, we're very pleased with the DoD space. I mean, that wave Carson till log was probably the single largest go-live that we've ever had in my 20 years that I've seen in the industry. And so we're moving forward very well with DoD, which bodes well for us as it relates to our VA business as well. For those that can recall, and I was on the journey, we -- after our Fairchild go-live with DoD, we are in a similar position to we are -- to what we are in VA. And we took about 12 months to work on a lot of the similar things we're working on at VA. And so as Brent noted in his opening remarks, the strategic assessment wasn't a surprise to us. We supported it. We both need to be ready to move forward collectively. And as the administration came in and the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary who we've spoken to and expressed mutual support have come in, we're really going to be focused on governance, training, site readiness, change management. To your question directly, I think on the second half, we expect to continue to do value-add work. We've got opportunities and we've got backlog service work that we're doing. We've got readiness assessments that we'll be doing. We'll be doing technical and solution configuration and deployment. So we'll all be very productive work in support of going forward in '22. We've noted the wave impact to the right. I'll also note that the VA contract is a 10-year IDIQ contract. The revenue opportunities and the other opportunities aren't lost. Those are deferred into out years. I expect that we'll exit this year with a good plan with better alignment at the agency level with governance collectively. And we'll start to move into wave activity and go-live activity in '22. And then I really think we'll start to hit industrial strength and pick up in '23, '24 and beyond similar to like we did on the DoD business."

So we talked about 3 principal items. One was the $48 million charge for the capitalized R&D, and this is related to the optimization work we're doing on the portfolio itself, where there's a lot of redundant products and features, and we're finding ways to drive that into a more normalized state. That probably has about $8 million to $9 million of annual savings associated with it. On the property side, we talked about the $68 million adjustment there to bring the 1 property that we're marketing largely in line with fair value based on the assessments that we've had done and the appraisals that we've received. That's probably going to save us about $10 million annually between depreciation and operating costs. At this point, we plan to action roughly 15% of our total owned office space. We had about 6.5 million square feet before the actions we took. And as I cited, we sold 260,000 square feet of space and we now have another 750,000 square feet that is being marketed for sale. And then on the reduction in force, we talked about a $54 million charge. That covered a little bit north of 500 people. We also eliminated about 300 open positions. And normally, what you see in something like that is that the annualized savings is roughly equal to amount of the severance cost themselves. So maybe call that an additional $50 million. So between those 3 items, that's probably about $70 million of annualized savings that we've been able to capture."

I think clients are early in terms of really thinking through magnitude and impact of those changes which are not just technical in nature, but as your question implies, also has big implications for them in terms of how they think about master data management across their enterprise assets and their provider network. So I think we're early in that conversation with our clients and they're kind of thinking around it. I think it sets up a ton of business opportunities for us. So first and foremost, it's a good example of where the relevance of our technology assets to a regulatory action make us center front and center in terms of how clients need to think about their strategies and approach. So we're right in the middle of that conversation, and we're relevant to it by definition. It then sets up some of those growth opportunity dialogues that I described earlier, had has been thinking about cyber and how they want to think about security risks associated with data management. It has been thinking about near real-time data strategies for how they tackle things like capacity management workforce. And importantly, it has them thinking about the role of data, not just in terms of transforming their hospital operations, but also larger commercial opportunities for provider organizations in that space. So it's is a great example of where if we can be smart around regulatory landscape, understand it better than early-stage companies or big tech companies who want to get into this vertical and then have the right conversations with our clients. It can be a huge tailwind for us from a booked revenue and revenue perspective over the next 36 months."

Is there someone who has the size and scale capabilities to integrate and make that provider network operate effectively against their contract strategies. And we're set up incredibly well to do that, not only with the EMR assets but also with CareAware and with more importantly, healthy intent. So that's where this market is going to move away from hundreds and hundreds of point solution buying decisions to looking to who is someone who I can count on to drive integration. And importantly, that really understands the provider workflow integration opportunities, both within the standards that exist today, but also the integration that needs to occur to actually profitably manage a patient for fee-for-service or take first dollar risk in an area like MA."

Thanks, Adam. Great question. So as Brent framed up in his remarks, we now not only have publicly cloud-enabled HealtheIntent, but we've also now had a second successful platform move with Career which drives not only our device integration strategies, but also is core to our sort of growth rates in that space around real-time hospitals. So I think that has been a really good technical learning for us in terms of what path to modernization looks like. it's also surfaced some really important nontechnical capabilities that we need to build out in terms of how we think about contract management and other parts of what it looks like to go work through that strategy across our client base. So I would say the progress there has been positive, including some important milestones in the first half of this year. In terms of Amazon and AWS's sort of strategies around the health care vertical, again, as I said earlier, there's a long history of big cap entry and big cap exit from health care. There's an inherent complexity at the intersection of health care and IT. I see market interest in areas that we're focused on is very validating of the growth opportunity that exists. And what we need to be able to do is be smart around where we can competitively differentiate from a fire-based strategy for data aggregation and that's interesting. But in our case, where we have deep competency around the very dirty data in health care and what it looks like to normalize that data around master data management and have a level of clarity around it that you could imagine it being pushed into the provider workflow and being leveraged as part of a care process. Those are very different things."

We know we've been spending $800 million a year in the R&D area. We talked about the fact that our product portfolio at this point is very dispersed. We took 25,000 features. We combine those into 400 different products that were assembled into 82 different product groups. And those top 25 product groups accounted for 85-plus percent of our revenue. We also talked about the fact that 1 of the opportunities we have is to dramatically enhance our management reporting systems, and that's 1 of the things that we've been spending a lot of time doing so that we can really allocate that $800 million specifically to projects. And one of the things I'm really excited about that we've been able to bring forward here in just the last few weeks, frankly, is we now have an internal system that lets us look at every single one of our scrum teams, 641 of them to be exact. And we can now know exactly what those scrum teams are doing each and every week. There's clear milestones and markers for the work that needs to be delivered and we can literally penetrate that at a very, very granular level now, which was a capability we didn't previously have. So I think the answer is probably going to likely be yes, in the sense that we are going to be able to do a whole lot more with that money. And if in fact, that's true, we might be able to do it with a little less. We've been spending roughly 14% of sales on R&D each and every year. That's a very large number. But we'll see as it plays itself out. The great thing is, is that we're getting a lot of visibility and line of sight Don and his team is leading a very comprehensive review of that product set. And then Jerome, with the work he's doing on the digital factory is going to make the dollars we are spending a whole lot more efficient. It's just as a matter of course.

I think we're still very excited in the core enterprise space around some of the things, frankly, we're doing around the core offer in areas like front-end access management and engaging access with kind of a patient-centric lens around the revenue cycle space. Lot of traction and trend there from a -- with Travis' team in the market. So excited about that, certainly excited about what we're doing in the RTHS space. And consumer more broadly has been a very strong space for us, not only native capabilities but also partner capabilities inside our consumer framework and a ton of traction and trend around unified communications. So some really nice momentum, I think, around enterprise capabilities and enterprise capabilities that extend out into the provider network space as we get over on to the continuum side and we start thinking about the provider network landscape, we're seeing a lot of traction and trend around behavioral health. A huge successful outcome there with longtime partner, UHS in the second quarter that we're very excited about really gives us a chance to build out end-to-end venue capabilities from a BH perspective in an area that, as you know, has a lot of COVID-related tailwinds, I'll say, but obviously, the complexity and crisis of behavioral health and mental health coming out of COVID. So I really like that area. And then look both the organic update as we think about the data space and data strategies around intelligence, but also some of the inorganic activity that we alluded to, both today as it relates to the integration of Kantar but also how we think about putting the balance sheet to work in the future. So we're happy with the progress in this space. We see some nice traction in the first half of the year around areas where we've made bets -- And now we need it to go further faster for scale impact over the next 2, 4, 6 quarters."

But we're also thinking about scale attributes and what it looks like to leverage some of the benefits of things like the investment that Jerome and keep gene making in the digital factory. And so that gives us scale attributes across all the platforms. and at the same time, allows us to be efficient in terms of how we think it costs the sale inside the enterprise space, but also to operate with a little bit more autonomy and flexibility in areas that are very different than our core provider market."

What are you going to do different? So we're -- I'm going to talk about what's improved. I've talked in the past -- And these are matters of discipline and a matter of focus. I think that we're doing more in terms of how we're aligning to our clients. So we've mentioned earlier some of the actions we've taken. Those actions really, in my view, were to improve our client alignment. So we flattened out our client organization. We've tried to eliminate the number of touch points to our clients. to really be more strategic with how we engage with them. We think that's important not only to -- on a value retention level, but also to expand strategies that Don and team have noted prior. So better client alignment our end-to-end delivery commitments are crucial. We not only sell in the client organization, but we deliver on our promises. And so we're really focused on how do we take our managed services, consulting and support businesses and deliver to our clients on an end-to-end basis to where we not just get to go live, but we actually get there by meeting our commitments with good data insights along the entirety of that path. And so an end-to-end focus on delivery is also crucial for us as we continue to meet and keep client commitments. And then we have a set of I think, great tools and capabilities that we weren't getting to our clients, I think, in the most efficient manner. So we've got data-driven insights. We have a treasure trove of data through our lights on network. And we're working closely to develop comprehensive programming at a client level. So specific client strategic planning based on their needs and their value needs and then bringing the right tools and tool sets market enabled to those clients. And we've done a lot of targeted work around blueprint activity in the clinical space around configuration evaluation around upgrades and uplifts. It's all of those things collectively together that improve the client experience. And I think we're in the -- we're heading in the right direction. That work is never done. There's always work to do to proceed in that area. But I like how we're thinking about it in a holistic manner, and I like how we're more strategic, I think, in our approach with clients individually. But we've got a ways to go. And to your second half of your question, I think back to the earlier question, I like how we're competing. I like our focus. I think that winning in the market is driving value for our clients. And we know our clients' needs. I think we've got better market insights, working closely with our marketing organization. I think that we're improving the way that we think about sales enablement. And so as we work on our IP infrastructure, as we sharpen our product focus, we're also working on how do we generate demand and lead, but also how do we get to market more quickly as Brent noted, with Velocity. And so the work that we've been doing the last 3 years, frankly, is starting to come to fruition, and we've seen really good progress, as Don noted, with real-time health system I think well campaign around remote patient monitoring, referral management. Key areas that are outside the traditional kind of space that will really allow us to add more value, which makes us more productive with our clients and more competitive. And I'll just say our win rate is very good. I'm very happy with how we compete and the community works on new footprints. Our global footprint is outstanding. Our teams are really competing well there. So good progress, lots to do. We're in a highly competitive environment. We've got a tough competitor, but we welcome the competition. It makes us better and we're seeking to get better and win every day."

And I know we had it in the prepared remarks, but I might just bear repeating here. In Q2, our gross margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, right? But despite the fact that gross margin compressed by 200 basis points, our adjusted operating margin was actually up by 220 right? That's a 400 basis point reversal in effect. Now only 30 of that came from divestitures, right? So a lot of this was just hard work being done by the team broadly speaking. As we think about the revenue plot going forward, one of the things that we're doing is we are also, like I said, strengthening our management reporting capabilities to allow us to have better understanding of the different growth vectors that we have organically. So we right now are building out what I'll call, 16 fully allocated business group P&Ls within the company, which we never had before. We are going to be able to have 16 businesses that we have general managers effectively in charge of with full accountability with multifunctional resource teams that we can use for our planning processes. And right now, we are going through that process to build out our 3-year plan. We have a December due date with the Board, whereby we are going to share our fiscal '22, '23 and '24 plans at a level that we've never built them up before, right, with full involvement across the full entire broad-based leadership team so that we have clear revenue bridges and everything else that goes along with it. So I think us taking that step to get to the 16 internal fully allocated P&Ls for the business groups will be a big enabler for us as we think about where do we want to really drive a point of impact across the business itself. And that will then inform, I think, also our strategic M&A process because once we have a better understanding of what we can really expect internally, we have a better line of sight into what we might need to enhance our capabilities with respect to. So more to come on [indiscernible] Certainly, we need time to build out that next 3-year plan at a very, very detailed level and I'm committed to doing that."

The attrition -- in terms of attrition, I'd say we've made vast improvements over where we've been over the last several years. I can't say specifically where we're at. But our net gains have been double digits in terms of our net on that. And it's also obviously been revenue positive for us on the net versus attrition versus gain for the first half of the year.

We're well on path based on first half performance, including 6 new clients in Q2. who have said, hey, we want to participate in research related economics. That drives a couple of different kind of business model opportunities for us. One, we have some partner economics that sit in that strategy related to our partnership and investment with Elligo. So they have to do some work often. If you're not IUH or you're not banner with the UA asset or you're not MedStar with Georgetown, those midsized provider organizations have to do some work around site readiness and what it looks like to be educated for how to participate, document and deal with audit-related realities of what it looks like to participate in the clinical trial. So we have some small economics associated with that. And then, yes, we're creating trial opportunities with our Kantar business where we're going in and engaging with life sciences and pharma, those top 25 players and bringing those opportunities back to those learning health network members, and angio-reactually sharing in those economics around that research activity.

The second thing I would say is we've done some really good work, I think, methodologically to take the NIST framework and really say, what would it look like to look at this space from a systems level. And really try to think about what the holistic opportunity looks like. And then finally, a lot of what we're doing in that space modestly today from a top line perspective is down market. It's with our smaller and midsized hospital clients where we're going in and providing those as-a-service capabilities. And really, I think using it as an opportunity to say, what would it look like to do this upmarket for larger clients inside our client community. And then importantly, how do you also think about it for provider network and all the technology heterogeneity and complexity of what it looks like to do this with a combination of owned and affiliated facility footprint. So this is an interesting space. Our competency in it is growing, both in terms of what the business opportunity looks like. But also, candidly, in terms of some of the public sector work that Travis is driving in terms of what it looks like to fulfill the needs, the DoD, the VA and really imagine what it would be like to do it at scale.

On our last call, we talked about our sharpened focus and increased sense of urgency to deliver value to our clients and shareholders. And as Mark will discuss, this increased focus and urgency helped us deliver very solid results in the second quarter. 
All key metrics reflected good progress on our transformation initiatives and a strengthening market presence. And based on this progress, we have increased our earnings outlook for the year again. What pleases me most is that as we undergo our transformation, we're maintaining an unwavering focus on client success, which is truly our North Star. 
Our key initiatives, which include product rationalization, driving operating efficiencies and continuing to refine our operating structure, all revolve around creating client value through accelerated innovation. And we expect these same efforts to also drive sustainable and profitable growth that should create value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to share some examples of progress we're making. Through improved focus and structure in our client organization, Travis and his team have grown our sales funnel and improved sales and client relationship management resulting in 24 new client footprints so far this year while reducing client attrition. 
We've also improved our overall Net Promoter Score by 5 points and have delivered 49 major client go-lives. Don and his team have made meaningful progress on several fronts as well, including advancing our product rationalization work which is creating better focus and freeing investment dollars for products that create the most value for clients and driving good sales and go-live activity in key areas such as real-time health, behavioral health, consumer, health network and data, which the progress -- with the progress in data space, including a successful onboarding of Kantar Health during the second quarter. 
Now in our technology organization, Jerome Labat, who is our CTO, has made good progress on solution and platform modernization, including being ahead of schedule on migrating CareAware to the cloud, also improving our ambulatory solution and increasing the scale of CommunityWorks, all while maintaining 99.99%, 4 9s of incident free time for our clients. He's also advanced our digital factory, which is a set of capabilities and services that power the product life cycle from initial requirements to building, delivering and running our products. 
This important work should drive R&D efficiencies, improve quality, increase innovation velocity and speed to market and lower cost of running and supporting our products. These leaders have made this progress while also delivering cost savings through restructuring and flattening their organizations, centralizing functions and also implementing tools to increase efficiency and improve the way we are running our business. And further, Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resources Officer, has helped us navigate these changes while staying focused on culture and ensuring Cerner remains a great place to work. 
Now this is reflected in being named one of the world's best employers by Forbes. And we've also just recently received recognition by Forbes as one of the top 60 best employers for diversity. And also for being among the best employers for women. In summary, we continue to make very good progress, both inside Cerner and in the marketplace. Our products and services are well aligned with our clients' needs as they face pressure to control operating costs, address provider burnout, meet increasing consumer demands, expand service lines and also to build networks to improve performance in the evolving reimbursement environment. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. The Department of Defence continues to move at full speed with deploying MHS GENESIS, their Cerner-powered EHR. In late April, DoD went live with Wave Carson, which included 25 military treatment commands, 148 physical locations across 11 states and 2 time zones. In total, the DoD is now live at 42 commands, 663 locations with more than 41,000 activated users, demonstrating that the system can be deployed at scale and on schedule. And later this year, DoD plans to go-live at facilities in Hawaii and the U.S. Coast Guard has planned go-lives for both their Pacific and Atlantic waves, which will complete the Coast Card deployment as planned. 
Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA recently completed their strategic review, which we strongly supported and issued a comprehensive report. And importantly, these fine leads were generally not technology-related. Instead, they were more focused on governance, training and site readiness. And we're consistent -- highly consistent with the findings of our own internal assessment conducted earlier this year. 
We're working very closely with the VA on the project plan and ensuring we properly address all identified issues so we can deliver a time -- a lifetime of seamless care for our veterans. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Denis McDonough has reiterated his commitment to the program and to Cerner. And in return, Cerner has reiterated our commitment to the VA and our nation's veterans. And while the VA finalizes their new governance and management structure, we will continue to our predeployment efforts, including technical development and enhancements, solution readiness and site preparation, but no further go-lives are expected until 2022. And as a result, we now expect another 0.5 point of impact on our 2021 revenue growth, which is reflected in our updated guidance for the year. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to quickly comment on the status of my transition and the search for a new CEO. The search process has been very active since we announced it last quarter. And as you can imagine, it is difficult to provide an exact time line given the sensitivity and importance of the search, but I believe the Board is making very good progress. I personally remain actively engaged and believe the team has been executing very well. So I'm confident we will continue to advance our key initiatives as the search continues. And as a result, I believe my successor will step into the role with Cerner well positioned for success. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with Cerner's progress so far this year. We have demonstrated the ability to execute on near-term deliverables while also driving meaningful organizational change that is positioning Cerner to realize our potential and to have a much bigger impact on health care. Mark, I'll turn it over to you."

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Bookings were up 2% versus a year ago to $1.36 billion, which brings year-to-date b",1078,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Bookings were up 2% versus a year ago to $1.36 billion, which brings year-to-date bookings growth to 7%. Importantly, we believe this represents a positive inflection point since total bookings were down during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. 
The higher rate of bookings added to our revenue backlog, which ended the second quarter at $13.2 billion, which is 1% up sequentially and down slightly versus a year ago, due primarily to divestitures. Revenue of $1.46 billion was up 10% over the year ago quarter, which was admittedly heavily impacted by COVID. The increase in revenue was driven in large part due to strong growth in federal services. 
In addition, it is worth noting that virtually all of the growth we experienced during the second quarter was organic, with $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition being largely offset by $39 million of divested revenue. 
Gross margin was down 200 basis points from a year ago at 82.1%, primarily due to the mix of revenue in the quarter. specifically, higher levels of lower-margin technology resale, third-party services and reimbursed travel. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 220 basis points from 18.4% to 20.6%, driven primarily by tight expense control and a negatively impacted year ago margin due to COVID. 
Now to build on this progress, we took bold action across our largest spend pools during the second quarter. For example, we incurred $54 million of employee separation costs due to a sizable reduction in force related to productivity improvements we recently implemented. We also incurred a charge of $68 million to reduce the properties line on our balance sheet to fair value in connection with the sale of 1 property and the designation of 2 other properties as held for sale. Since the start of the year, we have sold 260,000 square feet of office space and have earmarked an additional 750,000 square feet of space for future sale. Lastly, we recorded a charge of $48 million to reduce the carrying amount of certain capitalized software development costs to estimated net realizable value as part of our comprehensive product portfolio rationalization work, which is designed to improve over time, the return on our nearly $800 million annual R&D investment. Each of these actions and the related charges are captured in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. These actions are also consistent with our previously communicated efforts to operate more efficiently, drive more value for clients and better position Cerner for sustainable, long-term profitable growth. 
Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.80 per share, which is up 27% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower non-GAAP tax rate and a lower share count. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $885 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $1.47 billion last quarter. There are 2 things that account for the change: first, we used $350 million to close on the Kantar Health acquisition; second, we spent $400 million on share repurchases during the quarter, which brings our purchases through the end of the second quarter up to $750 million. 
We have been using a large portion of our excess cash and short-term investments throughout the year to repurchase shares because we continue to believe that Cerner stock at current trading levels represents a good return on investment for our shareholders. Sequentially, our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q1 at $1.84 billion. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $369 million. After $123 million of capital expenditures and $84 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $162 million. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $453 million, which is more than double the amount we generated during the same period last year. The significant increase in year-to-date free cash flow was driven by strong operating cash flow growth against a COVID impacted first half of 2020. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to grow approximately 6% compared to Q3 of 2020. This includes just over $40 million of revenue from Kantar Health, slightly offset by a partial quarter of impact from a 2020 divestiture, bringing third quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth. This range is consistent with our prior guidance, but we do now expect to be approximately 0.5 point lower within that range due to the impact of the VA assessment that Brent discussed during his prepared remarks. 
Despite our slightly lower revenue expectations, we are confident in our ability to more than offset this top line impact with ongoing expense control as reflected in our enhanced EPS outlook. That outlook calls for third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% over Q3 of 2020. 
And for the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be approximately $3.25, reflecting growth of about 14% over last year and up from our prior guidance of more than $3.20 per share. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%, and we expect to generate approximately $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, up from $857 million last year. 
Finally, we remain on track to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attracted both strategically and financially. 
In summary, I am pleased with our second quarter results and believe the work we have done and are continuing to do will position us and our clients for success in the second half of 2021 and beyond. We are making good progress against our strategic focus areas behind disciplined operational execution during a time of significant change. 
Personally, I am very proud and genuinely appreciative of the dedication and professionalism we are seeing each and every day from Cerner associates all around the world, and I want to take a moment to thank all of them on behalf of Cerner's entire executive leadership team. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I think, at the same time, sort of watching with the weary eye as the Delta variant plays forward and certainly disrupt certain hotspots. So I think broadly, volumes feel good. There's a lot of areas, I think, that have momentum and focus, some of which Brent articulated in his script, I think, a lot of interest in real-time hospital strategies in part because of the workforce disruption that they're dealing with, with their providers. Strong and ongoing interest in consumer strategies. As I've had to think through now what that is going to look like in a post-pandemic new normal. And then I think interestingly, a lot of conversations and active conversations about value-based care and how they want to think about a business model going forward, particularly as it relates to areas such as Medicare Advantage. So it's an interesting landscape. I think people feeling good in the main about how they've recovered in the first half and asking, I think, some questions about where they want to take the business that create real opportunities for us."

And so we're really working to underpin our plans and our forecast with tools, automation and discipline. And that will give us greater confidence as we move in visibility to the top line forward. I think Don is spot on. I mean we're seeing in our U.S. client base, though the first half was some challenges in our federal business, although I'm confident in that business holistically moving forward. But we were able to perform well in our U.S. client business in globally. And so we see good opportunities and a large expansion and extension base inside of our U.S. client. We're focused on that. We see great opportunities to campaign around client value with our strategic growth businesses and products. I think there's buying opportunity in CommunityWorks that we expect to go and be aggressive and win. And then our federal business and global business has been very robust this year as we've had great wins in the Middle East, U.K. and other parts of the globe in Canada. So I'm confident in the second half of the year. I think we've accurately reflected the nature of the federal business and been transparent about that.

I think about our federal business holistically. It is encompassed by DoD, VA and other opportunity. As Brent noted, we're very pleased with the DoD space. I mean, that Wave Carson go-live was probably the single largest go-live that we've ever had in my 20 years that I've seen in the industry. And so we're moving forward very well with DoD, which bodes well for us as it relates to our VA business as well. For those that can recall, and I was on the journey, we -- after our Fairchild go-live with DoD, we are in a similar position to we are -- to what we are in VA. And we took about 12 months to work on a lot of the similar things we're working on at VA. And so as Brent noted in his opening remarks, the strategic assessment wasn't a surprise to us. We supported it. We both need to be ready to move forward collectively. And as the administration came in and the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary who we've spoken to and expressed mutual support have come in, we're really going to be focused on governance, training, site readiness, change management. To your question directly, I think on the second half, we expect to continue to do value-add work. We've got opportunities and we've got backlog service work that we're doing. We've got readiness assessments that we'll be doing. We'll be doing technical and solution configuration and deployment. So it will all be very productive work in support of going forward in '22. We've noted the wave impact to the right. I'll also note that the VA contract is a 10-year IDIQ contract. The revenue opportunities and the other opportunities aren't lost. Those are deferred into out years. I expect that we'll exit this year with a good plan with better alignment at the agency level with governance collectively. And we'll start to move into wave activity and go-live activity in '22. And then I really think we'll start to hit industrial strength and pick up in '23, '24 and beyond similar to like we did on the DoD business."

So we talked about 3 principal items. One was the $48 million charge for the capitalized R&D, and this is related to the optimization work we're doing on the portfolio itself, where there's a lot of redundant products and features, and we're finding ways to drive that into a more normalized state. That probably has about $8 million to $9 million of annual savings associated with it. On the property side, we talked about the $68 million adjustment there to bring the 1 property that we're marketing largely in line with fair value based on the assessments that we've had done and the appraisals that we've received. That's probably going to save us about $10 million annually between depreciation and operating costs. At this point, we plan to action roughly 15% of our total owned office space. We had about 6.5 million square feet before the actions we took. And as I cited, we sold 260,000 square feet of space and we now have another 750,000 square feet that is being marketed for sale. And then on the reduction in force, we talked about a $54 million charge. That covered a little bit north of 500 people. We also eliminated about 300 open positions. And normally, what you see in something like that is that the annualized savings is roughly equal to amount of the severance cost themselves. So maybe call that an additional $50 million. So between those 3 items, that's probably about $70 million of annualized savings that we've been able to capture."

So one, I think we have been making some material investments around 21st Century Cares and what it looks like for our end-to-end product set to be fully compliant with it. I think clients are early in terms of really thinking through magnitude and impact of those changes which are not just technical in nature, but as your question implies, also has big implications for them in terms of how they think about master data management across their enterprise assets and their provider network. So I think we're early in that conversation with our clients and they're kind of thinking around it. I think it sets up a ton of business opportunities for us. So first and foremost, it's a good example of where the relevance of our technology assets to a regulatory action make us center -- front and center in terms of how clients need to think about their strategies and approach. So we're right in the middle of that conversation, and we're relevant to it by definition. It then sets up some of those growth opportunity dialogues that I described earlier, it has been thinking about cyber and how they want to think about security risks associated with data management. It has been thinking about near real-time data strategies for how they tackle things like capacity management workforce. And importantly, it has them thinking about the role of data, not just in terms of transforming their hospital operations, but also larger commercial opportunities for provider organizations in that space. So it's a great example of where if we can be smart around regulatory landscape, understand it better than early-stage companies or big tech companies who want to get into this vertical and then have the right conversations with our clients. It can be a huge tailwind for us from a booked revenue and revenue perspective over the next 36 months."

At the end of the day, particularly as you see its trend outside the hospital in the provider network space, they're looking for integration. Is there someone who has the size and scale capabilities to integrate and make that provider network operate effectively against their contract strategies. And we're set up incredibly well to do that, not only with the EMR assets but also with CareAware and with more importantly, healthy intent. So that's where this market is going to move away from hundreds and hundreds of point solution buying decisions to looking to who is someone who I can count on to drive integration. And importantly, that really understands the provider workflow integration opportunities, both within the standards that exist today, but also the integration that needs to occur to actually profitably manage a patient for fee-for-service or take first dollar risk in an area like MA."

Thanks, Adam. Great question. So as Brent framed up in his remarks, we now not only have publicly cloud-enabled HealtheIntent, but we've also now had a second successful platform move with CareAware, which drives not only our device integration strategies, but also is core to our sort of growth strategies in that space around real-time hospitals. So I think that has been a really good technical learning for us in terms of what path to modernization looks like. It's also surfaced some really important nontechnical capabilities that we need to build out in terms of how we think about contract management and other parts of what it looks like to go work through that strategy across our client base. So I would say the progress there has been positive, including some important milestones in the first half of this year. In terms of Amazon and AWS' sort of strategies around the health care vertical, again, as I said earlier, there's a long history of big cap entry and big cap exit from health care. There's an inherent complexity at the intersection of health care and IT. I see market interest in areas that we're focused on is very validating of the growth opportunity that exists. And what we need to be able to do is be smart around where we can competitively differentiate from a fire-based strategy for data aggregation, that's interesting. But in our case, where we have deep competency around the very dirty data in health care and what it looks like to normalize that data around master data management and have a level of clarity around it that you could imagine it being pushed into the provider workflow and being leveraged as part of a care process. Those are very different things."

We know we've been spending $800 million a year in the R&D area. We talked about the fact that our product portfolio at this point is very dispersed. We took 25,000 features. We combine those into 400 different products that were assembled into 82 different product groups. And those top 25 product groups accounted for 85-plus percent of our revenue. We also talked about the fact that one of the opportunities we have is to dramatically enhance our management reporting systems, and that's one of the things that we've been spending a lot of time doing so that we can really allocate that $800 million specifically to projects. And one of the things I'm really excited about that we've been able to bring forward here in just the last few weeks, frankly, is we now have an internal system that lets us look at every single one of our scrum teams, 641 of them to be exact. And we can now know exactly what those scrum teams are doing each and every week. There's clear milestones and markers for the work that needs to be delivered and we can literally penetrate that at a very, very granular level now, which was a capability we didn't previously have. So I think the answer is probably going to likely be yes, in the sense that we are going to be able to do a whole lot more with that money. And if in fact, that's true, we might be able to do it with a little less. We've been spending roughly 14% of sales on R&D each and every year. That's a very large number. But we'll see as it plays itself out. The great thing is, is that we're getting a lot of visibility and line of sight. Don and his team is leading a very comprehensive review of that product set. And then Jerome, with the work he's doing on the digital factory is going to make the dollars we are spending a whole lot more efficient. It's just is a matter of course. So I'm very excited about what's happening in that whole area."

I think we're still very excited in the core enterprise space around some of the things, frankly, we're doing around the core offer in areas like front-end access management and engaging access with kind of a patient-centric lens around the revenue cycle space. Lot of traction and trend there from a -- with Travis' team in the market. So excited about that, certainly, excited about what we're doing in the RTHS space. And consumer more broadly has been a very strong space for us, not only native capabilities but also partner capabilities inside our consumer framework and a ton of traction and trend around unified communications. So some really nice momentum, I think, around enterprise capabilities and enterprise capabilities that extend out into the provider network space as we get over on to the continuum side and we start thinking about the provider network landscape, we're seeing a lot of traction and trend around behavioral health. A huge successful outcome there with longtime partner, UHS in the second quarter that we're very excited about really gives us a chance to build out end-to-end venue capabilities from a BH perspective in an area that, as you know, has a lot of COVID-related tailwinds, I'll say, but obviously, the complexity and crisis of behavioral health and mental health coming out of COVID. So I really like that area. And then look both the organic update as we think about the data space and data strategies around intelligence, but also some of the inorganic activity that we alluded to, both today as it relates to the integration of Kantar but also how we think about putting the balance sheet to work in the future. So we're happy with the progress in this space. We see some nice traction in the first half of the year around areas where we've made bets. And now we need it to go further faster for scale impact over the next 2, 4, 6 quarters."

But we're also thinking about scale attributes and what it looks like to leverage some of the benefits of things like the investment that Jerome and Keith Jahn are making in the digital factory. And so that gives us scale attributes across all the platforms. and at the same time, allows us to be efficient in terms of how we think it costs the sale inside the enterprise space, but also to operate with a little bit more autonomy and flexibility in areas that are very different than our core provider market."

So we're -- I'm going to talk about what's improved. I've talked in the past. And these are matters of discipline and the matter of focus. I think that we're doing more in terms of how we're aligning to our clients. So we've mentioned earlier some of the actions we've taken. Those actions really, in my view, were to improve our client alignment. So we flattened out our client organization. We've tried to eliminate the number of touch points to our clients, to really be more strategic with how we engage with them. We think that's important not only to -- on a value retention level, but also to expand strategies that Don and team have noted prior. So better client alignment, our end-to-end delivery commitments are crucial. We not only sell in the client organization, but we deliver on our promises. And so we're really focused on how do we take our managed services, consulting and support businesses and deliver to our clients on an end-to-end basis to where we not just get to go-live, but we actually get there by meeting our commitments with good data insights along the entirety of that path. And so an end-to-end focus on delivery is also crucial for us as we continue to meet and keep client commitments. And then we have a set of I think, great tools and capabilities that we weren't getting to our clients, I think, in the most efficient manner. So we've got data-driven insights. We have a treasure trove of data through our lights on network. And we're working closely to develop comprehensive programming at a client level. So specific client strategic planning based on their needs and their value needs and then bringing the right tools and tool sets market-enabled to those clients. And we've done a lot of targeted work around blueprint activity in the clinical space around configuration evaluation around upgrades and uplifts. It's all of those things collectively together that improve the client experience. And I think we're in the -- we're heading in the right direction. That work is never done. There's always work to do to proceed in that area. But I like how we're thinking about it in a holistic manner, and I like how we're more strategic, I think, in our approach with clients individually. But we've got ways to go. And to your second half of your question, I think back to the earlier question, I like how we're competing. I like our focus. I think that winning in the market is driving value for our clients. And we know our clients' needs. I think we've got better market insights, working closely with our marketing organization. I think that we're improving the way that we think about sales enablement. And so as we work on our IP infrastructure, as we sharpen our product focus, we're also working on how do we generate demand and lead, but also how do we get to market more quickly as Brent noted, with Velocity. And so the work that we've been doing the last 3 years, frankly, is starting to come to fruition, and we've seen really good progress, as Don noted, with real-time health system. I think we'll campaign around remote patient monitoring, referral management. Key areas that are outside the traditional kind of EMR space that will really allow us to add more value, which makes us more productive with our clients and more competitive. And I'll just say our win rate is very good. I'm very happy with how we competed in the CommunityWorks on new footprints. Our global footprint is outstanding. Our teams are really competing well there. So good progress, lots to do. We're in a highly competitive environment. We've got a tough competitor, but we welcome the competition. It makes us better and we're seeking to get better and win every day."

And so once we find ourselves in a position to actually affect the sale then you'll start to see the benefit of that $10 million largely roll through.

And I know we had it in the prepared remarks, but I might just bear repeating here. In Q2, our gross margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, right? But despite the fact that gross margin compressed by 200 basis points, our adjusted operating margin was actually up by 220 right? That's a 400 basis point reversal in effect. Now only 30 of that came from divestitures, right? So a lot of this was just hard work being done by the team broadly speaking. As we think about the revenue plot going forward, one of the things that we're doing is we are also, like I said, strengthening our management reporting capabilities to allow us to have better understanding of the different growth vectors that we have organically. So we right now, are building out what I'll call, 16 fully allocated business group P&Ls within the company, which we never had before. We are going to be able to have 16 businesses that we have general managers effectively in charge of with full accountability with multifunctional resource teams that we can use for our planning processes. And right now, we are going through that process to build out our 3-year plan. We have a December due date with the Board, whereby we are going to share our fiscal '22, '23 and '24 plans at a level that we've never built them up before, right, with full involvement across the full entire broad-based leadership team so that we have clear revenue bridges and everything else that goes along with it. So I think us taking that step to get to the 16 internal fully allocated P&Ls for the business groups will be a big enabler for us as we think about where do we want to really drive a point of impact across the business itself. And that will then inform, I think, also our strategic M&A process because once we have a better understanding of what we can really expect internally, we have a better line of sight into what we might need to enhance our capabilities with respect to. So more to come on that. Certainly, we need time to build out that next 3-year plan at a very, very detailed level and I'm committed to doing that."

The attrition -- in terms of attrition, I'd say we've made vast improvements over where we've been over the last several years. I can't say specifically where we're at. But our net gains have been double digits in terms of our net on that. And it's also obviously been revenue-positive for us on the net versus attrition versus gain for the first half of the year. That's a good positive turn in trend for us. The last 3 or 4 years, as many of you know, were tough for us, and we had some downward momentum on that.

But as you said, the lion's share of the revenue is sitting over around the strategies associated with life sciences and pharma. So we have a set of provider organizations that participate in our Learning Health Network. So we're targeting 80 participants by the end of the year. We're well on path based on first half performance, including 6 new clients in Q2, who have said, hey, we want to participate in research-related economics. That drives a couple of different kind of business model opportunities for us. One, we have some partner economics that sit in that strategy related to our partnership and investment with Elligo. So they have to do some work often. If you're not IUH or you're not Banner with the UFAA asset or you're not MedStar with Georgetown, those midsized provider organizations have to do some work around site readiness and what it looks like to be educated for how to participate, document and deal with audit-related realities of what it looks like to participate in the clinical trial. So we have some small economics associated with that. And then, yes, we're creating trial opportunities with our Kantar business where we're going in and engaging with life sciences and pharma, those top 25 players and bringing those opportunities back to those learning health network members, and we're actually sharing in those economics around that research activity. And then finally, Kantar obviously has a stand-alone set of businesses that predate their integration into Cerner that include, as Allan alluded to, strategic consulting work that are the final component of the business model."

And when you think about hybrid environments with a combination of on-prem and cloud, the opportunity set to manage those environments is very high. So a really interesting space. The second thing I would say is we've done some really good work, I think, methodologically to take the NIST framework and really say, what would it look like to look at this space from a systems level and really try to think about what the holistic opportunity looks like. And then finally, a lot of what we're doing in that space modestly today from a top line perspective is down market. It's with our smaller and midsized hospital clients where we're going in and providing those as-a-service capabilities. And really, I think using it as an opportunity to say, what would it look like to do this upmarket for larger clients inside our client community. And then importantly, how do you also think about it for provider network and all the technology heterogeneity and complexity of what it looks like to do this with a combination of owned and affiliated facility footprint. So this is an interesting space. Our competency in it is growing, both in terms of what the business opportunity looks like. But also, candidly, in terms of some of the public sector work that Travis is driving in terms of what it looks like to fulfill the needs, the DoD, the VA and really imagine what it would be like to do it at scale.

On our last call, we talked about our sharpened focus and increased sense of urgency to deliver value to our clients and shareholders. And as Mark will discuss, this increased focus and urgency helped us deliver very solid results in the second quarter. 
All key metrics reflected good progress on our transformation initiatives and a strengthening market presence. And based on this progress, we have increased our earnings outlook for the year again. What pleases me most is that as we undergo our transformation, we're maintaining an unwavering focus on client success, which is truly our North Star. 
Our key initiatives, which include product rationalization, driving operating efficiencies and continuing to refine our operating structure, all revolve around creating client value through accelerated innovation. And we expect these same efforts to also drive sustainable and profitable growth that should create value for our shareholders. 
I'd like to share some examples of progress we're making. Through improved focus and structure in our client organization, Travis and his team have grown our sales funnel and improved sales and client relationship management resulting in 24 new client footprints so far this year while reducing client attrition. 
We've also improved our overall Net Promoter Score by 5 points and have delivered 49 major client go-lives. Don and his team have made meaningful progress on several fronts as well, including advancing our product rationalization work which is creating better focus and freeing investment dollars for products that create the most value for clients and driving good sales and go-live activity in key areas such as real-time health, behavioral health, consumer, health network and data, which the progress -- with the progress in data space, including a successful onboarding of Kantar Health during the second quarter. 
Now in our technology organization, Jerome Labat, who is our CTO, has made good progress on solution and platform modernization, including being ahead of schedule on migrating CareAware to the cloud, also improving our ambulatory solution and increasing the scale of CommunityWorks, all while maintaining 99.99%, 4 9s of incident free time for our clients. He's also advanced our digital factory, which is a set of capabilities and services that power the product life cycle from initial requirements to building, delivering and running our products. 
This important work should drive R&D efficiencies, improve quality, increase innovation velocity and speed to market and lower cost of running and supporting our products. These leaders have made this progress while also delivering cost savings through restructuring and flattening their organizations, centralizing functions and also implementing tools to increase efficiency and improve the way we are running our business. And further, Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resources Officer, has helped us navigate these changes while staying focused on culture and ensuring Cerner remains a great place to work. 
Now this is reflected in being named one of the world's best employers by Forbes. And we've also just recently received recognition by Forbes as one of the top 60 best employers for diversity. And also for being among the best employers for women. In summary, we continue to make very good progress, both inside Cerner and in the marketplace. Our products and services are well aligned with our clients' needs as they face pressure to control operating costs, address provider burnout, meet increasing consumer demands, expand service lines and also to build networks to improve performance in the evolving reimbursement environment. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on our federal business. The Department of Defence continues to move at full speed with deploying MHS GENESIS, their Cerner-powered EHR. In late April, DoD went live with Wave Carson, which included 25 military treatment commands, 148 physical locations across 11 states and 2 time zones. In total, the DoD is now live at 42 commands, 663 locations with more than 41,000 activated users, demonstrating that the system can be deployed at scale and on schedule. And later this year, DoD plans to go-live at facilities in Hawaii and the U.S. Coast Guard has planned go-lives for both their Pacific and Atlantic waves, which will complete the Coast Card deployment as planned. 
Moving to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA recently completed their strategic review, which we strongly supported and issued a comprehensive report. And importantly, these fine leads were generally not technology-related. Instead, they were more focused on governance, training and site readiness. And we're consistent -- highly consistent with the findings of our own internal assessment conducted earlier this year. 
We're working very closely with the VA on the project plan and ensuring we properly address all identified issues so we can deliver a time -- a lifetime of seamless care for our veterans. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Denis McDonough has reiterated his commitment to the program and to Cerner. And in return, Cerner has reiterated our commitment to the VA and our nation's veterans. And while the VA finalizes their new governance and management structure, we will continue to our predeployment efforts, including technical development and enhancements, solution readiness and site preparation, but no further go-lives are expected until 2022. And as a result, we now expect another 0.5 point of impact on our 2021 revenue growth, which is reflected in our updated guidance for the year. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to quickly comment on the status of my transition and the search for a new CEO. The search process has been very active since we announced it last quarter. And as you can imagine, it is difficult to provide an exact time line given the sensitivity and importance of the search, but I believe the Board is making very good progress. I personally remain actively engaged and believe the team has been executing very well. So I'm confident we will continue to advance our key initiatives as the search continues. And as a result, I believe my successor will step into the role with Cerner well positioned for success. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with Cerner's progress so far this year. We have demonstrated the ability to execute on near-term deliverables while also driving meaningful organizational change that is positioning Cerner to realize our potential and to have a much bigger impact on health care. Mark, I'll turn it over to you."

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Bookings were up 2% versus a year ago to $1.36 billion, which brings year-to-date b",1078,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results and provide a guidance update. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Bookings were up 2% versus a year ago to $1.36 billion, which brings year-to-date bookings growth to 7%. Importantly, we believe this represents a positive inflection point since total bookings were down during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. 
The higher rate of bookings added to our revenue backlog, which ended the second quarter at $13.2 billion, which is 1% up sequentially and down slightly versus a year ago, due primarily to divestitures. Revenue of $1.46 billion was up 10% over the year ago quarter, which was admittedly heavily impacted by COVID. The increase in revenue was driven in large part due to strong growth in federal services. 
In addition, it is worth noting that virtually all of the growth we experienced during the second quarter was organic, with $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition being largely offset by $39 million of divested revenue. 
Gross margin was down 200 basis points from a year ago at 82.1%, primarily due to the mix of revenue in the quarter. specifically, higher levels of lower-margin technology resale, third-party services and reimbursed travel. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 220 basis points from 18.4% to 20.6%, driven primarily by tight expense control and a negatively impacted year ago margin due to COVID. 
Now to build on this progress, we took bold action across our largest spend pools during the second quarter. For example, we incurred $54 million of employee separation costs due to a sizable reduction in force related to productivity improvements we recently implemented. We also incurred a charge of $68 million to reduce the properties line on our balance sheet to fair value in connection with the sale of 1 property and the designation of 2 other properties as held for sale. Since the start of the year, we have sold 260,000 square feet of office space and have earmarked an additional 750,000 square feet of space for future sale. Lastly, we recorded a charge of $48 million to reduce the carrying amount of certain capitalized software development costs to estimated net realizable value as part of our comprehensive product portfolio rationalization work, which is designed to improve over time, the return on our nearly $800 million annual R&D investment. Each of these actions and the related charges are captured in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. These actions are also consistent with our previously communicated efforts to operate more efficiently, drive more value for clients and better position Cerner for sustainable, long-term profitable growth. 
Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.80 per share, which is up 27% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower non-GAAP tax rate and a lower share count. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $885 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $1.47 billion last quarter. There are 2 things that account for the change: first, we used $350 million to close on the Kantar Health acquisition; second, we spent $400 million on share repurchases during the quarter, which brings our purchases through the end of the second quarter up to $750 million. 
We have been using a large portion of our excess cash and short-term investments throughout the year to repurchase shares because we continue to believe that Cerner stock at current trading levels represents a good return on investment for our shareholders. Sequentially, our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q1 at $1.84 billion. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $369 million. After $123 million of capital expenditures and $84 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $162 million. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $453 million, which is more than double the amount we generated during the same period last year. The significant increase in year-to-date free cash flow was driven by strong operating cash flow growth against a COVID impacted first half of 2020. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q3 to grow approximately 6% compared to Q3 of 2020. This includes just over $40 million of revenue from Kantar Health, slightly offset by a partial quarter of impact from a 2020 divestiture, bringing third quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth. This range is consistent with our prior guidance, but we do now expect to be approximately 0.5 point lower within that range due to the impact of the VA assessment that Brent discussed during his prepared remarks. 
Despite our slightly lower revenue expectations, we are confident in our ability to more than offset this top line impact with ongoing expense control as reflected in our enhanced EPS outlook. That outlook calls for third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% over Q3 of 2020. 
And for the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be approximately $3.25, reflecting growth of about 14% over last year and up from our prior guidance of more than $3.20 per share. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%, and we expect to generate approximately $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, up from $857 million last year. 
Finally, we remain on track to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attracted both strategically and financially. 
In summary, I am pleased with our second quarter results and believe the work we have done and are continuing to do will position us and our clients for success in the second half of 2021 and beyond. We are making good progress against our strategic focus areas behind disciplined operational execution during a time of significant change. 
Personally, I am very proud and genuinely appreciative of the dedication and professionalism we are seeing each and every day from Cerner associates all around the world, and I want to take a moment to thank all of them on behalf of Cerner's entire executive leadership team. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

I think, at the same time, sort of watching with the weary eye as the Delta variant plays forward and certainly disrupt certain hotspots. So I think broadly, volumes feel good. There's a lot of areas, I think, that have momentum and focus, some of which Brent articulated in his script, I think, a lot of interest in real-time hospital strategies in part because of the workforce disruption that they're dealing with, with their providers. Strong and ongoing interest in consumer strategies. As I've had to think through now what that is going to look like in a post-pandemic new normal. And then I think interestingly, a lot of conversations and active conversations about value-based care and how they want to think about a business model going forward, particularly as it relates to areas such as Medicare Advantage. So it's an interesting landscape. I think people feeling good in the main about how they've recovered in the first half and asking, I think, some questions about where they want to take the business that create real opportunities for us."

I think Don is spot on. I mean we're seeing in our U.S. client base, though the first half was some challenges in our federal business, although I'm confident in that business holistically moving forward. But we were able to perform well in our U.S. client business in globally. And so we see good opportunities and a large expansion and extension base inside of our U.S. client. We're focused on that.

And then our federal business and global business has been very robust this year as we've had great wins in the Middle East, U.K. and other parts of the globe in Canada. So I'm confident in the second half of the year. I think we've accurately reflected the nature of the federal business and been transparent about that. And so I think it's underpinned well and resilient, and we'll continue to move forward."

I think about our federal business holistically. It is encompassed by DoD, VA and other opportunity. As Brent noted, we're very pleased with the DoD space. I mean, that Wave Carson go-live was probably the single largest go-live that we've ever had in my 20 years that I've seen in the industry. And so we're moving forward very well with DoD, which bodes well for us as it relates to our VA business as well. For those that can recall, and I was on the journey, we -- after our Fairchild go-live with DoD, we are in a similar position to we are -- to what we are in VA. And we took about 12 months to work on a lot of the similar things we're working on at VA. And so as Brent noted in his opening remarks, the strategic assessment wasn't a surprise to us. We supported it. We both need to be ready to move forward collectively. And as the administration came in and the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary who we've spoken to and expressed mutual support have come in, we're really going to be focused on governance, training, site readiness, change management. To your question directly, I think on the second half, we expect to continue to do value-add work. We've got opportunities and we've got backlog service work that we're doing. We've got readiness assessments that we'll be doing. We'll be doing technical and solution configuration and deployment. So it will all be very productive work in support of going forward in '22. We've noted the wave impact to the right. I'll also note that the VA contract is a 10-year IDIQ contract. The revenue opportunities and the other opportunities aren't lost. Those are deferred into out years. I expect that we'll exit this year with a good plan with better alignment at the agency level with governance collectively. And we'll start to move into wave activity and go-live activity in '22. And then I really think we'll start to hit industrial strength and pick up in '23, '24 and beyond similar to like we did on the DoD business."

So we talked about 3 principal items. One was the $48 million charge for the capitalized R&D, and this is related to the optimization work we're doing on the portfolio itself, where there's a lot of redundant products and features, and we're finding ways to drive that into a more normalized state. That probably has about $8 million to $9 million of annual savings associated with it. On the property side, we talked about the $68 million adjustment there to bring the 1 property that we're marketing largely in line with fair value based on the assessments that we've had done and the appraisals that we've received. That's probably going to save us about $10 million annually between depreciation and operating costs. At this point, we plan to action roughly 15% of our total owned office space. We had about 6.5 million square feet before the actions we took. And as I cited, we sold 260,000 square feet of space and we now have another 750,000 square feet that is being marketed for sale. And then on the reduction in force, we talked about a $54 million charge. That covered a little bit north of 500 people. We also eliminated about 300 open positions. And normally, what you see in something like that is that the annualized savings is roughly equal to amount of the severance cost themselves. So maybe call that an additional $50 million. So between those 3 items, that's probably about $70 million of annualized savings that we've been able to capture."

So I think we're early in that conversation with our clients and they're kind of thinking around it. I think it sets up a ton of business opportunities for us. So first and foremost, it's a good example of where the relevance of our technology assets to a regulatory action make us center -- front and center in terms of how clients need to think about their strategies and approach. So we're right in the middle of that conversation, and we're relevant to it by definition. It then sets up some of those growth opportunity dialogues that I described earlier, it has been thinking about cyber and how they want to think about security risks associated with data management. It has been thinking about near real-time data strategies for how they tackle things like capacity management workforce. And importantly, it has them thinking about the role of data, not just in terms of transforming their hospital operations, but also larger commercial opportunities for provider organizations in that space. So it's a great example of where if we can be smart around regulatory landscape, understand it better than early-stage companies or big tech companies who want to get into this vertical and then have the right conversations with our clients. It can be a huge tailwind for us from a booked revenue and revenue perspective over the next 36 months."

Is there someone who has the size and scale capabilities to integrate and make that provider network operate effectively against their contract strategies. And we're set up incredibly well to do that, not only with the EMR assets but also with CareAware and with more importantly, healthy intent. So that's where this market is going to move away from hundreds and hundreds of point solution buying decisions to looking to who is someone who I can count on to drive integration.

Thanks, Adam. Great question. So as Brent framed up in his remarks, we now not only have publicly cloud-enabled HealtheIntent, but we've also now had a second successful platform move with CareAware, which drives not only our device integration strategies, but also is core to our sort of growth strategies in that space around real-time hospitals. So I think that has been a really good technical learning for us in terms of what path to modernization looks like. It's also surfaced some really important nontechnical capabilities that we need to build out in terms of how we think about contract management and other parts of what it looks like to go work through that strategy across our client base. So I would say the progress there has been positive, including some important milestones in the first half of this year. In terms of Amazon and AWS' sort of strategies around the health care vertical, again, as I said earlier, there's a long history of big cap entry and big cap exit from health care. There's an inherent complexity at the intersection of health care and IT. I see market interest in areas that we're focused on is very validating of the growth opportunity that exists. And what we need to be able to do is be smart around where we can competitively differentiate from a fire-based strategy for data aggregation, that's interesting. But in our case, where we have deep competency around the very dirty data in health care and what it looks like to normalize that data around master data management and have a level of clarity around it that you could imagine it being pushed into the provider workflow and being leveraged as part of a care process.

We know we've been spending $800 million a year in the R&D area. We talked about the fact that our product portfolio at this point is very dispersed. We took 25,000 features. We combine those into 400 different products that were assembled into 82 different product groups. And those top 25 product groups accounted for 85-plus percent of our revenue. We also talked about the fact that one of the opportunities we have is to dramatically enhance our management reporting systems, and that's one of the things that we've been spending a lot of time doing so that we can really allocate that $800 million specifically to projects. And one of the things I'm really excited about that we've been able to bring forward here in just the last few weeks, frankly, is we now have an internal system that lets us look at every single one of our scrum teams, 641 of them to be exact. And we can now know exactly what those scrum teams are doing each and every week. There's clear milestones and markers for the work that needs to be delivered and we can literally penetrate that at a very, very granular level now, which was a capability we didn't previously have. So I think the answer is probably going to likely be yes, in the sense that we are going to be able to do a whole lot more with that money. And if in fact, that's true, we might be able to do it with a little less. We've been spending roughly 14% of sales on R&D each and every year. That's a very large number. But we'll see as it plays itself out. The great thing is, is that we're getting a lot of visibility and line of sight. Don and his team is leading a very comprehensive review of that product set. And then Jerome, with the work he's doing on the digital factory is going to make the dollars we are spending a whole lot more efficient. It's just is a matter of course. So I'm very excited about what's happening in that whole area."

I think we're still very excited in the core enterprise space around some of the things, frankly, we're doing around the core offer in areas like front-end access management and engaging access with kind of a patient-centric lens around the revenue cycle space. Lot of traction and trend there from a -- with Travis' team in the market. So excited about that, certainly, excited about what we're doing in the RTHS space. And consumer more broadly has been a very strong space for us, not only native capabilities but also partner capabilities inside our consumer framework and a ton of traction and trend around unified communications. So some really nice momentum, I think, around enterprise capabilities and enterprise capabilities that extend out into the provider network space as we get over on to the continuum side and we start thinking about the provider network landscape, we're seeing a lot of traction and trend around behavioral health. A huge successful outcome there with longtime partner, UHS in the second quarter that we're very excited about really gives us a chance to build out end-to-end venue capabilities from a BH perspective in an area that, as you know, has a lot of COVID-related tailwinds, I'll say, but obviously, the complexity and crisis of behavioral health and mental health coming out of COVID. So I really like that area. And then look both the organic update as we think about the data space and data strategies around intelligence, but also some of the inorganic activity that we alluded to, both today as it relates to the integration of Kantar but also how we think about putting the balance sheet to work in the future. So we're happy with the progress in this space. We see some nice traction in the first half of the year around areas where we've made bets. And now we need it to go further faster for scale impact over the next 2, 4, 6 quarters."

We talk a lot about at the business group level about entrepreneurial scale. So when we have market strategies that are non-provider in their orientation, so when we're -- in selling to life sciences and pharma less relatively through Kantar, we imagine the level of autonomy around the operating model that allows them to move at pace and operate in a very different market with a very different buyer type. But we're also thinking about scale attributes and what it looks like to leverage some of the benefits of things like the investment that Jerome and Keith Jahn are making in the digital factory. And so that gives us scale attributes across all the platforms. and at the same time, allows us to be efficient in terms of how we think it costs the sale inside the enterprise space, but also to operate with a little bit more autonomy and flexibility in areas that are very different than our core provider market."

So we're -- I'm going to talk about what's improved. I've talked in the past. And these are matters of discipline and the matter of focus. I think that we're doing more in terms of how we're aligning to our clients. So we've mentioned earlier some of the actions we've taken. Those actions really, in my view, were to improve our client alignment. So we flattened out our client organization. We've tried to eliminate the number of touch points to our clients, to really be more strategic with how we engage with them. We think that's important not only to -- on a value retention level, but also to expand strategies that Don and team have noted prior. So better client alignment, our end-to-end delivery commitments are crucial. We not only sell in the client organization, but we deliver on our promises. And so we're really focused on how do we take our managed services, consulting and support businesses and deliver to our clients on an end-to-end basis to where we not just get to go-live, but we actually get there by meeting our commitments with good data insights along the entirety of that path. And so an end-to-end focus on delivery is also crucial for us as we continue to meet and keep client commitments. And then we have a set of I think, great tools and capabilities that we weren't getting to our clients, I think, in the most efficient manner. So we've got data-driven insights. We have a treasure trove of data through our lights on network. And we're working closely to develop comprehensive programming at a client level. So specific client strategic planning based on their needs and their value needs and then bringing the right tools and tool sets market-enabled to those clients. And we've done a lot of targeted work around blueprint activity in the clinical space around configuration evaluation around upgrades and uplifts. It's all of those things collectively together that improve the client experience. And I think we're in the -- we're heading in the right direction. That work is never done. There's always work to do to proceed in that area. But I like how we're thinking about it in a holistic manner, and I like how we're more strategic, I think, in our approach with clients individually. But we've got ways to go. And to your second half of your question, I think back to the earlier question, I like how we're competing. I like our focus. I think that winning in the market is driving value for our clients. And we know our clients' needs. I think we've got better market insights, working closely with our marketing organization. I think that we're improving the way that we think about sales enablement. And so as we work on our IP infrastructure, as we sharpen our product focus, we're also working on how do we generate demand and lead, but also how do we get to market more quickly as Brent noted, with Velocity. And so the work that we've been doing the last 3 years, frankly, is starting to come to fruition, and we've seen really good progress, as Don noted, with real-time health system. I think we'll campaign around remote patient monitoring, referral management. Key areas that are outside the traditional kind of EMR space that will really allow us to add more value, which makes us more productive with our clients and more competitive. And I'll just say our win rate is very good. I'm very happy with how we competed in the CommunityWorks on new footprints. Our global footprint is outstanding. Our teams are really competing well there. So good progress, lots to do. We're in a highly competitive environment. We've got a tough competitor, but we welcome the competition. It makes us better and we're seeking to get better and win every day."

And so once we find ourselves in a position to actually affect the sale then you'll start to see the benefit of that $10 million largely roll through.

And I know we had it in the prepared remarks, but I might just bear repeating here. In Q2, our gross margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, right? But despite the fact that gross margin compressed by 200 basis points, our adjusted operating margin was actually up by 220 right? That's a 400 basis point reversal in effect. Now only 30 of that came from divestitures, right? So a lot of this was just hard work being done by the team broadly speaking. As we think about the revenue plot going forward, one of the things that we're doing is we are also, like I said, strengthening our management reporting capabilities to allow us to have better understanding of the different growth vectors that we have organically. So we right now, are building out what I'll call, 16 fully allocated business group P&Ls within the company, which we never had before. We are going to be able to have 16 businesses that we have general managers effectively in charge of with full accountability with multifunctional resource teams that we can use for our planning processes. And right now, we are going through that process to build out our 3-year plan. We have a December due date with the Board, whereby we are going to share our fiscal '22, '23 and '24 plans at a level that we've never built them up before, right, with full involvement across the full entire broad-based leadership team so that we have clear revenue bridges and everything else that goes along with it. So I think us taking that step to get to the 16 internal fully allocated P&Ls for the business groups will be a big enabler for us as we think about where do we want to really drive a point of impact across the business itself. And that will then inform, I think, also our strategic M&A process because once we have a better understanding of what we can really expect internally, we have a better line of sight into what we might need to enhance our capabilities with respect to. So more to come on that. Certainly, we need time to build out that next 3-year plan at a very, very detailed level and I'm committed to doing that."

The attrition -- in terms of attrition, I'd say we've made vast improvements over where we've been over the last several years. I can't say specifically where we're at. But our net gains have been double digits in terms of our net on that. And it's also obviously been revenue-positive for us on the net versus attrition versus gain for the first half of the year. That's a good positive turn in trend for us. The last 3 or 4 years, as many of you know, were tough for us, and we had some downward momentum on that.

So we have a set of provider organizations that participate in our Learning Health Network. So we're targeting 80 participants by the end of the year. We're well on path based on first half performance, including 6 new clients in Q2, who have said, hey, we want to participate in research-related economics. That drives a couple of different kind of business model opportunities for us. One, we have some partner economics that sit in that strategy related to our partnership and investment with Elligo. So they have to do some work often. If you're not IUH or you're not Banner with the UFAA asset or you're not MedStar with Georgetown, those midsized provider organizations have to do some work around site readiness and what it looks like to be educated for how to participate, document and deal with audit-related realities of what it looks like to participate in the clinical trial. So we have some small economics associated with that. And then, yes, we're creating trial opportunities with our Kantar business where we're going in and engaging with life sciences and pharma, those top 25 players and bringing those opportunities back to those learning health network members, and we're actually sharing in those economics around that research activity. And then finally, Kantar obviously has a stand-alone set of businesses that predate their integration into Cerner that include, as Allan alluded to, strategic consulting work that are the final component of the business model."

But also, candidly, in terms of some of the public sector work that Travis is driving in terms of what it looks like to fulfill the needs, the DoD, the VA and really imagine what it would be like to do it at scale.

This morning, I'm going to start by sharing a bit about myself and why I chose to join Cerner. Then I'll provide some early observations in areas of focus. 
For 30 years, my career has been making health care more accessible, more understandable, more equitable and more affordable. Early in my career, I developed a strong conviction that focusing on the patient is the only way to be successful. This was true at UCLA where our focus on patient satisfaction was foundational to an operational and financial turnaround. As such, this patient-first philosophy has underpinned my approach to everything. 
At Geisinger, once we establish the patient as being the center of everything we do, we were able to expand that focus to the entire community. Having an integrated care and payment model, we showed that health care can be of the highest quality and affordable. We also created the world's largest biobank of whole exome sequencing because we knew that in that DNA with information, we could use to keep our community healthy. 
As part of extensive use of technology at Geisinger, I built an important relationship with Google, which ultimately led to an opportunity to run Google Health. I am proud of the work we did there on Search, YouTube, Maps. We provided the world with timely and authoritative medical information including our work on COVID, COVID symptoms, vaccines, community mobility reports, exposure notifications and more. Our YouTube COVID Information Page had over 500 billion impressions. 
We worked in partnership with Ascension to help organize disparate medical records, including Cerner's, so that nurses, doctors and other caregivers could easily find information about their patients. 
Now transitioning to Cerner, I feel that I've left an amazing tech company that was playing a role in health and joined an amazing health company that is using tech to improve people's lives. I'd like to share initial observation. 
Cerner than frankly, other electronic health record companies, have done a good job of automating processes and digitizing medical records for more than 40 years. By itself, that's a huge accomplishment. But it's very important that we acknowledge the fact that we haven't reached our full potential. 
Digitized records, for one, need to be more usable and provide actionable information. They need to be measured by how they enable caregivers to spend more time at the bedside and less time at the terminal. Improving the usability of Cerner Solutions is at the top of my list of things to get done. And usability is just the beginning, not the true promise of the digital age. 
HR need to do a better job of helping patients avoid unnecessary tests and medications, of helping clinicians avoid errors and suggest what treatments may work best, allowing us to understand the health of our communities, those at risk and what interventions are working. They also need to be predictive so we can prevent unnecessary admissions and readmissions. They need to help identify risks and conditions before they become chronic. And potentially, help the world avoid or at least minimize the effects of the next pandemic. 
Achieving these improvements will also require industry cooperation and compliance with interoperability requirements, something Cerner has been and will remain passionate about. The pipes are laid, which is wonderful, but we must make it easier to get the right information to the right people at the right time. 
Cerner has made good progress at improving the flow of information, gleaning insights from data and helping optimize the coordination of care through offerings like analytics, registries, referrals and real-time health. These capabilities remain important to our clients' and to Cerner's growth, and we will continue to enhance them as we fortify the EHR. 
We also continue to believe the potential of harnessing data to accelerate discovery and the deployment of therapies and ultimately improve patient outcomes. We have a great opportunity to do this through Cerner Enviza, which combines the expertise of the Cerner and Kantar Health teams. 
Something else I've heard plenty about is how important it is that Cerner make enhancements to our revenue cycle solution. We need to simplify billing for patients and providers, and that starts with making the billing more integrated and seamless. We think the RevElate Patient Accounting offering we announced during our health conference earlier this month will do just that. 
Importantly, as we work together to strengthen our solutions and make them more dependable, we have an opportunity to improve job satisfaction for caregivers who are increasingly burned out by the complexity and inefficiency inherent in today's EHRs. I know this focus will strengthen our client relationships and reduce client attrition. We are going to set reasonable expectations with our clients and meet them. This will require discipline and focus. 
In the past, Cerner has tried to do too many things, often by ourselves. Going forward, we're going to change that approach and only focus on a small number of important high-value areas, some of which we plan to achieve by partnering with highly capable organization we can -- we believe can help us achieve our mission of improving the lives of others. This new approach will provide the best and most efficient path to engage clients, providers and patients as well as the best way for Cerner to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth. 
The current leadership team has done a lot of good work to address this ahead of my arrival. Their progress is showing up in improved performance with clients and strong financial results. For example, Jerome Labat, our Chief Technology Officer, has made progress on platform modernization, advancing our approach to development. This is critical to driving needed R&D efficiencies, improving quality, increasing the speed at which we get capabilities to our clients and lowering the cost of running and supporting our products. 
Travis Dalton, our Chief Client and Service Officer, continues to grow our Federal business, while simultaneously strengthening our client and services organization. Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resource Officer, has helped Cerner navigate a period of significant change while driving improvements in compensation practices, associate satisfaction, and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. 
And since joining earlier this year, Mark Erceg has quickly created and put in place new management reporting capabilities that are helping us make more informed decisions relative to our CapEx spending, R&D investments, product portfolio, partnership arrangements and our operating structure. Mark has also helped expand our adjusted operating margin and improved free cash flow. We're making better use of our balance sheet by increasing our share repurchase program. 
While I've been pleased with my direct leadership team, I've also been wildly impressed by the passion and enthusiasm of my 25,000-plus Cerner associates. I've already had numerous interactions that make it clear to me that they understand our job is much bigger than digitizing records. I believe Cerner is well positioned to better serve patients, create meaningful value across health care and drive long-term profitable growth. 
All of Cerner has already taken important initial steps toward better execution and focus, and this is showing up in our business results. A big piece of that has been our success with the federal business, which Mark will now discuss before he provides a customary financial update. 
Thanks. Mark?"

Our Federal business remains solid, with the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard continuing to deploy their Cerner-powered EHR. For example, in August, the Coast Guard specific wave went live, bringing with it an additional 14 clinics and 17 base located in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii and Washington State. In addition, at the end of September, the DoD experienced another successful deployment, expanding their footprint by 4,800 end users across 130 locations in Hawaii. The DoD is now using Cerner solutions in 17 states over 1,000 locations and serving around 64,000 end users. Together, we are on pace to meet their full deployment schedule on time and on budget by the end of calendar year 2023. 
Moving to Veterans Affairs. In July, VA officials released the findings of their 12-week strategic review. Throughout the review, the VA Secretary remained committed to Cerner, and we remain committed to the Secretary and all of America's veterans. During that same month, our team also worked with VA leadership and providers at Manned Grand Staff Medical Center to implement additional capabilities as we continue providing seamless care for our nation's veterans. And just last month, we secured additional VA funding to support deployments to future locations. 
Now moving to our financial results. Overall, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Bookings were up 23% versus a year ago to $1.8 billion. Bookings this quarter included strong contributions from our Federal business and also reflect new footprints. That said, please note that some of the booking strength was the result of some larger transactions getting done in the third quarter that we had originally expected to transact in the fourth quarter. The strong bookings this quarter brings year-to-date bookings growth to 13%. 
Our revenue backlog also grew, ending the third quarter at $13.1 billion, which is up 1% versus a year ago. Revenue of $1.47 billion was up 7% over the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by strong growth in Federal and approximately $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition we completed earlier this year. 
Organic growth in the quarter was approximately 4%. Just like bookings, our revenue in the third quarter was a little bit stronger than our initial expectations with about 0.5 point of growth, which we originally expected to post in the fourth quarter, finding its way into the third quarter, driven by the bookings upside. 
Gross margin was down 20 basis points from a year ago at 82.9%, primarily due to a slightly higher mix of third-party services. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 150 basis points from 20.4% to 21.9% driven primarily by continued expense cost control, including the initial impact of the actions we discussed last quarter, namely, a reduction in force, the classification of several properties as held for sale and the write-down of certain in-process R&D for products that we deprecated as part of our drive to focus on the core, which David referenced during his remarks. 
Those actions were a good start, but we have identified and are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability as we work towards our goal of delivering a mid-20% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2024. For example, we continue to shrink our physical footprint as evidenced by the designation of 2 additional buildings as held for sale during the third quarter. These 2 buildings represent an additional 435,000 square feet of space bringing the total amount of square footage we have already sold or plan to disgorge up to 1.5 million square feet since the start of the year. 
We are continuing to critically review and evaluate our product set and take end-of-life decisions, so our R&D investment can be channeled towards the products with the highest return profiles. We are systematically reviewing our extensive list of partnerships, which currently number in the hundreds. While we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the top and bottom line performance of many of our partnerships, we also plan to reduce or eliminate some non-value-added arrangements so we can focus our precious resources on the most impactful or promising relationships. 
In addition, we recently completed a comprehensive analysis of third-party software and discover we are running over 750 unique titles, which currently cost us over $330 million annually for perpetual licenses, subscriptions and support. We will be taking concerted steps to actively manage and hopefully reduce this number and the associated cost going forward. 
I could continue, but let me comment on just one more area because I'm particularly excited about it. Over the past several years, and in large part because our client satisfaction has not been as high as it should be, it has been hard for Cerner to consistently pass along CPI escalators, which are embedded within many of our contracts. 
Going forward, as we take up David's challenge to focus on the patient and only do a few critically important things really well, we plan to stop or jettison side pursuits that, in many cases, have proven to be nothing but resource drains and distractions. As we do this, we should have an opportunity to strengthen our price integrity in the marketplace, which I believe has the potential to be a significant source of incremental and profitable revenue growth in the years ahead. 
So in summary, we've made good progress at improving margins this year and plenty of opportunities remain to help us achieve our goal of mid-20% adjusted operating margin by 2024. Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.86 per share, which is up nearly 20% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower tax rate and a lower share count. 
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $782 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $885 million last quarter, primarily driven by $375 million which we spent on share repurchases during the quarter. This brings our purchases through the end of the third quarter up to $1.1 billion. 
Our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q2 at $1.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $435 million. After $48 million of capital expenditures and $76 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $312 million, which is 32% higher than a year ago. Year-to-date free cash flow is $765 million, which is up 66% compared to the same period a year ago. 
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to grow upper mid-single digits compared to Q4 of 2020. This includes approximately $50 million of revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition, which is now part of Enviza, bringing fourth quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. This guidance also implies full year 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is consistent with our prior guidance. 
Organic growth for the year would also be in the mid-single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% over Q4 of 2020. The high end of this range would bring full year adjusted diluted EPS to $3.30 a share, which will be growth of about 16% over last year. Importantly, this is $0.05 higher than the full year guidance we provided last quarter and $0.15 higher than the midpoint of the original guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And I am very happy to communicate that we now expect to generate more than $950 million of free cash flow for the year. If achieved, that would be a new record amount breaking last year's $857 million, which was also a new record high at the time by roughly $100 million. 
Finally, we remain on track to purchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions, provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attractive both strategically and financially. 
In summary, I'm very pleased with how the entire Cerner team has been performing, which has directly contributed to our strong third quarter results and year-to-date results. I also want to take a moment to extend my warmest welcome to David and express my genuine excitement upon his arrival. 
David has quickly bonded with the entire Cerner family, connected with an impressive number of clients and sharpened Cerner's strategy and focus. We are all energized by David's presence and feel like all the pieces are quickly coming together, which we believe will, over time, allow Cerner to fully realize its significant potential to positively impact health care while also generating meaningfully higher levels of total shareholder return.

So I'll say a few things just about the financial profile, then I'll let David comment more fully on the strategy element. So at this point, we're really very pleased with how the integration is performing. I can tell you that versus the going-in acquisition economics, we're running about $2 million high on revenue and about $5 million high in both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating margin. We're actually running about 300 full basis points ahead of our plan as it related to that, and we're looking at an adjusted operating margin of roughly 19% at this point in time. 
So from a financial standpoint, this thing is playing out really very well. We feel really good about where we are. We're going to have about $130 million of full year revenue. And of course, that's a partial effect since we closed on the acquisition on April 1. And then as far as how we think about it more holistically, I'll turn that over to David."

And so what we've been doing is putting in all the piping so that we can have a real world-class management reporting system that's going to be based on a number of operating units that will have fully allocated P&Ls. That, I think, is going to enable us to drive our cost profile and frankly, operate more efficiently so that we can serve our patients and our clients better. 
A big part of that is then being able to drive operating efficiencies through all the processes that we are building out and that goes all the way through the R&D side of the house and to everything else that we're doing. And I think we're starting to see some early results and wins as it relates to that because when you understand your product level profitability, your client level profitability, your fully allocated operating unit profitabilities, you can make better decisions. 
So for example, for the past 5 years through fiscal 2020, we had our revenue growing roughly 4% per year, but our operating expenses were growing by 6%, right? During that time frame, we saw a 440 basis point contraction in our adjusted operating margin. And that's to be expected because you're 200 basis points to the bad when your expenses are growing 6% and your revenue is growing 4%. 
While fiscal year-to-date for 2021, our revenue has been growing 4.9%, our operating expenses have been growing 1.4%. So now we've increased our margin by 190 basis points on an adjusted basis year-to-date because we're operating 350 basis points to the good. That's a huge reversal of 550 basis points. The management reporting structures we're putting in place are allowing us to do that and do that efficiently and effectively. And I think that's critical to our long-term success. And that's why I'm so frankly confident that we're going to be able to get to the mid-20s by fiscal '24."

My sense is that when you lay off a person, you're actually not laying off a person. You oftentimes are infecting an entire family. So I like to multiply any layoff in my mind by 4 or 5 about how many people are being affected. And I think it's terrible. I think it oftentimes is a reflection of management not predicting where the business is going and getting folks retrained for areas of growth so that this stuff doesn't happen. 
We need to right the ship, and I think that's part of the process here. But in some ways, to me, it's been lack of discipline and lack of focus. Not only do layoffs affect the individuals and their families, it also affects those that remain at the organization because there's a survivor guilt and there's fear about what's coming next. So we will work our way through this. 
Going forward, we will be more disciplined about thinking about where our business is going and how we can retrain our folks to be best positioned to help us as we're going forward. There's no way we're going to shrink our way to greatness. So while these are some immediate measures, and I think they're corrective and I'm supportive of them, they don't fit with my philosophy going forward."

We now have a system in place that allows us to actively manage where those teams are signed and what the output from their work is. We do have a meaningful investment in that area, it's about $800 million a year. I would expect, as we think about our modeling that, that $800 million will probably stay relatively constant for the next couple of years, but I wouldn't expect it to increase necessarily. 
And as we continue to grow the top line, I would expect R&D as a percent of sales then to drop. I mean, for us to get to mid-20s adjusted operating margin by fiscal '24, we can't continue to spend R&D as a percent of sales at the rates we've been spending in the past. Now the good news is, I think as we continue to spend roughly $800 million a year, we're going to get a whole lot more for it. The automation tool that Jerome is putting in place, the digital factory that he's standing up, the simple fact that we're going to be a lot more disciplined and focused about where we put our scrum teams and what we expect them to generate and produce is going to, I think, be somewhat revolutionary around here. 
So I'm very, very excited. I think we can get a lot more traction with the same amount of spending or potentially even a little less over time, certainly as a percent of sales."

Yes, we've had quite a bit of discussion with the team since I've been here over the last few weeks around this particular area. So I don't know that I have the perfect words to describe it, but I'll do -- I'll tell you where we're at. And I think it starts to make sense. To me, we need to make the EHR reliable and usable. And when I say make the EHR reliable and usable, when I say that, that, of course, in my mind, means -- and that means billing works, too. So I described the EHR of today, it's not only the digital record, but the ability to conduct a business that's needed for health systems all over. 
And that same EHR in my mind, also needs to be a tool that allows grandma's blood sugar to get to where it needs to get to. So it has to be interoperable. It has to have, on top of it, analytics that you can make predictions around individual patients, around communities. You have to be able to use that EHR in a way that allows you to be successful in a fee-for-service or fee-for-value model. So that's the list of what we're doing. 
When I say fixed the EHR, to me, it's broader than what Millennium does right now, but it's really parts of Millennium or all of Millennium along with what we've done around billing in addition to the population health tools, the predictive tools that are so important in today's ecosystem of taking care of people. 
And then we have actually -- you asked the second question to Mark, but I'm going to answer it. You also asked for the list of what are the things we're not doing. We kind of went down that rabbit hole. And what we came to is instead of saying that, what we're going to say is, here are the things we're doing. And if it's not on the list, that means we're not doing it. 
So what we're doing is fixing the EHR to make it usable, make it reliable, make sure that the billing works and make sure it has on top of it that layer that allows information to flow freely so that patients and families can get the information where they need to get it. So that's the list of what we're doing and everything else is on the do not do list."

I think one thing that's really important for us on the client retention side is that we have a lot of extension and expansion opportunity inside of our client base. And we have better insights into those activities. I think we're getting to our clients sooner than we were before because of some of the hard work we've done to run the business with more data and discipline.

Last time we talked a lot about the write-down of the capitalized R&D, the designation of a number of properties as held for sale and then the reduction in force that we effected last quarter. 
You'll recall that there was charges associated with each of those 3, it was $48 million, $68 million, $54 million, respectively. Those things at the time, combined for about $70 million worth of annualized savings. We put additional properties up for sale now. We do have an additional limited reduction in force that is being affected now. That's going to affect about 150 associates. You put those 2 things on top of it, that's another $20 million of annualized run rate savings. 
And it's also important to note that we really are trying to manage our cost takeout through attrition, wherever possible, to David's point earlier. And we are down literally 1,000 associates from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3. Now half of that was because of the reduction in force that we affected, the other half was from managing the attrition and managing that well. 
So we have a lot of things that we can do and a lot of things that we can deploy in order to get to that mid-20s by fiscal '24. And the software example is just another illustrative case of things where we spend a lot of money where we can do a lot better by just managing things tighter."

So my philosophy on population health, especially if you're not an organization that's been doing it for a long time, more than anything, it's a cultural shift. The data is really, really important, but it's about changing how you think about running your health system. So what we want to do, and I think Cerner was right early on thinking of this platform as a way to collect disparate data sets, including registries, including electronic health records, social determinants of health, genomic information. I mean, the more data, the better to be able to make those predictions and manage it. 
I don't know that we've executed very well. And what I think you see in the market are some point solutions that are probably beating us kind of head-to-head on some of those point solutions. But to fundamentally change health care, you need to have that broad view of everything that's going on. Otherwise there's a lot of incumbents to sort of push you out. 
So I think we are positioned if we execute well here to really be able to bring in multiple sources of information to allow our partners, those caregivers, not only to manage an individual patient, but to think about communities and populations in a way that allows them to think of hospitalizations as failures of outpatient care. And outpatient care is failures of home care, and home care is failures of self-care and community care, right? 
So if that -- but that is a cultural change, it's really important for us to get the data right and to help them with that. But the big lift is really in the mindset and thinking of not how many transplants did we do this month, but rather how many organs did we save this month. So it's a big shift. And I've been fortunate to be in systems where they've had long histories of doing that. And even in those integrated systems, there's often a pull toward the old way of doing things. 
So we think that -- or I think that the HealtheIntent was the right strategy I think we have to streamline it. Some of it is falling behind some of the competition, we'll bring it up to speed. And then I think it puts us in a great position to help, which is great because if we really achieve population health, we're talking about improving health for everyone really working on the equity issue. And we're also talking about decreasing the cost of care as well as improving the quality. So we're all in. We just need to figure out exactly how we take the HealtheIntent from today and get it more up to speed."

And so we need that kind of input and we'll build the -- our own internal team to make sure everything we're doing is synced up with our product folks and our engineering folks and that, that clinical person has a very, very important voice in that. As well as -- and I heard this over the last month as I've been visiting our customers, they want to help us. 
The folks that have picked Cerner as their electronic health record partner are actually very tied into our success as we are to theirs. And what they're saying to us is we have ideas and you haven't listened. So I think we need to be clinically focused here as we're building products and wide open to our current customers to make sure we're taking their feedback to improve it. 
And what it looks like means you're not clicking 70 times to get to Tylenol. It means you're not looking through a record to try to find, did somebody have a Pneumovax vaccine. It means that when you think about diabetes, the record says to you, well, yes, here's everything on diabetes. Oh, and by the way, there's no LDL on this patient. Have you thought about that? 
So that's what we're talking about usability, where you start -- where you currently, when you're a frontline doc or nurse and you're using our system or if I may be so bold to say any of the systems, there are so many things you need to do that send you a message that you don't matter. You become a data clerk. And all we're doing is trying to improve billing or documentation, but you don't matter as a clinician. 
We need to flip that on its head that says we've been thinking about you. We know the work you're going to need to be doing, and we've been anticipating that.

When you're looking for temperature, we pull all the temperatures together, including the tmax and the temperature over the last 36 hours. 
And when you're looking for things, it's not a record that's really just a compile cut and paste, but really about that story of that patient or that story about that community population. So that's what we mean by taking the noise out and really saying back to the doctors and nurses and pharmacists and social workers on the front line and care managers, we got your back.

We need to spread that around. Some clients are using really our OB product very well. There's clients that are using our care management tools really well and others saying, I'm having trouble with care management. So there's budget being out and about and listening to folks or med administration for nurses at the bedside. 
I've heard a lot of that. I've also heard about our HealtheIntent, where in the U.K., we use HealtheIntent to evaluate the population. And that team there found that for the flu, the -- having a risk factor of learning disabilities increase your chance of hospitalization for the flu 2 times greater than those that had COPD. 
So that's not something that I learned in med school. That's something that the data, and that was the team there using our HealtheIntent found that learning disabilities is a bigger predictor of hospitalization for the flu than a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Now that becomes actionable. And then they set up a flu clinic for people with learning disabilities. 92% of the folks came in to get the flu shots. 
And that not only decreases hospitalization and decreases cost. That saves lives. Now our job is to say, okay, that learning happened there. Now how do we set up flu clinics for people with learning disabilities all over the world, right? Because that will probably save more lives than I ever could do as an individual doc, I'm positive. 
So that's the promise of taking what some folks have done with our information and getting it out to everyone else. And I've only been here like 28 days or something like that. I know there's more out there, and we need to tap into that and we need to create that system without sharing of information is such that it really starts to accelerate really what we came here for is to make a lot of people's lives better when they get sick and to prevent a lot of people from getting sick."

This morning, I'm going to start by sharing a bit about myself and why I chose to join Cerner. Then I'll provide some early observations in areas of focus.  
For 30 years, my career has been making health care more accessible, more understandable, more equitable and more affordable. Early in my career, I developed a strong conviction that focusing on the patient is the only way to be successful. This was true at UCLA where our focus on patient satisfaction was foundational to an operational and financial turnaround. As such, this patient-first philosophy has underpinned my approach to everything.  
At Geisinger, once we establish the patient as being the center of everything we do, we were able to expand that focus to the entire community. Having an integrated care and payment model, we showed that health care can be of the highest quality and affordable. We also created the world's largest biobank of whole exome sequencing because we knew that in that DNA with information, we could use to keep our community healthy.  
As part of extensive use of technology at Geisinger, I built an important relationship with Google, which ultimately led to an opportunity to run Google Health. I am proud of the work we did there on Search, YouTube, Maps. We provided the world with timely and authoritative medical information including our work on COVID, COVID symptoms, vaccines, community mobility reports, exposure notifications and more. Our YouTube COVID Information Page had over 500 billion impressions.  
We worked in partnership with Ascension to help organize disparate medical records, including Cerner's, so that nurses, doctors and other caregivers could easily find information about their patients.  
Now transitioning to Cerner, I feel that I've left an amazing tech company that was a playing a role in health and joined an amazing health company that is using tech to improve people's lives. I'd like to share initial observation.  
Cerner and frankly, other electronic health record companies, have done a good job of automating processes and digitizing medical records for more than 40 years. By itself, that's a huge accomplishment. But it's very important that we acknowledge the fact that we haven't reached our full potential.  
Digitized records, for one, need to be more usable and provide actionable information. They need to be measured by how they enable caregivers to spend more time at the bedside and less time at the terminal. Improving the usability of Cerner solutions is at the top of my list of things to get done. And usability is just the beginning, not the true promise of the digital age.  
HR need to do a better job of helping patients avoid unnecessary tests and medications, of helping clinicians avoid errors and suggest what treatments may work best, allowing us to understand the health of our communities, those at risk and what interventions are working. They also need to be predictive so we can prevent unnecessary admissions and readmissions. They need to help identify risks and conditions before they become chronic. And potentially, help the world avoid or at least minimize the effects of the next pandemic.  
Achieving these improvements will also require industry cooperation and compliance with interoperability requirements, something Cerner has been and will remain passionate about. The pipes are laid, which is wonderful, but we must make it easier to get the right information to the right people at the right time.  
Cerner has made good progress at improving the flow of information, gleaning insights from data and helping optimize the coordination of care through offerings like analytics, registries, referrals and real-time health. These capabilities remain important to our clients' and to Cerner's growth, and we will continue to enhance them as we fortify the EHR.  
We also continue to believe the potential of harnessing data to accelerate discovery and the deployment of therapies and ultimately improve patient outcomes. We have a great opportunity to do this through Cerner Enviza, which combines the expertise of the Cerner and Kantar Health teams.  
Something else I've heard plenty about is how important it is that Cerner make enhancements to our revenue cycle solution. We need to simplify billing for patients and providers, and that starts with making the billing more integrated and seamless. We think the RevElate Patient Accounting offering, we announced during our health conference earlier this month will do just that.  
Importantly, as we work together to strengthen our solutions and make them more dependable, we have an opportunity to improve job satisfaction for caregivers who are increasingly burnt out by the complexity and inefficiency inherent in today's EHRs. I know this focus will strengthen our client relationships and reduce client attrition. We are going to set reasonable expectations with our clients and meet them. This will require discipline and focus.  
In the past, Cerner has tried to do too many things, often by ourselves. Going forward, we're going to change that approach and only focus on a small number of important high-value areas, some of which we plan to achieve by partnering with highly capable organization, we can -- we believe can help us achieve our mission of improving the lives of others. This new approach will provide the best and most efficient path to engage clients, providers and patients as well as the best way for Cerner to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth.  
The current leadership team has done a lot of good work to address this ahead of my arrival. Their progress is showing up in improved performance with clients and strong financial results. For example, Jerome Labat, our Chief Technology Officer, has made progress on platform modernization, advancing our approach to development. This is critical to driving needed R&D efficiencies, improving quality, increasing the speed at which we get capabilities to our clients and lowering the cost of running and supporting our products.  
Travis Dalton, our Chief Client and Service Officer, continues to grow our Federal business, while simultaneously strengthening our client and services organization. Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resource Officer, has helped Cerner navigate a period of significant change while driving improvements in compensation practices, associate satisfaction, and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.  
And since joining earlier this year, Mark Erceg has quickly created and put in place new management reporting capabilities that are helping us make more informed decisions relative to our CapEx spending, R&D investments, product portfolio, partnership arrangements and our operating structure. Mark has also helped expand our adjusted operating margin and improved free cash flow. We're making better use of our balance sheet by increasing our share repurchase program.  
While I've been pleased with my direct leadership team, I've also been wildly impressed by the passion and enthusiasm of my 25,000-plus Cerner associates. I've already had numerous interactions that make it clear to me that they understand our job is much bigger than digitizing records. 
I believe Cerner is well positioned to better serve patients, create meaningful value across health care and drive long-term profitable growth.  
All of Cerner has already taken important initial steps toward better execution and focus, and this is showing up in our business results. A big piece of that has been our success with the Federal business, which Mark will now discuss before he provides a customary financial update.  
Thanks. Mark?"

Our Federal business remains solid, with the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard continuing to deploy their Cerner-powered EHR. 
For example, in August, the Coast Guard specific wave went live, bringing with it an additional 14 clinics and 17 sick base located in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii and Washington State. In addition, at the end of September, the DoD experienced another successful deployment, expanding their footprint by 4,800 end users across 130 locations in Hawaii. The DoD is now using Cerner solutions in 17 states over 1,000 locations and serving around 64,000 end users. Together, we are on pace to meet their full deployment schedule on time and on budget by the end of calendar year 2023.  
Moving to Veterans Affairs. In July, VA officials released the findings of their 12-week strategic review. Throughout the review, the VA Secretary remained committed to Cerner, and we remain committed to the Secretary and all of America's veterans. During that same month, our team also worked with VA leadership and providers at Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center to implement additional capabilities as we continue providing seamless care for our nation's veterans. And just last month, we secured additional VA funding to support deployments to future locations.  
Now moving to our financial results. Overall, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Bookings were up 23% versus a year ago to $1.8 billion. Bookings this quarter included strong contributions from our Federal business and also reflect new footprints. That said, please note that some of the booking strength was the result of some larger transactions getting done in the third quarter that we had originally expected to transact in the fourth quarter. The strong bookings this quarter brings year-to-date bookings growth to 13%.  
Our revenue backlog also grew, ending the third quarter at $13.1 billion, which is up 1% versus a year ago. Revenue of $1.47 billion was up 7% over the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by strong growth in Federal and approximately $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition, we completed earlier this year.  
Organic growth in the quarter was approximately 4%. Just like bookings, our revenue in the third quarter was a little bit stronger than our initial expectations with about 0.5 point of growth, which we originally expected to post in the fourth quarter, finding its way into the third quarter, driven by the bookings upside.  
Gross margin was down 20 basis points from a year ago at 82.9%, primarily due to a slightly higher mix of third-party services. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 150 basis points from 20.4% to 21.9% driven primarily by continued expense cost control, including the initial impact of the actions we discussed last quarter, namely, a reduction in force, the classification of several properties as held-for-sale and the write-down of certain in-process R&D for products that we deprecated as part of our drive to focus on the core, which David referenced during his remarks.  
Those actions were a good start, but we have identified and are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability as we work towards our goal of delivering a mid-20% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2024. 
For example, we continue to shrink our physical footprint as evidenced by the designation of 2 additional buildings as held-for-sale during the third quarter. These 2 buildings represent an additional 435,000 square feet of space bringing the total amount of square footage we have already sold or plan to disgorge up to 1.5 million square feet since the start of the year.  
We are continuing to critically review and evaluate our product set and take end-of-life decisions, so our R&D investment can be channeled towards the products with the highest return profiles. We are systematically reviewing our extensive list of partnerships, which currently number in the hundreds. While we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the top and bottom line performance of many of our partnerships, we also plan to reduce or eliminate some non-value-added arrangements so we can focus our precious resources on the most impactful or promising relationships.  
In addition, we recently completed a comprehensive analysis of third-party software and discover we are running over 750 unique titles, which currently cost us over $330 million annually for perpetual licenses, subscriptions and support. We will be taking concerted steps to actively manage and hopefully reduce this number and the associated cost going forward.  
I could continue, but let me comment on just one more area because I'm particularly excited about it. Over the past several years, and in large part because our client satisfaction has not been as high as it should be, it has been hard for Cerner to consistently pass along CPI escalators, which are embedded within many of our contracts.  
Going forward, as we take up David's challenge to focus on the patient and only do a few critically important things really well, we plan to stop or jettison side pursuits that, in many cases, have proven to be nothing but resource drains and distractions. 
As we do this, we should have an opportunity to strengthen our price integrity in the marketplace, which I believe has the potential to be a significant source of incremental and profitable revenue growth in the years ahead.  
So in summary, we've made good progress at improving margins this year and plenty of opportunities remain to help us achieve our goal of mid-20% adjusted operating margin by 2024. Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.86 per share, which is up nearly 20% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower tax rate and a lower share count.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $782 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $885 million last quarter, primarily driven by $375 million which we spent on share repurchases during the quarter. This brings our purchases through the end of the third quarter up to $1.1 billion.  
Our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q2 at $1.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $435 million. After $48 million of capital expenditures and $76 million of capitalized software. Free cash flow came in at $312 million, which is 32% higher than a year ago. Year-to-date free cash flow is $765 million, which is up 66% compared to the same period a year ago.  
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to grow upper mid-single digits compared to Q4 of 2020. This includes approximately $50 million of revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition, which is now part of Enviza, bringing fourth quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. This guidance also implies full year 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is consistent with our prior guidance.  
Organic growth for the year would also be in the mid-single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% over Q4 of 2020. The high end of this range would bring full year adjusted diluted EPS to $3.30 a share, which will be growth of about 16% over last year. 
Importantly, this is $0.05 higher than the full year guidance we provided last quarter and $0.15 higher than the midpoint of the original guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.  
For the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And I am very happy to communicate that we now expect to generate more than $950 million of free cash flow for the year. If achieved, that would be a new record amount breaking last year's $857 million, which was also a new record high at the time by roughly $100 million.  
Finally, we remain on track to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions, provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attractive both strategically and financially.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with how the entire Cerner team has been performing, which has directly contributed towards strong third quarter results and year-to-date results. I also want to take a moment to extend my warmest welcome to David and express my genuine excitement upon his arrival.  
David has quickly bonded with the entire Cerner family, connected with an impressive number of clients and sharpened Cerner's strategy and focus. We are all energized by David's presence and feel like all the pieces are quickly coming together, which we believe will, over time, allow Cerner to fully realize its significant potential to positively impact health care while also generating meaningfully higher levels of total shareholder return.

A big part of that is then being able to drive operating efficiencies through all the processes that we are building out and that goes all the way through the R&D side of the house and to everything else that we're doing. 
And I think we're starting to see some early results and wins as it relates to that because when you understand your product level profitability, your client level profitability, your fully allocated operating unit profitabilities, you can make better decisions.  
So for example, for the past 5 years through fiscal 2020, we had our revenue growing roughly 4% per year, but our operating expenses were growing by 6%, right? During that time frame, we saw a 440 basis point contraction in our adjusted operating margin. And that's to be expected because you're 200 basis points to the bad when your expenses are growing 6% and your revenue is growing 4%.  
While fiscal year-to-date for 2021, our revenue has been growing 4.9%, our operating expenses have been growing 1.4%. So now we've increased our margin by 190 basis points on an adjusted basis year-to-date because we're operating 350 basis points to the good. That's a huge reversal of 550 basis points. The management reporting structures we're putting in place are allowing us to do that and do that efficiently and effectively. And I think that's critical to our long-term success. And that's why I'm so frankly confident that we're going to be able to get to the mid-20s by fiscal '24."

My sense is that when you lay off a person, you're actually not laying off a person. You oftentimes are infecting an entire family. So I like to multiply any layoff in my mind by 4 or 5 about how many people are being affected. And I think it's terrible. I think it oftentimes is a reflection of management not predicting where the business is going and getting folks retrained for areas of growth so that this stuff doesn't happen. 
We need to right the ship, and I think that's part of the process here. But in some ways, to me, it's been lack of discipline and lack of focus. Not only do layoffs affect the individuals and their families, it also affects those that remain at the organization because there's a survivor guilt and there's fear about what's coming next. So we will work our way through this. 
Going forward, we will be more disciplined about thinking about where our business is going and how we can retrain our folks to be best positioned to help us as we're going forward. There's no way we're going to shrink our way to greatness. So while these are some immediate measures, and I think they're corrective and I'm supportive of them, they don't fit with my philosophy going forward."

We now have a system in place that allows us to actively manage where those teams are signed and what the output from their work is. We do have a meaningful investment in that area, it's about $800 million a year. I would expect, as we think about our modeling that, that $800 million will probably stay relatively constant for the next couple of years, but I wouldn't expect it to increase necessarily. 
And as we continue to grow the top line, I would expect R&D as a percent of sales then to drop. I mean, for us to get to mid-20s adjusted operating margin by fiscal '24, we can't continue to spend R&D as a percent of sales at the rates we've been spending in the past. Now the good news is, I think as we continue to spend roughly $800 million a year, we're going to get a whole lot more for it. The automation tool that Jerome is putting in place, the digital factory that he's standing up, the simple fact that we're going to be a lot more disciplined and focused about where we put our scrum teams and what we expect them to generate and produce is going to, I think, be somewhat revolutionary around here. 
So I'm very, very excited. I think we can get a lot more traction with the same amount of spending or potentially even a little less over time, certainly as a percent of sales."

Yes, we've had quite a bit of discussion with the team since I've been here over the last few weeks around this particular area. So I don't know that I have the perfect words to describe it, but I'll do -- I'll tell you where we're at. And I think it starts to make sense. To me, we need to make the EHR reliable and usable. And when I say make the EHR reliable and usable, when I say that, that, of course, in my mind, means -- and that means billing works, too. So I described the EHR of today, it's not only the digital record, but the ability to conduct a business that's needed for health systems all over. 
And that thing EHR in my mind, also needs to be a tool that allows grandma's blood sugar to get to where it needs to get to. So it has to be interoperable. It has to have, on top of it, analytics that you can make predictions around individual patients, around communities. You have to be able to use that EHR in a way that allows you to be successful in a fee-for-service or fee-for-value model. So that's the list of what we're doing. 
When I say fixed the EHR, to me, it's broader than what Millennium does right now, but it's really parts of Millennium or all of Millennium along with what we've done around billing in addition to the population health tools, the predictive tools that are so important in today's ecosystem of taking care of people. 
And then we have actually -- you asked the second question to Mark, but I'm going to answer it. You also asked for the list of what are the things we're not doing. We kind of went down that rabbit hole. And what we came to is instead of saying that, what we're going to say is, here are the things we're doing. And if it's not on the list, that means we're not doing it. 
So what we're doing is fixing the EHR to make it usable, make it reliable, make sure that the billing works and make sure it has on top of it that layer that allows information to flow freely so that patients and families can get the information where they need to get it. So that's the list of what we're doing and everything else is on the do not do list."

I think one thing that's really important for us on the client retention side is that we have a lot of extension and expansion opportunity inside of our client base. And we have better insights into those activities. I think we're getting to our clients sooner than we were before because of some of the hard work we've done to run the business with more data and discipline. 
And so we have the opportunity to go to clients in a more proactive way versus a reactive way at a renewal time to: one, keep them; but two, drive value; and three, to continue the conversation of how we best serve them and the caregivers. And so we were able to move some things forward on the extensions. 
So we had some very large opportunities. We had a great opportunity in the Middle East side. We secured one of our biggest clients inside the U.S. at MedStar, which is a great client of ours.

Last time we talked a lot about the write-down of the capitalized R&D, the designation of a number of properties as held-for-sale and then the reduction in force that we effected last quarter. 
You'll recall that there was charges associated with each of those 3, it was $48 million, $68 million, $54 million, respectively. Those things at the time, combined for about $70 million worth of annualized savings. We put additional properties up for sale now. We do have an additional limited reduction in force that is being affected now. That's going to affect about 150 associates. You put those 2 things on top of it, that's another $20 million of annualized run rate savings. 
And then it's also important to note that we really are trying to manage our cost takeout through attrition, wherever possible, to David's point earlier. And we are down literally a 1,000 associates from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3. Now half of that was because of the reduction in force that we affected, the other half was from managing the attrition and managing that well.

And in a 5-year period, it switched from total license software being 1/3 recurring and 2/3 upfront to the reverse of that today. It's about 2/3 recurring. 
So because of that, you have less fluctuation in that upfront high-margin revenue. And as a result, you're going to have a little bit less fluctuation in your margins. So they can progress as you go through the year, which is what our Q4 guidance implies, that it will go up sequentially, but there's not necessarily some big onetime thing that's going to cause it to go up dramatically."

I guess, David, I would ask, how do you feel like Cerner is positioned here either as a provider of technology or as a provider of services, where we're seeing a lot of smaller companies make a lot of traction here and a lot of provider organizations, particularly in ambulatory space who kind of want to take this risk and manage this risk themselves?

So my philosophy on population health, especially if you're not an organization that's been doing it for a long time, more than anything, it's a cultural shift. The data is really, really important, but it's about changing how you think about running your health system. 
So what we want to do, and I think Cerner was right early on thinking of this platform as a way to collect disparate data sets, including registries, including electronic health records, social determinants of health, genomic information. I mean, the more data, the better to be able to make those predictions and manage it. 
I don't know that we've executed very well. And what I think you see in the market are some point solutions that are probably beating us kind of head-to-head on some of those point solutions. But to fundamentally change health care, you need to have that broad view of everything that's going on. Otherwise there's a lot of incumbents to sort of push you out. 
So I think we are positioned if we execute well here to really be able to bring in multiple sources of information to allow our partners, those caregivers, not only to manage an individual patient, but to think about communities and populations in a way that allows them to think of hospitalizations as failures of outpatient care. And outpatient care as failures of home care, and home care as failures of self-care and community care, right? 
So if that -- but that is a cultural change, it's really important for us to get the data right and to help them with that. But the big lift is really in the mindset and thinking of not how many transplants did we do this month, but rather how many organs did we save this month. 
So it's a big shift. And I've been fortunate to be in systems where they've had long histories of doing that. And even in those integrated systems, there's often a pull toward the old way of doing things. 
So we think that -- or I think that the HealtheIntent was the right strategy I think we have to streamline it. Some of it is falling behind some of the competition, we'll bring it up to speed. And then I think it puts us in a great position to help, which is great because if we really achieve population health, we're talking about improving health for everyone really working on the equity issue. 
And we're also talking about decreasing the cost of care as well as improving the quality. So we're all in. We just need to figure out exactly how we take the HealtheIntent from today and get it more up to speed."

And if it's clinically-infused, that nurse that's worked 40 years in the ER will go, hey, this makes my job worse. And then we won't build it that way, right? 
And so we need that kind of input and we'll build the -- our own internal team to make sure everything we're doing is synced up with our product folks and our engineering folks and that, that clinical person has a very, very important voice in that. As well as and I heard this over the last month as I've been visiting our customers, they want to help us. 
The folks that have picked Cerner as their electronic health record partner are actually very tied into our success as we are to theirs. And what they're saying to us is we have ideas and you haven't listened. So I think we need to be clinically focused here as we're building products and wide open to our current customers to make sure we're taking their feedback to improve it. 
And what it looks like means you're not clicking 70 times to get to Tylenol. It means you're not looking through a record to try to find, did somebody have a Pneumovax vaccine. It means that when you think about diabetes, the record says to you, well, yes, here's everything on diabetes. Oh, and by the way, there's no LDL on this patient. Have you thought about that? 
So that's what we're talking about usability, where you start -- where you currently, when you're a frontline doc or nurse and you're using our system or if I may be so bold to say any of the systems, there are so many things you need to do that send you a message that you don't matter. You become a data clerk. And all we're doing is trying to improve billing or documentation, but you don't matter as a clinician. 
We need to flip that on its head that says we've been thinking about you. We know the work you're going to need to be doing, and we've been anticipating that. So when you type a couple of letters, the auto-complete fills out what you're thinking about. Or when you're looking for temperature, we pull all the temperatures together, including the TMAX and the temperature over the last 36 hours. 
And when you're looking for things, it's not a record that's really just a compile cut and paste, but really about that story of that patient or that story about that community population. So that's what we mean by taking the noise out and really saying back to the doctors and nurses and pharmacists and social workers on the front line and care managers, we got your back. We're going to help you do your job."

There's clients that are using our care management tools really well and others saying, I'm having trouble with care management. So there's budget being out and about and listening to folks or med administration for nurses at the bedside. 
I've heard a lot of that. I've also heard about our HealtheIntent, where in the U.K., we use HealtheIntent to evaluate the population. And that team there found that for the flu, the -- having a risk factor of learning disabilities increase your chance of hospitalization for the flu 2 times greater than those that had COPD. 
So that's not something that I learned in med school. That's something that the data, and that was the team there using our HealtheIntent found that learning disabilities is a bigger predictor of hospitalization for the flu than a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. 
Now that becomes actionable. And then they set up a flu clinic for people with learning disabilities. 92% of the folks came in to get the flu shots. 
And that not only decreases hospitalization and decreases cost. That saves lives. Now our job is to say, okay, that learning happened there. Now how do we set up flu clinics for people with learning disabilities all over the world, right? Because that will probably save more lives than I ever could do as an individual doc, I'm positive. 
So that's the promise of taking what some folks have done with our information and getting it out to everyone else. And I've only been here like 28 days or something like that. I know there's more out there, and we need to tap into that and we need to create that system where that sharing of information is such that it really starts to accelerate really what we came here for is to make a lot of people's lives better when they get sick and to prevent a lot of people from getting sick."

This morning, I'm going to start by sharing a bit about myself and why I chose to join Cerner. Then I'll provide some early observations and areas of focus.  
For 30 years, my career has been making health care more accessible, more understandable, more equitable and more affordable. Early in my career, I developed a strong conviction that focusing on the patient is the only way to be successful. This was true at UCLA where our focus on patient satisfaction was foundational to an operational and financial turnaround. As such, this patient-first philosophy has underpinned my approach to everything.  
At Geisinger, once we establish the patient as being the center of everything we do, we were able to expand that focus to the entire community. Having an integrated care and payment model, we showed that health care can be of the highest quality and affordable. We also created the world's largest biobank of whole exome sequencing because we knew that in that DNA was information we could use to keep our community healthy.  
As part of extensive use of technology at Geisinger, I built an important relationship with Google, which ultimately led to an opportunity to run Google Health. I am proud of the work we did there on Search, YouTube, Maps. We provided the world with timely and authoritative medical information including our work on COVID, COVID symptoms, vaccines, community mobility reports, exposure notifications and more. Our YouTube COVID Information Page had over 500 billion impressions. We worked in partnership with Ascension to help organize disparate medical records, including Cerner's, so that nurses, doctors and other caregivers could easily find information about their patients.  
Now transitioning to Cerner, I feel that I've left an amazing tech company that was playing a role in health and joined an amazing health company that is using tech to improve people's lives. I'd like to share initial observation.  
Cerner and frankly, other electronic health record companies, have done a good job of automating processes and digitizing medical records for more than 40 years. By itself, that's a huge accomplishment. But it's very important that we acknowledge the fact that we haven't reached our full potential.  
Digitized records, for one, need to be more usable and provide actionable information. They need to be measured by how they enable caregivers to spend more time at the bedside and less time at the terminal. Improving the usability of Cerner solutions is at the top of my list of things to get done. And usability is just the beginning, not the true promise of the digital age.  
HRs need to do a better job of helping patients avoid unnecessary tests and medications, of helping clinicians avoid errors and suggest what treatments may work best, allowing us to understand the health of our communities, those at risk and what interventions are working. They also need to be predictive so we can prevent unnecessary admissions and readmissions. They need to help identify risks and conditions before they become chronic and potentially help the world avoid or at least minimize the effects of the next pandemic.  
Achieving these improvements will also require industry cooperation and compliance with interoperability requirements, something Cerner has been and will remain passionate about. The pipes are laid, which is wonderful, but we must make it easier to get the right information to the right people at the right time.  
Cerner has made good progress at improving the flow of information, gleaning insights from data and helping optimize the coordination of care through offerings like analytics, registries, referrals and real-time health. These capabilities remain important to our clients' and to Cerner's growth, and we will continue to enhance them as we fortify the EHR.  
We also continue to believe the potential of harnessing data to accelerate discovery and the deployment of therapies and ultimately improve patient outcomes. We have a great opportunity to do this through Cerner Enviza, which combines the expertise of the Cerner and Kantar Health teams.  
Something else I've heard plenty about is how important it is that Cerner make enhancements to our revenue cycle solution. We need to simplify billing for patients and providers, and that starts with making the billing more integrated and seamless. We think the RevElate Patient Accounting offering we announced during our health conference earlier this month will do just that.  
Importantly, as we work together to strengthen our solutions and make them more dependable, we have an opportunity to improve job satisfaction for caregivers who are increasingly burnt out by the complexity and inefficiency inherent in today's EHRs. I know this focus will strengthen our client relationships and reduce client attrition. We are going to set reasonable expectations with our clients and meet them. This will require discipline and focus.  
In the past, Cerner has tried to do too many things, often by ourselves. Going forward, we're going to change that approach and only focus on a small number of important high-value areas, some of which we plan to achieve by partnering with highly capable organization we can -- we believe can help us achieve our mission of improving the lives of others. This new approach will provide the best and most efficient path to engage clients, providers and patients as well as the best way for Cerner to deliver sustainable and profitable long-term growth.  
The current leadership team has done a lot of good work to address this ahead of my arrival. Their progress is showing up in improved performance with clients and strong financial results. For example, Jerome Labat, our Chief Technology Officer, has made progress on platform modernization, advancing our approach to development. This is critical to driving needed R&D efficiencies, improving quality, increasing the speed at which we get capabilities to our clients and lowering the cost of running and supporting our products. Travis Dalton, our Chief Client and Service Officer, continues to grow our Federal business, while simultaneously strengthening our client and services organization. Tracy Platt, our Chief Human Resource Officer, has helped Cerner navigate a period of significant change while driving improvements in compensation practices, associate satisfaction and diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. And since joining earlier this year, Mark Erceg has quickly created and put in place new management reporting capabilities that are helping us make more informed decisions relative to our CapEx spending, R&D investments, product portfolio, partnership arrangements and our operating structure. Mark has also helped us expand our adjusted operating margin and improved free cash flow. We're making better use of our balance sheet by increasing our share repurchase program.  
While I've been pleased with my direct leadership team, I've also been wildly impressed by the passion and enthusiasm of my 25,000-plus Cerner associates. I've already had numerous interactions that make it clear to me that they understand our job is much bigger than digitizing records. I believe Cerner is well positioned to better serve patients, create meaningful value across health care and drive long-term profitable growth. All of Cerner has already taken important initial steps toward better execution and focus, and this is showing up in our business results. A big piece of that has been our success with the Federal business, which Mark will now discuss before he provides a customary financial update. Thanks. Mark?"

Our Federal business remains solid, with the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard continuing to deploy their Cerner-powered EHR.For example, in August, the Coast Guard specific wave went live",1473,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Our Federal business remains solid, with the Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard continuing to deploy their Cerner-powered EHR.
For example, in August, the Coast Guard specific wave went live, bringing with it an additional 14 clinics and 17 sickbays located in Alaska, California, Guam, Hawaii and Washington State. In addition, at the end of September, the DoD experienced another successful deployment, expanding their footprint by 4,800 end users across 130 locations in Hawaii. The DoD is now using Cerner solutions in 17 states over 1,000 locations and serving around 64,000 end users. Together, we are on pace to meet their full deployment schedule on time and on budget by the end of calendar year 2023.  
Moving to Veterans Affairs. In July, VA officials released the findings of their 12-week strategic review. Throughout the review, the VA Secretary remained committed to Cerner, and we remain committed to the Secretary and all of America's veterans. During that same month, our team also worked with VA leadership and providers at Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center to implement additional capabilities as we continue providing seamless care for our nation's veterans. And just last month, we secured additional VA funding to support deployments to future locations.
Now moving to our financial results. Overall, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Bookings were up 23% versus a year ago to $1.8 billion. Bookings this quarter included strong contributions from our Federal business and also reflect new footprints. That said, please note that some of the booking strength was the result of some larger transactions getting done in the third quarter that we had originally expected to transact in the fourth quarter. The strong bookings this quarter brings year-to-date bookings growth to 13%. Our revenue backlog also grew, ending the third quarter at $13.1 billion, which is up 1% versus a year ago. 
Revenue of $1.47 billion was up 7% over the year-ago quarter, driven in large part by strong growth in Federal and approximately $45 million of incremental revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition we completed earlier this year. Organic growth in the quarter was approximately 4%. Just like bookings, our revenue in the third quarter was a little bit stronger than our initial expectations with about 0.5 point of growth, which we originally expected to post in the fourth quarter, finding its way into the third quarter, driven by the bookings upside.  
Gross margin was down 20 basis points from a year ago at 82.9%, primarily due to a slightly higher mix of third-party services. Adjusted operating margin, however, expanded 150 basis points from 20.4% to 21.9% driven primarily by continued expense cost control, including the initial impact of the actions we discussed last quarter, namely, a reduction in force, the classification of several properties as held-for-sale and the write-down of certain in-process R&D for products that we deprecated as part of our drive to focus on the core, which David referenced during his remarks. Those actions were a good start, but we have identified and are actively pursuing additional opportunities to improve profitability as we work towards our goal of delivering a mid-20% adjusted operating margin by fiscal 2024. 
For example, we continue to shrink our physical footprint as evidenced by the designation of 2 additional buildings as held-for-sale during the third quarter. These 2 buildings represent an additional 435,000 square feet of space bringing the total amount of square footage we have already sold or plan to disgorge up to 1.5 million square feet since the start of the year.  
We are continuing to critically review and evaluate our product set and take end-of-life decisions, so our R&D investment can be channeled towards the products with the highest return profiles. We are systematically reviewing our extensive list of partnerships, which currently number in the hundreds. While we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the top and bottom line performance of many of our partnerships, we also plan to reduce or eliminate some non-value-added arrangements so we can focus our precious resources on the most impactful or promising relationships.  
In addition, we recently completed a comprehensive analysis of third-party software and discover we are running over 750 unique titles, which currently cost us over $330 million annually for perpetual licenses, subscriptions and support. We will be taking concerted steps to actively manage and hopefully reduce this number and the associated cost going forward.  
I could continue, but let me comment on just one more area because I'm particularly excited about it. Over the past several years, and in large part because our client satisfaction has not been as high as it should be, it has been hard for Cerner to consistently pass along CPI escalators, which are embedded within many of our contracts. Going forward, as we take up David's challenge to focus on the patient and only do a few critically important things really well, we plan to stop or jettison side pursuits that, in many cases, have proven to be nothing but resource drains and distractions. As we do this, we should have an opportunity to strengthen our price integrity in the marketplace, which I believe has the potential to be a significant source of incremental and profitable revenue growth in the years ahead.  
So in summary, we've made good progress at improving margins this year and plenty of opportunities remain to help us achieve our goal of mid-20% adjusted operating margin by 2024. Wrapping up the P&L, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.86 per share, which is up nearly 20% over last year due to stronger adjusted operating earnings, a lower tax rate and a lower share count.  
Moving to our balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $782 million of cash and short-term investments, which is down from $885 million last quarter, primarily driven by $375 million which we spent on share repurchases during the quarter. This brings our purchases through the end of the third quarter up to $1.1 billion.  
Our quarter ending debt position was unchanged versus Q2 at $1.8 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $435 million. After $48 million of capital expenditures and $76 million of capitalized software, free cash flow came in at $312 million, which is 32% higher than a year ago. Year-to-date free cash flow is $765 million, which is up 66% compared to the same period a year ago.  
Moving to guidance. We expect revenue in Q4 to grow upper mid-single digits compared to Q4 of 2020. This includes approximately $50 million of revenue from the Kantar Health acquisition, which is now part of Enviza, bringing fourth quarter organic growth to the low to mid-single-digit range. This guidance also implies full year 2021 revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Organic growth for the year would also be in the mid-single-digit range. We expect fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% over Q4 of 2020. The high end of this range would bring full year adjusted diluted EPS to $3.30 a share, which will be growth of about 16% over last year. Importantly, this is $0.05 higher than the full year guidance we provided last quarter and $0.15 higher than the midpoint of the original guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.  
For the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And I am very happy to communicate that we now expect to generate more than $950 million of free cash flow for the year. If achieved, that would be a new record amount breaking last year's $857 million, which was also a new record high at the time by roughly $100 million.  
Finally, we remain on track to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of stock this year, which we believe will make better use of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow while still maintaining ample access to capital to fund high-return organic growth opportunities and potential future acquisitions, provided, of course, that those acquisitions are attractive both strategically and financially.  
In summary, I'm very pleased with how the entire Cerner team has been performing, which has directly contributed towards strong third quarter results and year-to-date results. I also want to take a moment to extend my warmest welcome to David and express my genuine excitement upon his arrival. David has quickly bonded with the entire Cerner family, connected with an impressive number of clients and sharpened Cerner's strategy and focus. We are all energized by David's presence and feel like all the pieces are quickly coming together, which we believe will, over time, allow Cerner to fully realize its significant potential to positively impact health care while also generating meaningfully higher levels of total shareholder return.

And so what we've been doing is putting in all the piping so that we can have a real world-class management reporting system that's going to be based on a number of operating units that will have fully allocated P&Ls. That, I think, is going to enable us to drive our cost profile and frankly, operate more efficiently so that we can serve our patients and our clients better. A big part of that is then being able to drive operating efficiencies through all the processes that we are building out and that goes all the way through the R&D side of the house and through everything else that we're doing. And I think we're starting to see some early results and wins as it relates to that because when you understand your product level profitability, your client level profitability, your fully allocated operating unit profitabilities, you can make better decisions.  
So for example, for the past 5 years through fiscal 2020, we had our revenue growing roughly 4% per year, but our operating expenses were growing by 6%, right? During that time frame, we saw a 440 basis point contraction in our adjusted operating margin. And that's to be expected because you're 200 basis points to the bad when your expenses are growing 6% and your revenue is growing 4%. While fiscal year-to-date for 2021, our revenue has been growing 4.9%, our operating expenses have been growing 1.4%. So now we've increased our margin by 190 basis points on an adjusted basis year-to-date because we're operating 350 basis points to the good. That's a huge reversal of 550 basis points. The management reporting structures we're putting in place are allowing us to do that and do that efficiently and effectively. And I think that's critical to our long-term success. And that's why I'm so frankly confident that we're going to be able to get to the mid-20s by fiscal '24."

So I like to multiply any layoff in my mind by 4 or 5 about how many people are being affected. And I think it's terrible. I think it oftentimes is a reflection of management not predicting where the business is going and getting folks retrained for areas of growth so that this stuff doesn't happen. We need to right the ship, and I think that's part of the process here. But in some ways, to me, it's been lack of discipline and lack of focus. Not only do layoffs affect the individuals and their families, it also affects those that remain at the organization because there's a survivor guilt and there's fear about what's coming next. So we will work our way through this. 
Going forward, we will be more disciplined about thinking about where our business is going and how we can retrain our folks to be best positioned to help us as we're going forward. There's no way we're going to shrink our way to greatness.

We now have a system in place that allows us to actively manage where those teams are signed and what the output from their work is. We do have a meaningful investment in that area, it's about $800 million a year. I would expect, as we think about our modeling that, that $800 million will probably stay relatively constant for the next couple of years, but I wouldn't expect it to increase necessarily. 
And as we continue to grow the top line, I would expect R&D as a percent of sales then to drop. I mean, for us to get to mid-20s adjusted operating margin by fiscal '24, we can't continue to spend R&D as a percent of sales at the rates we've been spending in the past. Now the good news is, I think as we continue to spend roughly $800 million a year, we're going to get a whole lot more for it. The automation tool that Jerome is putting in place, the digital factory that he's standing up, the simple fact that we're going to be a lot more disciplined and focused about where we put our scrum teams and what we expect them to generate and produce is going to, I think, be somewhat revolutionary around here. 
So I'm very, very excited. I think we can get a lot more traction with the same amount of spending or potentially even a little less over time certainly as a percent of sales."

So I don't know that I have the perfect words to describe it, but I'll do -- I'll tell you where we're at. And I think it starts to make sense. To me, we need to make the EHR reliable and usable. And when I say make the EHR reliable and usable, when I say that, that, of course, in my mind, means -- and that means billing works, too. So I describe the EHR of today as not only the digital record, but the ability to conduct a business that's needed for health systems all over. And that thing EHR in my mind also needs to be a tool that allows grandma's blood sugar to get to where it needs to get to. So it has to be interoperable. It has to have, on top of it, analytics that you can make predictions around individual patients, around communities. You have to be able to use that EHR in a way that allows you to be successful in a fee-for-service or fee-for-value model. So that's the list of what we're doing. 
When I say fixed the EHR, to me, it's broader than what Millennium does right now, but it's really parts of Millennium or all of Millennium along with what we've done around billing in addition to the population health tools, the predictive tools that are so important in today's ecosystem of taking care of people. 
And then we have actually -- you asked the second question to Mark, but I'm going to answer it. You also asked for the list of what are the things we're not doing. We kind of went down that rabbit hole. And what we came to is instead of saying that, what we're going to say is, here are the things we're doing. And if it's not on the list, that means we're not doing it. So what we're doing is fixing the EHR to make it usable, make it reliable, make sure that the billing works and make sure it has on top of it that layer that allows information to flow freely so that patients and families can get the information where they need to get it. So that's the list of what we're doing and everything else is on the do not do list."

We've been doing a really good job working through the client org on collections and managing any bad debt expense or anything else that would come along those ways. And that is giving us a lot of discretion then to do things like share repurchase and potentially future M&A, dividend increases and any number of other things. 
As far as how we think about using equity to incentivize and reward folks, look, we want everyone to have skin in the game, right? We want to have an ownership mentality across all the associates. That's important to me. That's important to David. It's important to the Board. And we certainly aren't going to do anything that gets us too far out over our skis, but we constantly monitor the marketplace for best pay practices.

We're doing that in all of our market segments. 
I think one thing that's really important for us on the client retention side is that we have a lot of extension and expansion opportunity inside of our client base. And we have better insights into those activities. I think we're getting to our clients sooner than we were before because of some of the hard work we've done to run the business with more data and discipline. And so we have the opportunity to go to clients in a more proactive way versus a reactive way at a renewal time to: one, keep them; but two, drive value; and three, to continue the conversation of how we best serve them and the caregivers. And so we were able to move some things forward on the extensions. 
So we had some very large opportunities. We had a great opportunity in the Middle East side. We secured one of our biggest clients inside the U.S. at MedStar, which is a great client of ours. And we also had really good Federal activity, and we had several task orders that came in that we were expecting early in our fourth quarter there, end of fiscal year.

Last time we talked a lot about the write-down of the capitalized R&D, the designation of a number of properties as held-for-sale and then the reduction in force that we effected last quarter. You'll recall that there was charges associated with each of those 3, it was $48 million, $68 million, $54 million, respectively. Those things at the time, combined for about $70 million worth of annualized savings. We put additional properties up for sale now. We do have an additional limited reduction in force that is being affected now. That's going to affect about 150 associates. You put those 2 things on top of it, that's another $20 million of annualized run rate savings. 
And then it's also important to note that we really are trying to manage our cost takeout through attrition, wherever possible, to David's point earlier. And we are down literally 1,000 associates from the end of Q2 to the end of Q3. Now half of that was because of the reduction in force that we affected, the other half was from managing the attrition and managing that well. 
So we have a lot of things that we can do and a lot of things that we can deploy in order to get to that mid-20s by fiscal '24. And the software example is just another illustrative case of things where we spend a lot of money, where we can do a lot better by just managing things tighter."

I guess my question is about population health and HealtheIntent, which I think a handful of years ago, we were expecting this to be a very large product, and we're seeing a lot of capital markets activity, a lot of provider activity around risk-taking and the various flavors of risk-taking. 
I guess, David, I would ask, how do you feel like Cerner is positioned here either as a provider of technology or as a provider of services, where we're seeing a lot of smaller companies make a lot of traction here and a lot of provider organizations, particularly in ambulatory space, who kind of want to take this risk and manage this risk themselves? I know Cerner had a plan at one point to offer a lot of services in this space, but I kind of would like to hear how you're thinking about that segment of the market."

So my philosophy on population health, especially if you're not an organization that's been doing it for a long time, more than anything, it's a cultural shift. The data is really, really important, but it's about changing how you think about running your health system. 
So what we want to do, and I think Cerner was right early on thinking of this platform as a way to collect disparate data sets, including registries, including electronic health records, social determinants of health, genomic information. I mean, the more data, the better to be able to make those predictions and manage it. 
I don't know that we've executed very well. And what I think you see in the market are some point solutions that are probably beating us kind of head-to-head on some of those point solutions. But to fundamentally change health care, you need to have that broad view of everything that's going on. Otherwise, there's a lot of incumbents that sort of push you out. 
So I think we are positioned, if we execute well here, to really be able to bring in multiple sources of information to allow our partners, those caregivers, not only to manage an individual patient, but to think about communities and populations in a way that allows them to think of hospitalizations as failures of outpatient care and outpatient care as failures of home care and home care as failures of self-care and community care, right? So if that -- but that is a cultural change, it's really important for us to get the data right and to help them with that. But the big lift is really in the mindset and thinking of not how many transplants did we do this month, but rather how many organs did we save this month. 
So it's a big shift. And I've been fortunate to be in systems where they've had long histories of doing that. And even in those integrated systems, there's often a pull toward the old way of doing things. 
So we think that -- or I think that the HealtheIntent was the right strategy I think we have to streamline it. Some of it is falling behind some of the competition, we'll bring it up to speed. And then I think it puts us in a great position to help, which is great because if we really achieve population health, we're talking about improving health for everyone really working on the equity issue, and we're also talking about decreasing the cost of care as well as improving the quality. So we're all in. We just need to figure out exactly how we take the HealtheIntent from today and get it more up to speed."

And the best way to do that is to make sure that everything we're building is clinically infused. And if it's clinically infused, that nurse that's worked 40 years in the ER will go, hey, this makes my job worse. And then we won't build it that way, right? 
And so we need that kind of input and we'll build the -- our own internal team to make sure everything we're doing is synced up with our product folks and our engineering folks and that, that clinical person has a very, very important voice in that. As well as, and I heard this over the last month as I've been visiting our customers, they want to help us. 
The folks that have picked Cerner as their electronic health record partner are actually very tied into our success as we are to theirs. And what they're saying to us is we have ideas and you haven't listened. So I think we need to be clinically focused here as we're building products and wide open to our current customers to make sure we're taking their feedback to improve it. 
And what it looks like means you're not clicking 70 times to get to Tylenol. It means you're not looking through a record to try to find did somebody have a Pneumovax vaccine. It means that when you think about diabetes, the record says to you, well, yes, here's everything on diabetes. Oh, and by the way, there's no LDL on this patient. Have you thought about that? 
So that's what we're talking about usability, where you start -- where you currently, when you're a frontline doc or nurse and you're using our system or if I may be so bold to say any of the systems, there are so many things you need to do that send you a message that you don't matter. You become a data clerk. And all we're doing is trying to improve billing or documentation, but you don't matter as a clinician. 
We need to flip that on its head that says we've been thinking about you. We know the work you're going to need to be doing, and we've been anticipating that. So when you type a couple of letters, the auto-complete fills out what you're thinking about. Or when you're looking for temperature, we pull all the temperatures together, including the TMAX and the temperature over the last 36 hours. 
And when you're looking for things, it's not a record that's really just a compiled cut and paste, but really about that story of that patient or that story about that community population. So that's what we mean by taking the noise out and really saying back to the doctors and nurses and pharmacists and social workers on the front line and care managers, we got your back. We're going to help you do your job."

We need to spread that around. Some clients are using really our OB product very well. There's clients that are using our care management tools really well and others saying, I'm having trouble with care management. So there's budget being out and about and listening to folks or med administration for nurses at the bedside. 
I've heard a lot of that. I've also heard about our HealtheIntent, where in the U.K., we used HealtheIntent to evaluate the population. And that team there found that for the flu, the -- having a risk factor of learning disabilities increase your chance of hospitalization for the flu 2x greater than those that had COPD.
So that's not something that I learned in med school. That's something that the data, and that was the team there using our HealtheIntent, found that learning disabilities is a bigger predictor of hospitalization for the flu than a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Now that becomes actionable. And then they set up a flu clinic for people with learning disabilities. 92% of the folks came in to get the flu shots. 
And that not only decreases hospitalization and decreases cost. That saves lives. Now our job is to say, okay, that learning happened there. Now how do we set up flu clinics for people with learning disabilities all over the world, right? Because that will probably save more lives than I ever could do as an individual doc, I'm positive. 
So that's the promise of taking what some folks have done with our information and getting it out to everyone else. And I've only been here like 28 days or something like that. I know there's more out there, and we need to tap into that and we need to create that system where that sharing of information is such that it really starts to accelerate really what we came here for is to make a lot of people's lives better when they get sick and to prevent a lot of people from getting sick."
