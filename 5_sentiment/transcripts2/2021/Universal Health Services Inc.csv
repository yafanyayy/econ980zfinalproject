Thank you, James. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. During the conference call, we will be using words such a",1042,"Good morning. Thank you, James. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.60 for the fourth quarter of 2020. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected in the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.59 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had received approximately $417 million of funds from various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the Cares Act included in our reported and adjusted income for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is approximately $20 million -- $200 million, excuse me, and $413 million, respectively, of net revenues recorded in connection with these stimulus programs. 
For the full year of 2020, approximately $316 million of those revenues were attributable to our acute facilities and $97 million were attributable to our behavioral health facilities. In addition, during 2020, we received approximately $695 million of Medicare's accelerated payments, which had no impact on our earnings during the year. 
We have commenced the repayment process and anticipate the $695 million of funds will be repaid to the government in March or April of 2021. As previously disclosed, on September 27, 2020, we experienced an information technology incident, which resulted in the suspension of user access to our information technology applications in the United States. Our information technology applications were substantially restored, our acute and behavioral hospitals at various times in October 2020 on a rolling and/or staggered basis, and our facilities generally resume standard operating procedures at that time. 
We estimate that this incident had an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lost revenues, incremental recovery expenses and delayed coding and billing. We estimate that approximately $12 million of the unfavorable pretax income impact was experienced during the third quarter of 2020 and approximately $55 million was experienced during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we also continue to experience a material unfavorable impact on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic before giving effect to the revenues recorded in connection with the Cares Act and other governmental grants. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020 and which peaked in the first half of January of 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures declines in both acute and behavioral patient days, along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $2.36 billion during the full year of 2020 as compared to $1.438 billion during 2019. Included in our 2020 cash provided by operating activities was the $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which we plan to repay to the government very soon. We spent $731 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2020 as compared to $634 million during 2019. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 55 days during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 50 days during 2019. The increase was due in part to the coding and billing delays caused by the information technology incident. At December 31, 2020, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.9% as compared to 42% at December 31, 2019. 
During 2020, we opened 439 new beds in our existing acute and behavioral health hospitals and opened Canyon Creek Behavioral Health Hospital, a new 102-bed hospital in Temple, Texas. We also opened 3 new freestanding emergency departments, or FEDs, and expect to open 5 more in 2022 to bring our total number of FEDs to 22. We continue to grow our behavioral health joint venture portfolio and recently announced the opening of 2 more de novo facilities, the 102-bed Southeast behavioral hospital, a joint venture with Southeast Health located in Southeast Missouri and the 134 bed Clive Behavioral Health Hospital, a joint venture with Mercy 1 located in Clive, Iowa. 
During 2021, we expect to spend approximately $850 million to $1 billion on capital expenditures, which includes construction of a new 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had a little over $1.2 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1 billion revolving credit facility and our $450 million accounts receivable securitization program. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In light of our expectation that the COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease our Board of Directors have approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share to be made on March 31. We also plan to resume our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 pending Board of Director approval. 
Similarly, our 2021 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, assumes that the negative impact of the COVID virus will diminish in 2021. The pace of that recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision. But we assume the COVID impact will generally ease an increasing cadence throughout 2021. Mark and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

We are building a new hospital in Reno, Nevada, where we have an existing hospital. But obviously, this will expand our presence in that market as well as in the state-wide market of Nevada. That's probably $150 million of capital spend in 2021 by itself. I also highlighted the joint venture activity we have building a number of new de novo behavioral hospitals with mostly not-for-profit joint venture partners. That's consuming, I think, some incremental capital. And then FEDs and I think more broadly, investment in ambulatory services on the acute side are also consuming some incremental capital. Those, I think, are sort of the big areas where there's increased spending."

So I might think that the volume comes back also would have maybe a negative payer mix coming with it.

And as a consequence, emergency room volumes are down and elective and scheduled procedures are down from pre pandemic levels and patient days in both acute and behavioral are down from pre pandemic levels. And the business that's missing were absent, if you will, from the hospital is essentially, I think, the higher-margin business and the coded business is lower-margin business that is temporarily replaced in 2020. I think as the as the COVID volumes ease in 2021, as we expect they will. And I think as they have started to do so, I think you'll see more of a return to kind of a normal medical-surgical mix. On the acute side and more of a return or a rebound in behavioral patient base on the behavioral side. And revenue will begin to increase and margins will begin to increase. But as I noted in my previous comment, what we have experienced, particularly later in 2020 is really accelerated pressure on our labor force and and that pressure, I think, will ease slowly in 2021. But I think the revenue mix of patients will clearly be better in 2021. And as the labor supply sort of equalizes, I think our margins will also improve as the year continues."

So market share data is not as widely available in the behavioral space as it is in the acute space. But I think to the degree that it is available. We believe, for the most part, that we have maintained our market share. I think the other important metric that we look at internally, Kevin, is the amount of sort of express demand, we measure that in a number of ways. But we measure it in the primary way by sort of incoming inquiries, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, et cetera. And what we have generally noted in 2020 is that the level of intake or inquiries has remained rather strong. And what has really occurred, particularly, I think, later in the year, is more challenges for us to meet that demand either because of COVID patients in our behavioral facilities, that preclude us from admitting non-COVID patients proxy for them on their units on their floors, whatever, or because we've got a significant chunk of our labor force that either has been exposed to the virus or has the virus or is out for some other alcohol virus-related reason, and we simply can't sort of operate all of our beds in a particular hospital or a particular geography at a point in time. To your sort of question about comparing to our public peer, difficult for me to do that because I just don't know what their experience has been with co to patients in their markets, what their protocol is for treating and isolating and keeping their cogitate and employees safe. I just don't know. So really, all we can do for the most part is look at what's impacting us internally. And I think we have a strong belief that the biggest impact on our behavioral volumes in 2020 has been COVID and COVID-related dynamics. And when those dynamics ease in 2021, behavioral volumes should resume to prepandemic levels. And quite frankly, we believe potentially higher than pre pandemic levels because we think that the underlying demand for behavioral care has been increasing."

We did so with the sort of basic underlying presumption that 2020 was kind of a lost year that we were mostly focused on dealing with the pandemic, keeping our patients safe, getting them well, keeping our employee base safe and well. Those were all extraordinary challenges. And in many ways, I think 2020 was otherwise a lost year in terms of business development, really taking advantage of capacity expansion, service line expansion, that sort of thing. And so when we began to think about a 2021 forecast, we really kind of started with our original 2020 value and what our forecast has been for 2020 and I think that's really largely true for both business segments. So I think we have a point of view that both business segments will sort of grow off of, if you will, a 2019 pre pandemic base at kind of mid-single-digit levels, et cetera, although it will be in a trajectory that I think is different from what's the normal or historical trajectory so that historically, Q1 is our biggest earnings quarter. And we earn more in the first half of the year than we do in the second half of the year, I think we have a point of view that 2021 will look differently because of this dynamic of COVID volumes declining as the year goes on. And revenue increasing and labor pressures easing and margins increasing as the year goes on. So I think the 2 business segments sort of grow in that historical mid-single-digit range.

So on the first point, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a significant surge in COVID volumes in December. On a percentage basis, we had more COVID patients in December of 2020 than any other month of the year. And that surge continued in almost all of our hospitals into the first half of January. I think COVID volumes tended to peak for virtually all of our hospitals in the first half of January. And have been declining and declining rather rapidly, and I think we view that as an encouraging sign since then. But again, one of the things that we've noted several times during the year and during the ebbs and flows of the pandemic is as COVID volumes surge and that pressures crowds out other business when the volumes drop, that other business returns, but it's not an immediate and instantaneous sort of thing. So I think it takes -- depending on the hospital and the service line, et cetera, weeks maybe month or 2 for that to happen. That's the expectation. And again, I think we're encouraged by the fact that the COVID volumes seem to have peaked. In the first half of January, and the hope is that, obviously, as the vaccine becomes more widely available and distributed, those trends will continue. To your question on the storms, and I would make the point that I think the storms affected a broad swath of the country, not just Texas, but in our case, Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee. I think the good news is that because these storms were sort of widespread, unlike things like the cyber incident where we face the risk and face the actual dynamic of during a relatively short period of time, business went elsewhere because we were struggling with our systems. During the weather event, everybody in our geographies was struggling in much the same way. And so I don't think we lost business to anybody else. I think because it occurred in the middle of a quarter, the likelihood that the business sort of recovers a week or 2 or 3 weeks later is more likely and my guess, and it's clearly a guess at this point is that when we get to the end of the first quarter, the weather event. Other than some incremental expenses and things which -- and many of which will be covered by insurance, shouldn't have a big impact."

And we've attributed that, at least to some degree, to a change in behavior on the part of some of our insurers and managed care companies. Clearly, and this trend certainly continued into the fourth quarter, we see the level of charity Care and the level of denials down about 10% from prior year comparisons. And there may be a number of reasons for that. But I think to some degree, it certainly is attributable to less aggressive utilization management behavior on the part of some of our insurers, at least. We also have negotiated during the year some measurable contractual price increases, particularly in our Managed Medicaid portfolio. These are not big increases, but I think they come on top of a number of years of relatively suppressed price increases in that space. So that's been helpful as well. And I think, by the way, much needed, again, we've gone, at least with some payers, for a number of years without increases, that can be a difficult population to treat with some incremental expenses, et cetera. So I think they are -- those increases are justified, but that's been helpful as well. I would say on the acute side, not as much changed during the pandemic in terms of our managed care or insurance behavior one way or the other. Not in terms of renegotiating prices or in terms of utilization management behavior, et cetera, I would say it's mostly business as usual."

As far as the public health emergency timing, but more so the sort of the 20% DRG add-on. I'll make the point that we've benefited from the DRG add-on, but only to the degree that it's covering increased cost. So I think we've not made an explicit assumption about it in our 2021 budget. But what we really assume is that as COVID volumes decline, COVID expenses will decline. And we assume that as that occurs, the government at some point will lift the 20% add-on. So we haven't really, again, made an explicit assumption about that. It's really more built into our broader assumption that as the year progresses, acuity and revenue per adjusted admission will come down but so is expenses."

So we've not historically given out our call volume, et cetera. I don't know that any of our peers do anything like that. But I will say, repeat again, the notion that the call volume itself has not declined. And that's what leads us to believe that the underlying demand hasn't really changed.

I think we had talked for the last several years about the fact that labor shortages have impacted the 2 divisions somewhat differently. On the acute side, the impact has been what I would describe as more traditional, that is elevated labor costs, we're spending more money on overtime for our own employees. We're spending more money on temporary and traveling nurses and those sorts of things and paying shift differentials and sign-on bonuses and all that sort of thing. And I think it's really been exacerbated during the last year because the COVID has created all sorts of different and new dynamics and pressures. First of all, it has created a number of instances where employees, nurses and other clinicians are out sick. They have the virus, and they've been exposed to the virus, although that's often -- they're being exposed and contracting the virus outside of the hospital. But they're either way, they're on the sidelines for a period of time or they don't have the virus, but they've been exposed and they're quarantining or there's certainly been some element of burnout that we've all read about. It's been a very trying and difficult environment for clinicians to work in, and some have just, I think, decided to either step aside or try and work in less risky, less stressful environments. And then sort of at the other end of the spectrum, we know that there are significant numbers of employees who have been chasing premium work dollars. Nurses who want to and are willing to relocate and willing to work 6 ships a week or whatever can make 4 or 5x their regular salary and some nurses have certainly taken advantage of that opportunity. So all those expenses are reflected, I think, in our increased salary and wage expense on the acute side. On the behavioral side, as I've mentioned, I think, a number of times already on the call, the impact manifests itself somewhat differently. We do have a somewhat elevated level of labor expense. But the real impact is just the sheer inability to find sufficient numbers of clinicians, especially nurses, and therefore, an inability to accept as many qualified patients as we could either wise. And so it's reflected in kind of lower volumes rather than in elevated expense. And the notion is that, obviously, as the COVID virus eases in 2021, the dynamics that I talked about all start to reverse themselves. We don't have nearly as many nurses out. Many of our nurses and other employees are being vaccinated in real time. So that should be helpful. The level of burn out shoes, the ability of nurses to chase premium dollars elsewhere we'll diminish. All those things should get better as COVID volumes decline. And that's why we believe that the current labor pressure is somewhat transitory. Although again, as I noted, particularly about our first half 2021 guidance, it will take some time for that to develop and occur."

ER boxing visits went down, visits to private psychiatrists were down referrals from school systems were down in large part because inperson schooling was down significantly. And telehealth helps, I think, to augment some of those other activities. I think at the end of the day, the fundamental services that we provide, however, are not competitive with telehealth. If somebody calls a telehealth line and speaks with a clinician and expresses suicidal  ideation or homicidal thoughts or just sort of a lack of functionality in daily life. They're going to -- if it's the person on the other end, the clinician is in any way a responsible clinician, they're going to refer a person to more intensive care, whether that's inpatient care or partial hospitalization or outpatient care, but something more intensive than a telephone visit. And so we've spent a lot of the past years standing up our capabilities and building out our capabilities in telehealth so that we ourself can offer those services but also partnering with others who do, and I don't think we have any objection to the fact that others are doing it, but really trying to make sure that patients who are identified as needing further intensive care get it in the appropriate place. And obviously, we feel like our facilities, both in and outpatient are terribly appropriate. And most telehealth providers just are not in a position to really provide a significant amount of care beyond that initial assessment or kind of a traditional a 50-minute therapy session that you get in a private psychiatrist or therapists office. And those things are obviously going to continue. And they've existed before the pandemic, and they'll exist appropriately afterwards."

But also objectively, as we look at our service line volumes that there are people who have deferred care during the pandemic, and there's also evidence, and we've talked about this before, that there are people who when they come to the hospital are sicker and more acutely ill than they would have been had they come on a more timely basis. We're also hearing anecdotally from a lot of physicians at the current time they've got patients in their practice who are sort of queued up for elective sorts of procedures who are just waiting to get vaccinated. And as soon as they get vaccinated, they're willing to have that hip implant or an implant or other surgery that they may have delayed now to be perfectly fair, Jamie, we're unable to quantify that in any sort of specific way. It's not that I can tell you that we have x amount of this specific kind of surgery queued up for 2021. But what our 2021 guidance broadly assumes is that, again, as COVID volumes decline in 2021, non-COVID volumes increase. And elective and scheduled procedures get to pre pandemic levels by the back half of the year. And maybe there's even some catch-up and behavioral and acute patient base get to pre pandemic levels as the year goes on.

I mean, look, obviously, the Las Vegas market has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic because the gaming industry has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic and I think particularly target by the decline in airline travel, both domestically and internationally. We've been encouraged when the the gaming properties reopened, I think, in the June time frame, mostly to local business, meaning people in Nevada and Arizona and California who would drive to the properties. I think they reopened at 50% capacity. And there were many days when they were reaching those limits. And I think more recently, a number of the gaming properties I've read have expanded their capacity and are opening more days and then opening more services, restaurants, shows, whatever. So I think there is, again, I think all the comments that I made about our business and the gradual improvement in 2021, likely apply to the broader gaming and travel and leisure industry in Las Vegas. I'll make the same comments, however, that I made before, that, that precise pace of recovery is difficult for us to predict. I think broadly, we would say that we're still incredibly bullish on the Las Vegas market. We continue to invest new capacity in that market. We opened a tower at our new tower at our Centennial Hills Hospital this past year. We continue to expand our capacity in Henderson infection of the Las Vegas market, which has been a significant boom for us. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects in Las Vegas.

But as this sort of becomes a rolling program, I think the good news is that the comparison will not be as negative because we'll have just a number of facilities that are opening at any time. But I think more importantly, we're starting to see the first of those facilities mature and really get up to division wide or segment wide margins and in some cases, even better than that. And I think over the next few years, those projects will be a bit less of a drag and a bit more of a driver of growth. But you're right, in the early stages of the openings of these that they've been a drag.

Thank you, James. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. During the conference call, we will be using words such a",1040,"Good morning. Thank you, James. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.60 for the fourth quarter of 2020. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected in the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.59 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had received approximately $417 million of funds from various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act included in our reported and adjusted income for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is approximately $20 million -- $200 million, excuse me, and $413 million, respectively, of net revenues recorded in connection with these stimulus programs. 
For the full year of 2020, approximately $316 million of those revenues were attributable to our acute facilities and $97 million were attributable to our behavioral health facilities. In addition, during 2020, we received approximately $695 million of Medicare's accelerated payments, which had no impact on our earnings during the year.
We have commenced the repayment process and anticipate the $695 million of funds will be repaid to the government in March or April of 2021. As previously disclosed, on September 27, 2020, we experienced an information technology incident, which resulted in the suspension of user access to our information technology applications in the United States. Our information technology applications were substantially restored at our acute and behavioral hospitals at various times in October 2020 on a rolling and/or staggered basis, and our facilities generally resumed standard operating procedures at that time. 
We estimate that this incident had an unfavorable pretax impact of approximately $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lost revenues, incremental recovery expenses and delayed coding and billing. We estimate that approximately $12 million of the unfavorable pretax income impact was experienced during the third quarter of 2020 and approximately $55 million was experienced during the fourth quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we also continued to experience a material unfavorable impact on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic before giving effect to the revenues recorded in connection with the CARES Act and other governmental grants. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020, which peaked in the first half of January of 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures, declines in both acute and behavioral patient days, along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $2.36 billion during the full year of 2020 as compared to $1.438 billion during 2019. Included in our 2020 cash provided by operating activities was the $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which we plan to repay to the government very soon. We spent $731 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2020 as compared to $634 million during 2019. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 55 days during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 50 days during 2019. The increase was due in part to the coding and billing delays caused by the information technology incident. At December 31, 2020, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.9% as compared to 42% at December 31, 2019. 
During 2020, we opened 439 new beds in our existing acute and behavioral health hospitals and opened Canyon Creek Behavioral Health Hospital, a new 102-bed hospital in Temple, Texas. We also opened 3 new freestanding emergency departments, or FEDs, and expect to open 5 more in 2022 to bring our total number of FEDs to 22. We continue to grow our behavioral health joint venture portfolio and recently announced the opening of 2 more de novo facilities, the 102-bed Southeast Behavioral Hospital, a joint venture with SoutheastHEALTH located in Southeast Missouri and the 134-bed Clive Behavioral Health Hospital, a joint venture with MercyOne located in Clive, Iowa. 
During 2021, we expect to spend approximately $850 million to $1 billion on capital expenditures, which includes construction of a new 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had a little over $1.2 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity, pursuant to our $1 billion revolving credit facility and our $450 million accounts receivable securitization program. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In light of our expectation that the COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available, and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease, our Board of Directors have approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share to be made on March 31. We also plan to resume our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021, pending Board of Director approval. 
Similarly, our 2021 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, assumes that the negative impact of the COVID virus will diminish in 2021. The pace of that recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision, but we assume the COVID impact will generally ease and increase in cadence throughout 2021. 
Marc and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

I also highlighted the joint venture activity we have, building a number of new de novo behavioral hospitals with mostly not-for-profit joint venture partners.

And as a consequence, emergency room volumes are down and elective and scheduled procedures are down from pre-pandemic levels, and patient days in both acute and behavioral are down from pre-pandemic levels. 
And the business that's missing, were absent, if you will, from the hospital is essentially, I think, the higher-margin business and the COVID business is lower-margin business that is temporarily replaced in 2020. I think as the COVID volumes ease in 2021, as we expect they will, and I think as they have started to do so, I think you'll see more of a return to kind of a normal medical-surgical mix on the acute side and more of a return or a rebound in behavioral patient base on the behavioral side. And revenue will begin to increase and margins will begin to increase. But as I noted in my previous comment, what we have experienced, particularly later in 2020, is really accelerated pressure on our labor force, and that pressure, I think, will ease slowly in 2021. 
But I think the revenue mix of patients will clearly be better in 2021. And as the labor supply sort of equalizes, I think our margins will also improve as the year continues."

So market share data is not as widely available in the behavioral space as it is in the acute space. But I think to the degree that it is available, we believe, for the most part, that we have maintained our market share. I think the other important metric that we look at internally, Kevin, is the amount of sort of express demand. We measure that in a number of ways, but we measure it in a primary way by sort of incoming inquiries, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, et cetera. 
And what we have generally noted in 2020 is that the level of intake or inquiries has remained rather strong. And what has really occurred, particularly, I think, later in the year, is more challenges for us to meet that demand either because of COVID patients in our behavioral facilities that preclude us from admitting non-COVID patients, proxy for them on their units on their floors, whatever, or because we've got a significant chunk of our labor force that either has been exposed to the virus or has the virus or is out for some other, I'll call virus-related reason, and we simply can't sort of operate all of our beds in a particular hospital or a particular geography at a point in time. 
To your sort of question about comparing to our public peer, difficult for me to do that because I just don't know what their experience has been with COVID patients in their markets, what their protocol is for treating and isolating and keeping their COVID patients and employees safe, I just don't know. So really, all we can do for the most part is look at what's impacting us internally. And I think we have a strong belief that the biggest impact on our behavioral volumes in 2020 has been COVID and COVID-related dynamics. And when those dynamics ease in 2021, behavioral volumes should resume to pre-pandemic levels. And quite frankly, we believe potentially higher than pre-pandemic levels because we think that the underlying demand for behavioral care has been increasing."

I mean, honestly, Ralph, I think when we commenced the process of developing our 2021 budget or forecast, we did so with the sort of basic underlying presumption that 2020 was kind of a lost year that we were mostly focused on dealing with the pandemic, keeping our patients safe, getting them well, keeping our employee base safe and well. Those were all extraordinary challenges. And in many ways, I think 2020 was otherwise a lost year in terms of business development, really taking advantage of capacity expansion, service line expansion, that sort of thing. 
And so when we began to think about a 2021 forecast, we really kind of started with our original 2020 value and what our forecast has been for 2020. And I think that's really largely true for both business segments. So I think we have a point of view that both business segments will sort of grow off of, if you will, a 2019 pre-pandemic base at kind of mid-single-digit levels, et cetera, although it will be in a trajectory that I think is different from what's the normal or historical trajectory, so that historically, Q1 is our biggest earnings quarter and we earn more in the first half of the year than we do in the second half of the year. I think we have a point of view that 2021 will look differently because of this dynamic of COVID volumes declining as the year goes on, and revenue increasing and labor pressures easing and margins increasing as the year goes on. So I think the 2 business segments sort of grow in that historical mid-single-digit range, although in sort of a different cadence and a different trajectory than we would normally expect."

So on the first point, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a significant surge in COVID volumes in December. On a percentage basis, we had more COVID patients in December 2020 than any other month of the year, and that surge continued in almost all of our hospitals and into the first half of January. I think COVID volumes tended to peak for virtually all of our hospitals in the first half of January and have been declining, and declining rather rapidly, and I think we view that as an encouraging sign since then. 
But again, one of the things that we've noted several times during the year and during the ebbs and flows of the pandemic is as COVID volumes surge and that pressures and crowds out other business when the volumes drop, that other business returns, but it's not an immediate and instantaneous sort of thing. So I think it takes -- depending on the hospital and the service line, et cetera, weeks maybe month or 2 for that to happen. That's the expectation. And again, I think we're encouraged by the fact that the COVID volumes seem to have peaked in the first half of January. And the hope is that, obviously, as the vaccine becomes more widely available and distributed, those trends will continue. 
As to your question on the storms, and I would make the point that I think the storms affected a broad swath of the country, not just Texas, but in our case, Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee. I think the good news is that because these storms were sort of widespread, unlike things like the cyber incident where we faced the risk and faced the actual dynamic of, during a relatively short period of time, business went elsewhere because we were struggling with our systems. During the weather event, everybody in our geographies was struggling in much the same way. And so I don't think we lost business to anybody else. I think because it occurred in the middle of a quarter, the likelihood that the business sort of recovers a week or 2 or 3 weeks later is more likely. And my guess, and it's clearly a guess at this point, is that when we get to the end of the first quarter, the weather event, other than some incremental expenses and things, which -- and many of which will be covered by insurance, shouldn't have a big impact."

And we've attributed that, at least to some degree, to a change in behavior on the part of some of our insurers and managed care companies. Clearly, and this trend certainly continued into the fourth quarter, we see the level of charity care and the level of denials down about 10% from prior year comparisons. And there may be a number of reasons for that. But I think to some degree, it certainly is attributable to less aggressive utilization management behavior on the part of some of our insurers, at least. 
We also have negotiated during the year some measurable contractual price increases, particularly in our Managed Medicaid portfolio. These are not big increases, but I think they come on top of a number of years of relatively suppressed price increases in that space, so that's been helpful as well. And I think, by the way, much needed, again, we've gone, at least with some payers, for a number of years without increases, that can be a difficult population to treat with some incremental expenses, et cetera. So I think they are -- those increases are justified, but that's been helpful as well. 
I would say on the acute side, not as much changed during the pandemic in terms of our managed care or insurance behavior one way or the other, and not in terms of renegotiating prices or in terms of utilization management behavior, et cetera. I would say it's mostly business as usual."

And we assume that as that occurs, the government at some point will lift the 20% add-on. So we haven't really, again, made an explicit assumption about that.

And I think we attribute that, in large part, to our inability to literally put the patient in a bed, either because the bed itself is unavailable because it's proximate to a COVID patient or for multiple COVID patients, or because we don't have enough qualified clinical staff to staff those beds. 
So we've not historically given out our call volume, et cetera. I don't know that any of our peers do anything like that. But I will say, repeat, again, the notion that the call volume itself has not declined. And that's what leads us to believe that the underlying demand hasn't really changed.

I think we had talked for the last several years about the fact that labor shortages have impacted the 2 divisions somewhat differently. On the acute side, the impact has been what I would describe as more traditional, that is elevated labor costs. We're spending more money on overtime for our own employees. We're spending more money on temporary and traveling nurses and those sorts of things and paying shift differentials and sign-on bonuses and all that sort of thing. And I think it's really been exacerbated during the last year because COVID has created all sorts of different and new dynamics and pressures. First of all, it has created a number of instances where employees, nurses and other clinicians are out sick. They have the virus, and they've been exposed to the virus, although that's often -- they're often being exposed and contracting the virus outside of the hospital. But they're -- either way, they're on the sidelines for a period of time. Or they don't have the virus, but they've been exposed and they're quarantining, or there's certainly been some element of burnout that we've all read about. It's been a very trying and difficult environment for clinicians to work in, and some have just, I think, decided to either step aside or try and work in less risky, less stressful environments. 
And then sort of at the other end of the spectrum, we know that there are significant numbers of employees who have been chasing premium work dollars, nurses who want to and are willing to relocate and willing to work 6 shifts a week or whatever can make 4 or 5x their regular salary, and some nurses have certainly taken advantage of that opportunity. So all those expenses are reflected, I think, in our increased salary and wage expense on the acute side. 
On the behavioral side, as I've mentioned, I think, a number of times already on the call, the impact manifests itself somewhat differently. We do have a somewhat elevated level of labor expense. But the real impact is, just the sheer inability to find sufficient numbers of clinicians, especially nurses, and therefore, inability to accept as many qualified patients as we could otherwise. And so it's reflected in kind of lower volumes rather than in elevated expense. And the notion is that, obviously, as the COVID virus frequence eases in 2021, the dynamics that I talked about all start to reverse themselves. We don't have nearly as many nurses out. Many of our nurses and other employees are being vaccinated in real time, so that should be helpful. The level of burnout should ease. The ability of nurses to chase premium dollars elsewhere will diminish. All those things should get better as COVID volumes decline. And that's why we believe that the current labor pressure is somewhat transitory. Although again, as I noted, particularly about our first half 2021 guidance, it will take some time for that to develop and occur."

ER visits went down, visits to private psychiatrists were down, referrals from school systems were down in large part because in-person schooling was down significantly. And telehealth helps, I think, to augment some of those other activities. I think at the end of the day, the fundamental services that we provide, however, are not competitive with telehealth. If somebody calls a telehealth line and speaks with a clinician and expresses suicidal ideation or homicidal thoughts or just sort of a lack of functionality in daily life, they're going to -- if it's -- the person on the other end, the clinician is in any way a responsible clinician, they're going to refer a person to more intensive care, whether that's inpatient care or partial hospitalization or outpatient care, but something more intensive than a telephone visit. 
And so we've spent a lot of the past years standing up our capabilities and building out our capabilities in telehealth so that we, ourself, can offer those services, but also partnering with others who do. And I don't think we have any objection to the fact that others are doing it, but really trying to make sure that patients who are identified as needing further intensive care get it in the appropriate place. And obviously, we feel like our facilities, both in and outpatient are terribly appropriate. And most telehealth providers just are not in a position to really provide a significant amount of care beyond that initial assessment or kind of a traditional a 50-minute therapy session that you get in a private psychiatrist or therapist office. And those things are obviously going to continue. And they've existed before the pandemic, and they'll exist appropriately afterwards."

Look, I think it's a fair statement. I mean, we said it in the beginning, look, I think it has definitely had an impact that acute care emergency room visits are down across the country by somewhere between 20% and 30% routinely during the pandemic, and we do get a measurable number of referrals from acute care hospital emergency room. So I think that's an issue. Now again, I think telehealth to a degree, has replaced some of that activity. And we've done a lot to reach out to our communities to make sure that if people are reluctant to go to an emergency room or community mental health center, that they will reach out in some other way that they feel more comfortable, again, with a telephone call, et cetera. 
But again, I don't think -- which I think was the crust of the question, I don't think we believe that the increased presence of telehealth has really put a damper on that overall demand. Again, I'll go back to what I was saying before, we think the demand is there. Our biggest challenge, and we think it will ease some in 2021, is meeting that demand, having sufficient beds and sufficient personnel to meet that demand."

We have said throughout the pandemic that we do believe sort of both anecdotally, we hear this from lots of physicians, but also objectively, as we look at our service line volumes that there are people who have deferred care during the pandemic. And there's also evidence, and we've talked about this before, that there are people who, when they come to the hospital, are sicker and more acutely ill than they would have been had they come on a more timely basis. We're also hearing anecdotally from a lot of physicians at the current time they've got patients in their practice who are sort of queued up for elective sorts of procedures who are just waiting to get vaccinated. And as soon as they get vaccinated, they're willing to have that hip implant or knee implant or other surgery that they may have delayed. Now to be perfectly fair, Jamie, we're unable to quantify that in any sort of specific way. It's not that I can tell you that we have x amount of this specific kind of surgery queued up for 2021. But what our 2021 guidance broadly assumes is that, again, as COVID volumes decline in 2021, non-COVID volumes increase. And elective and scheduled procedures get to pre-pandemic levels by the back half of the year. And maybe there's even some catch-up, and behavioral and acute patient base get to pre-pandemic levels as the year goes on. And so that -- I think implicit in that assumption is that some of this deferred demand from 2020 resurfaces and is satisfied."

I mean, look, obviously, the Las Vegas market has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic because the gaming industry has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and I think particularly are hit by the decline in airline travel, both domestically and internationally. We've been encouraged, when the gaming properties reopened, I think, in the June time frame, mostly to local business, meaning people in Nevada and Arizona and California, who would drive to the properties. I think they reopened at 50% capacity. And there were many days when they were reaching those limits. 
And I think more recently, a number of the gaming properties I've read have expanded their capacity and are opening more days and then opening more services, restaurants, shows, whatever. So I think there is, again, I think all the comments that I made about our business and the gradual improvement in 2021, likely apply to the broader gaming and travel and leisure industry in Las Vegas. 
I'll make the same comments, however, that I made before, that, that precise pace of recovery is difficult for us to predict. I think, broadly, we would say that we're still incredibly bullish on the Las Vegas market. We continue to invest new capacity in that market. We opened a tower at our -- a new tower at our Centennial Hills Hospital this past year. We continue to expand our capacity in Henderson section of the Las Vegas market, which has been a significant boom for us. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects in Las vegas. Whether the next 3 months are difficult or 6 or 9 months, that's more, I think, difficult to say. But every confidence that, that market will fully recover and that our investment in that market will fully recover."

We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. 
During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the first quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.
During the first quarter of 2021, we received approximately $188 million of additional CARES Act grant funds. While we continue to experience residual effects from the COVID-19 virus, the net impact on lost revenues and incremental expenses in 2021 has not been nearly as severe as it was in 2020. And  consequently, we have begun the process of returning these $188 million in CARES Act funds to the federal government and expect that process to be completed shortly. As previously disclosed, we also returned $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments to the federal government in the first quarter of 2021.
As I noted during the first quarter of 2021, we continued to experience certain unfavorable impacts on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020, which peaked in the first half of January 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures in both acute and behavioral patient days along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages and shortages of clinical personnel.
Our cash generated from operating activities was $72 million during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $502 million during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the aforementioned repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments. We spent $247 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2021. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 55 days in the fourth quarter of 2020, as we recovered from the billing and collection delays we experienced in the fourth quarter as a result of our previously disclosed information technology incident. At December 31, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7%, as compared to 41.3% at March 31, 2020.
In light of our expectation that COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease. Our Board of Directors approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share made on March 31. The Board also approved the resumption of our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021.
We are pleased with our first quarter 2021 operating results, which were just slightly ahead of our internal forecast. The pace of the recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision, but we assume the COVID impact will generally ease at an increase in cadence throughout 2021 and we remain comfortable that we will achieve our full year 2021 earnings guidance. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Well, obviously, we've seen during the entire pandemic, our pricing was above -- well above historical levels. And the main driver of that has been the higher acuity of our COVID patient, to a lesser degree, our non-COVID patients as well as So I think some deferred care, et cetera, is driving higher pricing.
I think our pricing on particularly, our acute care pricing in quarter 1 was particularly high for a number of reasons. In the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that as a result of our IT event, our billing and collection activities were delayed. We saw an increased aging in our receivables, and that resulted in higher bad debt expense and lower net revenue based on our regular accounting conventions. We anticipated that we would recover some of that as we caught up on our billing and collection. And I think that did, in fact, occur in Q1, and I think we probably benefited to the tune of maybe $10 million or $15 million in that regard. I think that we also benefited from the presence of horse reimbursement. This is the government -- the federal government's reimbursement of noninsured or uninsured patients with the COVID diagnosis, I think -- which really there was very little of that in Q1 of last year, and that's another probably $15 million or $20 million. And then there's a small amount of state and local supplemental payments that we received in Q1, mostly related to the treatment of COVID patients, maybe $5 million to $10 million. So I think those items are the sort of nonrecurring -- or I said, nonrecurring but items that we had in that we didn't have in Q1 of last year."

And also, I think, quite importantly, labor pressures will ease And those pressures will be manifested in lower wage rate increases as well as the ability to treat more patients, particularly on the payroll side."

Look, I think, Kevin, that the notion is that the things that have driven the pressure on both our wage rates and just on the overall availability of mostly clinical, but in some cases, nonclinical personnel are things like the actual virus itself. During the last 12, 13 months, at any point in time, we've had employees who are sidelined either with the virus itself or because they're being quarantined because of exposure to the virus. We've got employees who have suffered burn out, and there's been a lot written about that. We've got employees who are, quite frankly, chasing premium dollars elsewhere, where hospitals are paying really sort of extraordinary amounts because of the pressures of the pandemic, et cetera. I think our point of view is that, again, as more of our employees get vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer of them out as more and more of the general population gets vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer COVID patients There will be less burn out, there'll be a willingness of nurses and specialty nurses to return to the workplace. They won't have the opportunities to chase those premium dollars elsewhere, et cetera. To your sort of the crux of your point whether we return to the same sort of supply and demand balance of labor that we had pre-pandemic, hard to say. But certainly, I think we have a view that the labor pressures that we've experienced over the last 13 or 14 months should certainly ease measurably as we continue to recover from the virus."

And then I would say kind of late February, early March, we started to see measurable recovery, particularly in the acute business in elective and scheduled procedural volumes.
I think the good news about the weather is while it certainly had an impact in a broad geographic swath of our markets that included Texas and Oklahoma and Arkansas and Tennessee. Because it occurred largely, I think, in the middle of the quarter and because I think it was so widespread, it's not like we were really losing market share to competitors during that time. I think people were just staying home or stuck at home. And I think because they had 4 or 6 weeks to recoup whatever procedures they had missed. I think by the end of the quarter, the impact was not really significant. So at the end of the day for, I think, both the reason of the COVID decline in COVID volumes and the recovery from the weather events, clearly, March was we exited the quarter in March a lot more profitably than we began the quarter in January.

So I think -- and we've talked about this in previous calls. I think the dynamic the single dynamic that probably most separates our experience from our public acute care hospital peers is the percentage proportionately of COVID patients that we've treated. We've talked in the last few quarters about the fact that something like the low to mid-teens percentage of our admissions on the acute side have been COVID diagnosed patients. And I think our peers are either in the high single digits or maybe 8%, 9%, 10%. So that's a pretty significant difference. That affects a lot of things that I think it affects our cost structure, it affects our length of stay. And to your point, I think it also affects outpatient procedures and schedule, particularly scheduled and elective procedures, and it affects emergency room volume as well, which obviously a lot of that is outpatient ultimately. So I think that's probably the single biggest reason why our outpatient hasn't recovered as much.
And then your question about the weather is correct. I mean, I think weather events tend to affect outpatient more than inpatient because, obviously, if you have an urgent procedure, if you're having a heart attack or a stroke, you're still going to find your way to the emergency room. As opposed to if you're having hip surgery or knee surgery, whatever it may be. But again, I'm going to make the point that I think in the end, we recovered most of those deferred outpatient procedures by the end of the quarter."

So the point that we've made historically, and I would repeat because I think it's still valid is that medical patients in general are less profitable than surgical or procedural patients, COVID patients or medical patients. And therefore, I think that's equally true of them. The other issue is that COVID patients tend to be sicker. They're more acutely ill. They clearly have a longer length of stay than our regular medical patients. And that means that the costs associated with them are higher.
To your point about, I think, kind of developing treatments and protocols, I do think that clinically, we and I think all hospitals have gotten more adept and more efficient at treating COVID patients over the last 12, 13, 14 months, as you might expect. I think we learned a lot about what the right things and the wrong things are to do. But unfortunately, a lot of those more efficient and better clinical treatments are also very expensive. So things like remdesivir, one of the main drugs that are being used to treat cavitation are very expensive. And so again, this dynamic of the profitability of COVID patients versus non-COVID patients I think, still exists that is COVID are simply less profitable than the surgical and procedural patients that they have generally crowded out during the pandemic."

We've talked about pressures on labor really from the beginning of the pandemic. And I think most of our hospital company peers have done as well. I'm not sure we're all experiencing it in the same markets and to the same degree, but I think it certainly is a macro issue. Interestingly, we have said throughout that the labor shortage has manifested itself differently in our 2 business segments. I think on the acute side, we certainly have seen an increase in wage rates themselves. We see an elevated usage of over time and shift differential and usage of temporary traveling nurses all of which are measurably more expensive than our base wage rate for nurses and other clinical personnel.
On the behavioral side, if you measure it by salaries and wages per adjusted patient day, which I think is the right way of measuring, you'll see that the cost of labor isn't going up all that much. The real challenge is we just simply can't pay enough to get sufficient personnel in at least some of our hospitals in some of our markets. And so I would say that on the behavioral side, and I think you alluded to this in your question, shortage of appropriate clinical and in some cases, nonclinical personnel are probably the single biggest obstacle and headwind to getting back to pre-pandemic volumes and quite frankly, even above prepandemic volumes. And I can assure you that it's probably the -- I'm not saying probably, actually, I would say, most certainly, the single biggest focus of our operators as we turn our attention to what we need to do to both recruit and retain the proper amount of nurses, and that obviously includes proper pay rates that we're constantly doing compensation surveys to make sure that we're remaining competitive. We're looking at our processes for recruiting and hiring and our processes for mentoring new nurses and new graduates. All those sort of things are a focus of ours.
And we've made some progress. And I think as my earlier comments indicated, there's an expectation and then a hope that as the pandemic eases and the pressures of the pandemic ease, the labor pressures will ease as well and then some of the initiatives that we've been implementing will gain more traction."

So we measure that by the amount of incoming or inbound call traffic, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, et cetera.
And I think there's also macro information out there that suggests that the number of diagnose behavioral illnesses have continued to increase, and there's been a lot written about the fact that mental health stress, et cetera, has been greater during the pandemic for a variety of reasons.
And again, our biggest challenge throughout has really been our ability to satisfy that demand. And again, labor has probably been labor shortages have probably been the single biggest impediment to doing that. Now that tends to be very geography specific so that there are hospitals in which we do not have those issues, and we're seeing demand growing and volumes increasing. And then there are markets and geographies where we clearly see that taking place.
I think it's worth noting that in the markets where we tend to experience those problems, every, again, data point that we have suggests that our peers are experiencing those same issues in those geographies.

The percentage of our nursing hours that were being paid at premium rates were in the low double digits, 10%, 11%, 12%, something like that. By the end of the quarter, I think those rates were maybe half of that.
And while that doesn't necessarily a shift of 500 or 600 basis points doesn't seem huge, I think that it's worth making the point that those premium hours are often being paid at 2x or 3x the rate of our regular hours. So the changes in the number of hours don't have to be all that significant to really start to drive volume changes. So to your last point, I think that we think that as those pressures ease and as the percentage of premium hours come down to more normalized historical levels, they should have a beneficial impact on our margins because while I think our revenues will also come down because acuity will come down, I think that the incremental rate pressure is greater than decline in revenues that we would anticipate."

During the pand",423,"Yes. So I mean, I think what we've said over the course of the last several quarters is that sort of pre-pandemic, I think our behavioral pricing was increasing, on average, at about a 2% to 3% rate. based on revenue per adjusted day base. During the pandemic, that increase has been more like in the 5% or 6% range. I think some of that elevated level of pricing increase is due to a bit of an easing of pressure on the part of our managed care insurance payers. We're seeing fewer denials, less charity care during the pandemic. While we love if that behavior continued post-pandemic, I suspect that managed care behavior will become a little bit more aggressive as the pandemic eases.
On the other hand, some of that increase, I think, is more permanent in that we've gotten -- we've been, I think, much more focused and aggressive about obtaining increases from, particularly from some of our managed Medicaid payers from whom we have not had increases in quite some time. et cetera. And obviously, those are more sustainable.
So my gut is that once the pandemic eases some more that, that behavioral pricing increase will settle in somewhere in between the sort of 2 numbers that I gave before, maybe in that 3%, 4% range. So that will be a little bit higher than historical, but a little bit lower than where we've been running over the last several quarters.
And I think the same is generally true of length of stay. We've not seen a lot more transition to managed Medicaid during the pandemic. I don't know that it was an appropriate time for states to make big changes in their Medicaid programs. But also, as I think we've disclosed before, the vast majority of our Medicaid patients, certainly something like 3/4 of them are already in managed Medicaid programs. So I don't think we think that the impact of incremental or additional patients migrating to managed Medicaid will be that significant in the future. And I think we made this point in late 2019 and early in 2020, in January and February of 2020, what I would call prepandemic, length of stay have been leveling off, labor shortages had been leveling off, et cetera. And then the pandemic hits in mid-March of 2020 and the bottom sort of falls out. But I think we felt like we had made a lot of progress on those couple of issues prior to the pandemic really beginning to impact those."

So same thing on the acute care side.

It's different on the behavioral side. But that consideration is a big one for us.

We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. 
During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the first quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 
During the first quarter of 2021, we received approximately $188 million of additional CARES Act grant funds. While we continue to experience residual effects from the COVID-19 virus, the net impact on lost revenues and incremental expenses in 2021 has not been nearly as severe as it was in 2020. And consequently, we have begun the process of returning these $188 million in CARES Act funds to the federal government and expect that process to be completed shortly.  As previously disclosed, we also returned $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments to the federal government in the first quarter of 2021. 
As I noted during the first quarter of 2021, we continued to experience certain unfavorable impacts on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020, which peaked in the first half of January 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures in both acute and behavioral patient days along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages and shortages of clinical personnel. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $72 million during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $502 million during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the aforementioned repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments. We spent $247 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2021. 
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 55 days in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we recovered from the billing and collection delays we experienced in the fourth quarter as a result of our previously disclosed information technology incident.  At December 31, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 41.3% at March 31, 2020.  
In light of our expectation that COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease, our Board of Directors approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share made on March 31. The Board also approved the resumption of our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021.  
We are pleased with our first quarter 2021 operating results, which were just slightly ahead of our internal forecast. The pace of the recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision, but we assume the COVID impact will generally ease at an increase in cadence throughout 2021, and we remain comfortable that we will achieve our full year 2021 earnings guidance. 
We are pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Well, obviously, we've seen during the entire pandemic, our pricing was above -- well above historical levels. And the main driver of that has been the higher acuity of our COVID patient and, to a lesser degree, our non-COVID patients as well as I think some deferred care, et cetera, is driving higher pricing. 
I think our pricing, and particularly, our acute care pricing in quarter 1 was particularly high for a number of reasons. In the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that as a result of our IT event, our billing and collection activities were delayed. We saw an increased aging in our receivables, and that resulted in higher bad debt expense and lower net revenue based on our regular accounting conventions. We anticipated that we would recover some of that as we caught up on our billing and collection.  And I think that did, in fact, occur in Q1. 
And I think we probably benefited to the tune of maybe $10 million or $15 million in that regard. I think that we also benefited from the presence of HRSA reimbursement, this is the government's -- the federal government's reimbursement of noninsured or uninsured patients with the COVID diagnosis. I think -- which really there was very little of that in Q1 of last year, and that's another probably $15 million or $20 million. And then there's a small amount of state and local supplemental payments that we received in Q1, mostly related to the treatment of COVID patients, maybe $5 million to $10 million. 
So I think those items are the sort of nonrecurring -- or I shouldn't say nonrecurring, but items that we had in Q1 that we didn't have in Q1 of last year."

During the last 12, 13 months, at any point in time, we've had employees who are sidelined either with the virus itself or because they're being quarantined because of exposure to the virus. We've got employees who have suffered burnout, and there's been a lot written about that. We've got employees who are, quite frankly, chasing premium dollars elsewhere where hospitals are paying really sort of extraordinary amounts because of the pressures of the pandemic, et cetera. 
I think our point of view is that, again, as more of our employees get vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer of them out. As more and more of the general population gets vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer COVID patients, there'll be less burnout, there'll be a willingness of nurses and specialty nurses to return to the workplace. They won't have the opportunities to chase those premium dollars elsewhere, et cetera. 
To your sort of -- the crux of your point whether we return to the same sort of supply-and-demand balance of labor that we had prepandemic, hard to say. But certainly, I think we have a view that the labor pressures that we've experienced over the last 13 or 14 months should certainly ease measurably as we continue to recover from the virus."

So I talked about the COVID trends in my prepared remarks, Ralph, saying that in almost all of our hospitals, volume of COVID patients peaked in the first half of January and continued to level off as the quarter went on. And then I would say kind of late February, early March, we started to see measurable recovery, particularly in the acute business in elective and scheduled procedural volumes.
I think the good news about the weather is while it certainly had an impact in a broad geographic swath of our markets that included Texas and Oklahoma and Arkansas and Tennessee because it occurred largely I think in the middle of the quarter and because I think it was so widespread, it's not like we were really losing market share to competitors during that time. I think people were just staying home or stuck at home. And I think because they had 4 or 6 weeks to recoup whatever procedures they had missed. I think by the end of the quarter, the impact was not really significant. 
So at the end of the day for I think both the reason of the COVID -- decline in COVID volumes and the recovery from the weather events, clearly, March was -- we were -- we exited the quarter in March a lot more profitably than we began the quarter in January."

So I think -- and we've talked about this in previous calls. I think the dynamic -- the single dynamic that probably most separates our experience from our public acute care hospital peers is the percentage proportionately of COVID patients that we've treated. We've talked in the last few quarters about the fact that something like the low- to mid-teens percentage of our admissions on the acute side have been COVID-diagnosed patients. And I think our peers are either in the high single digits or maybe in the 8%, 9%, 10%. 
So that's a pretty significant difference. That affects a lot of things that I think it affects our cost structure, it affects our length of stay. And to your point, I think it also affects outpatient procedures and schedule, particularly scheduled and elective procedures, and it affects emergency room volume as well, which obviously a lot of that is outpatient ultimately. So I think that's probably the single biggest reason why our outpatient hasn't recovered as much.
And then your question about the weather is correct. I mean I think weather events tend to affect outpatient more than inpatient because, obviously, if you have an urgent procedure, if you're having a heart attack or a stroke, you're still going to find your way to the emergency room as opposed to if you're having hip surgery or knee surgery, whatever it may be. But again, I'm going to make the point that I think in the end, we recovered most of those deferred outpatient procedures by the end of the quarter."

So can you comment on the impact of your COVID census in the quarter on revenue per adjusted admission and also the EBITDA impact?"

So the point that we've made historically, and I would repeat because I think it's still valid, is that medical patients in general are less profitable than surgical or procedural patients, COVID patients or medical patients. And therefore, I think that's equally true of them. The other issue is that COVID patients tend to be sicker. They're more acutely ill. They clearly have a longer length of stay than our regular medical patients. And that means that the costs associated with them are higher.
To your point about I think kind of developing treatments and protocols, I do think that clinically, we and I think all hospitals have gotten more adept and more efficient at treating COVID patients over the last 12, 13, 14 months. As you might expect, I think we learned a lot about what the right things and the wrong things are to do. But unfortunately, a lot of those more efficient and better clinical treatments are also very expensive. So things like remdesivir, one of the main drugs that are being used to treat patients are very expensive. And so again, this dynamic of the profitability of COVID patients versus non-COVID patients I think still exists that is COVID patients are simply less profitable than the surgical and procedural patients that they have generally crowded out during the pandemic."

I think by the end of the quarter, as COVID volumes have declined pretty measurably, we were at 95% plus of prepandemic elective and surgical volumes.

You talked about some of the severe labor pressure where people are chasing -- workers are chasing those rates. Is that more of an issue on the acute side or the behavioral side? And are there any particular markets where you see that as being worse?
And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that the limiting factor in behavioral health care is, in fact, still labor, that the demand is higher than what you can serve given the labor pressure? And if that is true, do you -- how do you balance just sacrificing margin to get that incremental revenue in that higher levels of top line?"

We've talked about pressures on labor really from the beginning of the pandemic. And I think most of our hospital company peers have done as well. I'm not sure we're all experiencing it in the same markets and to the same degree, but I think it certainly is a macro issue. Interestingly, we have said throughout that the labor shortage has manifested itself differently in our 2 business segments. I think on the acute side, we certainly have seen an increase in wage rates themselves. We see an elevated usage of overtime and shift differential and usage of temporary traveling nurses, all of which are measurably more expensive than our base wage rate for nurses and other clinical personnel.
On the behavioral side, if you measure it by salaries and wages per adjusted patient day, which I think is the right way of measuring, you'll see that the cost of labor isn't going up all that much. The real challenge is we just simply can't pay enough to get sufficient personnel in at least some of our hospitals in some of our markets. 
And so I would say that on the behavioral side, and I think you alluded to this in your question, shortage of appropriate clinical and, in some cases, nonclinical personnel are probably the single biggest obstacle and headwind to getting back to prepandemic volumes and, quite frankly, even above prepandemic volumes. And I can assure you that it's probably the -- I'm not saying probably. Actually, I would say, most certainly, the single biggest focus of our operators as we turn our attention to what we need to do to both recruit and retain the proper amount of nurses, and that obviously includes proper pay rates, that we're constantly doing compensation surveys to make sure that we're remaining competitive. We're looking at our processes for recruiting and hiring and our processes for mentoring new nurses and new graduates, all those sort of things are a focus of ours.
And we've made some progress. And I think as my earlier comments indicated, there's an expectation and then a hope that as the pandemic eases and the pressures of the pandemic ease, the labor pressures will ease as well and then some of the initiatives that we've been implementing will gain more traction."

Pito, I think my response to Frank, to some degree, it covers this. Look, and I've said this before during the pandemic, every one of our internal data points and metrics indicates that volume continues to -- or demand, I should say, continues to increase at least at sort of prepandemic levels, if not, in many cases, above prepandemic levels. So we measure that by the amount of incoming or inbound call traffic, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, et cetera.  And I think there's also macro information out there that suggests that the number of diagnosable behavioral illnesses have continued to increase, and there's been a lot written about the fact that mental health stress, et cetera, has been greater during the pandemic for a variety of reasons.
And again, our biggest challenge throughout has really been our ability to satisfy that demand. And again, labor has probably been -- labor shortages have probably been the single biggest impediment to doing that. Now that tends to be very geography specific so that there are hospitals in which we do not have those issues, and we're seeing demand growing and volumes increasing. And then there are markets and geographies where we clearly see that taking place.
I think it's worth noting that in the markets where we tend to experience those problems, every, again, data point that we have suggests that our peers are experiencing those same issues in those geographies. So where we've had to cap or close beds because of the unavailability of clinical personnel, we know that there's evidence that our peers have had to do the same thing in those same geographies."

Pito, so I would say this. At the beginning of the quarter, the way we measure sort of the impact of the labor pressures on wage rates is we measure the percentage of our nursing hours, in particular, that are being paid at premium rates, things like overtime and registry and traveling nurses, et cetera. And I would say in the beginning of the quarter when our COVID volumes really peaked, the percentage of our nursing hours that were being paid at premium rates were in the low double digits, 10%, 11%, 12%, something like that. By the end of the quarter, I think those rates were maybe half of that.
And while that doesn't necessarily -- a shift of 500 or 600 basis points doesn't seem huge, I think that it's worth making the point that those premium hours are often being paid at 2 or 3x the rate of our regular hours. So the changes in the number of hours don't have to be all that significant to really start to drive volume changes. 
So to your last point, I think that we think that as those pressures ease and as the percentage of premium hours come down to more normalized historical levels, they should have a beneficial impact on our margins because while I think our revenues will also come down because acuity will come down, I think that the incremental rate pressure is greater than the decline in revenues that we would anticipate."

And then also where we are with the whole length of stay issue relative to Medicaid managed care?"

So I mean I think what we've said over the course of the last several quarters is that sort of prepandemic, I think our behavioral pricing was increasing, on average, at about a 2% to 3% rate based on revenue per adjusted day base. During the pandemi",425,"Yes. So I mean I think what we've said over the course of the last several quarters is that sort of prepandemic, I think our behavioral pricing was increasing, on average, at about a 2% to 3% rate based on revenue per adjusted day base. During the pandemic, that increase has been more like in the 5% or 6% range. I think some of that elevated level of pricing increase is due to a bit of an easing of pressure on the part of our managed care insurance payers. We're seeing fewer denials, less charity care during the pandemic. While we love if that behavior continued post pandemic, I suspect that managed care behavior will become a little bit more aggressive as the pandemic eases.
On the other hand, some of that increase I think is more permanent in that we've gotten -- we've been I think much more focused and aggressive about obtaining increases from -- particularly from some of our managed Medicaid payers from whom we have not had increases in quite some time, et cetera. And obviously, those are more sustainable.
So my gut is that once the pandemic eases some more that, that behavioral pricing increase will settle in somewhere in between the sort of 2 numbers that I gave before, maybe in that 3%, 4% range. So that will be a little bit higher than historical, but a little bit lower than where we've been running over the last several quarters.
And I think the same is generally true of length of stay. We've not seen a lot more transition to managed Medicaid during the pandemic. I don't know that it was an appropriate time for states to make big changes in their Medicaid programs. But also, as I think we've disclosed before, the vast majority of our Medicaid patients, certainly something like 3/4 of them are already in managed Medicaid programs. 
So I don't think we think that the impact of incremental or additional patients migrating to managed Medicaid will be that significant in the future. And I think we made this point in late 2019 and early in 2020, in January and February of 2020, what I would call prepandemic, length of stay have been leveling off, labor shortages had been leveling off, et cetera. And then the pandemic hits in mid-March of 2020 and the bottom sort of falls out. But I think we felt like we had made a lot of progress on those couple of issues prior to the pandemic really beginning to impact those."

But I noticed last year tended to drop off by about $20 million to $25 million in the second and third quarter. And it seemed like that was a bigger drop-off than you traditionally did prepandemic. Is there -- should we look for something seasonal pattern more like last year? Or is -- was that somehow driven by what happened with the pandemic and therefore, maybe it's -- it doesn't have the seasonal drop that we saw last year, but it's sort of more muted going forward?"

And that will play a big part in determining how interested we are.
So same thing on the acute care side. If we see something on acute, we would actually probably be more interested if there were synergies in markets where we already play as long as we didn't have FTC issues because we could build up our markets a little more. It's different on the behavioral side. But that consideration is a big one for us. And then obviously, the pricing and who else is in the market competing against us.

Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. 
During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.79 for the second quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.76 for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. In last night's press release, we identified 3 specific items, including supplemental Kentucky Medicaid reimbursements, an increase to our self-insured professional and general liability reserves, and the receipt of insurance proceeds. On a combined basis, these items had a net favorable impact on after-tax earnings of approximately $30 million during the second quarter of 2021. Even if one chooses to ignore the favorable impact entirely, our earnings during the quarter still exceeded our internal forecast by a wide margin. 
For most of the second quarter, we experienced a continued decline in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals and a corresponding recovery in the number of non-COVID patients. As a result, most of our key volume metrics, including acute and behavioral patient days, emergency room visits and surgical cases grew to levels approaching those that we were tracking before the pandemic began. This robust recovery in volumes exceeded the pace of our original forecast and drove the favorable operating results even in the face of continuing labor pressures in both of our business segments. Our cash generated from operating activities was $119 million during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $1.45 billion during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the previously announced early repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which were received by us during 2020 and repaid to the government during the first quarter of 2021. We spent $482 million on capital expenditures during the first 6 months of 2021. At June 30, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 38.3% at June 30, 2020. As previously announced, we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 after suspending it in April 2020 as the COVID volume surged for the first time. During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.21 million shares at an aggregate cost of $350 million. And yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, leaving $1.2 billion remaining authorization. We were extremely pleased with our second quarter 2021 operating results, which we noted were well ahead of our internal forecast. As a consequence, we also raised our full year earnings guidance, including an approximately 6% to 8% increase in our full year forecasted adjusted EBITDA. 
I would note that during the past 4 to 6 weeks, many of our hospitals have experienced significant surges in the number of COVID patients, and it is not evident that this surge has yet reached its peak. Given the uncertain impact of this most recent surge on non-COVID volumes and on labor shortages, we based our guidance for the second half of the year, primarily on our original internal forecast. 
Marc and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Well, Kevin, we've certainly discussed it for some time. I think we felt like before the pandemic began that the labor situation in our behavioral hospitals have largely stabilized from some of the challenges we've been having in the years before that. Obviously, the onset of the pandemic that have exacerbated and kind of created new challenges in terms of -- are finding sufficient numbers of therapists and nurses and mental health technicians who are nonprofessionals. For a variety of reasons, competition from telehealth providers, for therapists, nurses who were either burn out or contracting the virus or quarantining because they've been exposed to the virus or mental health technicians who we were competing with employers like Amazon or FedEx with. So a whole bunch of challenges, I think, during the pandemic. Again, I think as the pandemic eased in from its peaks early this year, I think the labor situation has been improving. And I think you saw that in Q2 with sequential improvement in our volumes and just a sort of a general stabilization of the behavioral business. Obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen an uptick in COVID patients in the last 4 to 6 weeks. I think it's a little too early to tell what sort of impact that's going to have on our ability to fill all of our open labor positions. And it's why, as I, again, made -- commented in my prepared remarks, we've been a little bit cautious about our guidance in the back half of the year."

We were also focusing a great deal on increasing retention rates for those people we do hire, but again, express some level of caution and concern with the rise in in COVID volumes in the last month or so only because every other time we've seen an increase in COVID patients, it does create an exacerbated pressure on those labor issues."

Every indicator that we have both on a sort of macro industry-wide basis and a micro UHS basis indicates that the demand is still growing. As I indicated, I think we felt that as the pandemic eased, a lot of those pressures were easing, not necessarily disappearing by any stretch, but easing. We didn't have -- nurses weren't as burned out, nurses weren't chasing those premium dollars. It just became easier to hire and to retain people. So I think that the COVID resurgence makes it a bit more challenging. But ultimately, we have a view that these shortages are temporary and transient in nature and when they get resolved, which I think will happen as the pandemic eases over time, we'll be able to get back to pre-pandemic volumes and ultimately see pre-pandemic volumes."

So I think we commented in Q1, we reached our -- the peak of our COVID levels, the third wave of COVID patients was sort of in late December 2020 and into January of 2021. Those were our highest COVID levels at almost all of our hospitals that we experienced during the pandemic. I would say beginning in the second half of January and then pretty steadily from there, COVID volumes declined and non-COVID volumes have recovered and rebounded. And as I indicated again in my prepared remarks to the point that by the time we exited Q2, for most of our volume metrics, we were back to sort of pre-pandemic and were sort of using 2019 as our measure of prepandemic levels of volumes. As I also indicated, we've seen COVID patients surge again beginning very late June and certainly well into July, and they don't appear to have peaked. Now what I will say is that our operators seem to be managing through this fourth wave of COVID very effectively. We certainly have seen a financial result since the COVID surge has resumed. But just from a volume metric perspective, we don't see that level of decline in things like elective surgeries or other activity that we've seen with other COVID surges. I think our operators are just much more accustomed to dealing with this, all of the sort of gating factors that have proved problematic in earlier surges, lack of PPE, lack of beds, lack of ventilators, those things, at least at the moment, don't exist. So we're coping much better. I do think probably the single biggest issue we will have with the resumption of COVID is just exacerbated pressure on labor. Every time that COVID frequency has increased, there's been more and more pressure on labor, and that's tough to measure. I mean, I think we know that we're using more temporary labor in July, but what the ultimate impact of that will be will have to play out. But at least so far through July, we seem to be coping reasonably well. However, as I indicated again in my prepared remarks, because we're sort of uncertain as to how this plays out and what the cadence will be, we've been cautious and haven't assumed that our financial results will sort of exceed our internal forecast in the back half of the year the way they did in Q2. And we've just sort of presumed that we'll meet our original guidance for the back half of the year for the most part."

We're seeing in a lot of our markets, fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients. We're seeing higher acuity of the patients we are treating. We've said, I think, from the beginning that the patients who sort of reluctant to come to the hospitals, driving softer emergency room activity, et cetera, tend to be lower acuity, Medicaid on insured patients. And so that mix obviously is reflected, albeit at lower volumes and higher revenue per unit, per adjusted admission, per adjusted patient day on both the acute and the behavioral side and increased earnings. So I think that's been generally a positive development and so positive that quite frankly, it has outweighed and even, I think, arguably overwhelmed the increased labor pressure that we've experienced. Now again, I'll caution that we may see a different dynamic in Q3 with higher levels of COVID patients, the mix may not be quite as favorable, but I think it was very favorable in Q2."

I think the fact of the matter is, and I think our second quarter results reflect this that the decline in COVID patients was more rapid than we originally anticipated and the recovery of non-COVID business was also correspondingly more rapid. And obviously, it led to second quarter results that were well ahead of our expectations. I think as we think about now the second half of the year, again, the most recent COVID surge sort of complicates that, and I don't know that where any of us are really insightful enough to know exactly how that will affect the ultimate trajectory for the rest of the year. But I think we have a point of view that some of the catch-up and recovery of those deferred procedures, et cetera, were realized in the second quarter that maybe we had anticipated would occur later in the year. And so I think we were thinking about a little bit more seasonality in the back half of the year. So I think, for instance, as I look at The Street estimates, I think The Street was projecting just steady improvement in volumes sort of throughout the year, which was sort of defied the traditional seasonality. And at the beginning of the year, that seemed to make some sense. But I think now that we've had such a strong second quarter, presuming that the COVID volumes decline relatively soon. I think we think the second half of the year will look a little more seasonal -- traditional seasonally than maybe we expected originally."

I think that a lot of the behavioral -- the strength in behavior and the increase in margins that you alluded to is being driven by strong pricing or revenue per adjusted day. And we talked about that quite a bit in the last few quarters. I think it's driven by lower level of denials, less uninsured patients, a number of other things, including some price -- negotiated price increases with some of our managed care payers, particularly our managed Medicaid payers. It's been a little bit difficult to sort of predict how sustainable those levels are. I think some of that improvement is based on a little bit less rigorous utilization management behavior on the part of payers. And I think there was a view that at some point, as we emerge from the pandemic, the payers would become sort of more aggressive than they have been during the pandemic. We'll see how that occurs. But I think we have a point of view that as pricing moderates some, our volumes will recover -- continue to recover. And that's really based on the labor sort of dynamics that you talked about. And again, I mentioned that we've been seeing from our own internal perspective, very impressive hiring numbers for the last few months. What is difficult to measure in real time is exactly how our turnover rates are doing for a while. I think they had stabilized, the concern is with the resurgence in COVID that turnover rates could increase because we've seen turnover rates increase every time that COVID volumes increase. So that's the piece that's a little bit difficult to peg with precision."

And all other things being equal, if you were able to achieve that, that EBITDA growth would meet or exceed that and margins would expand, et cetera. because this is still a largely fixed and semi-fixed cost business. Obviously, during the pandemic, that sort of traditional model was significantly disrupted because of an overemphasis on COVID patients who tend to be sicker, less profitable and a decline in non-COVID business, whose patients tend to be more profitable. But I think our point of view and again, we're not smart enough to know exactly what the cadence and frequency of the COVID patients is going to be. But I think our longer-term point of view was as the COVID volumes declined, and again, I think Q2 was a perfect example of this. We sort of returned to a more normalized model where volume growth was in the low single digits. Pricing growth was in the low single digits, on a combined basis, revenue growth was in the mid-single digits. EBITDA growing, margins were expanding, et cetera. And I think at this point, that's how we think about 2022 with the sort of caveat that we presume that 2022 will be a relatively quiet year from a COVID perspective, but that's probably more helpful than anything else at this point."

These are transactions in the $40 million, $50 million, $60 million range individual transactions, there really hasn't been real significant opportunities of size, although we continue to explore them and would pursue them if they made economic sense and more compelling from a financial return perspective. In the absence of those opportunities, and again, I think the second quarter was a good example of this. We just became a more aggressive acquirer of our own shares. We're buying back our shares even with sort of the strong recovery in our share price in Q2. We're buying back our shares, arguably somewhere in the 8.5x 9.5x EBITDA range. And honestly, we're hard pressed to find an opportunity to buy external EBITDA at those same multiples. So we view the opportunity to buy back our own shares as still pretty compelling.

What I will say, and I think I referenced this in an earlier comment is as I looked at the Street estimates for the year, it just seemed like they were a little heavy in the fourth quarter compared to what our expectations were. And I think that's because I'm really not being critical, the Street in creating their expectations for the year sort of ignored the normal seasonal patterns, said volumes would continue to recover because you had all this pent-up demand, et cetera. I think we have a point of view that because volumes have recovered earlier than our expectations, a lot of it sort of became front-end loaded. You see that in the Q2 results, not only for us but our peers that the fourth quarter will be -- have some of the more seasonal softness that we've seen historically because of the holidays, et cetera.

So sometimes it's difficult to identify what patients have an actual exchange product, et cetera. But what I do think, and I said this again in an earlier comment is despite all the economic disruption and particularly in the beginning of the pandemic, people losing their job, setting reduced hours, et cetera. We didn't see the accompanying increase in rates of uninsured the way that we have in previous sort of economic downturns. And I attribute some of that to the fact that obviously, the ACA was in place. And so for instance, in a state like Nevada, where we've seen a significant amount of weakness in the gaming industry, again, particularly early in the pandemic. We've seen an uptick in Medicaid utilization and I think that's generally been a good thing because I think these people would have been uninsured other than being able to fall back on expanded Medicaid benefit. So that sort of thing, I think, has been helpful. I think the presence of the ACA, Medicaid expansion in some of our important states like California, Nevada, greater ease in terms of being able to acquire commercial exchange products. I think all that's been helpful to keep that better payer mix that we seem to be experiencing, our peers seem to be experiencing during the pandemic."

Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.During the conference call, we will be using words such as b",662,"Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.
During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. 
As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.79 for the second quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.76 for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. 
In last night's press release, we identified 3 specific items, including supplemental Kentucky Medicaid reimbursements, an increase to our Self-Insured Professional and General Liability Reserves and the receipt of insurance proceeds. On a combined basis, these items had a net favorable impact on after-tax earnings of approximately $30 million during the second quarter of 2021. Even if one chooses to ignore the favorable impact entirely, our earnings during the quarter still exceeded our internal forecast by a wide margin.
For most of the second quarter, we experienced a continued decline in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals and a corresponding recovery in the number of non-COVID patients. As a result, most of our key volume metrics, including acute and behavioral patient days, emergency room visits and surgical cases, grew to levels approaching those that we were tracking before the pandemic began. This robust recovery in volumes exceeded the pace of our original forecast and drove the favorable operating results even in the face of continuing labor pressures in both of our business segments. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $119 million during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $1.45 billion during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the previously announced early repayment of $695 million of Medicare Accelerated Payments, which were received by us during 2020 and repaid to the government during the first quarter of 2021. We spent $482 million on capital expenditures during the first 6 months of 2021. At June 30, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 38.3% at June 30, 2020. 
As previously announced, we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 after suspending it in April 2020 as the COVID volume surged for the first time. During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.21 million shares at an aggregate cost of $350 million. And yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, leaving $1.2 billion remaining authorization. 
We were extremely pleased with our second quarter 2021 operating results, which we noted were well ahead of our internal forecast. As a consequence, we also raised our full year earnings guidance, including an approximately 6% to 8% increase in our full year forecasted adjusted EBITDA.
I would note that during the past 4 to 6 weeks, many of our hospitals have experienced significant surges in the number of COVID patients, and it is not evident that this surge has yet reached its peak. Given the uncertain impact of this most recent surge on non-COVID volumes and on labor shortages, we based our guidance for the second half of the year, primarily on our original internal forecast.
Marc and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

Well, Kevin, we've certainly discussed it for some time. I think we felt like before the pandemic began that the labor situation in our behavioral hospitals have largely stabilized from some of the challenges we've been having in the years before that. Obviously, the onset of the pandemic should have exacerbated and kind of created new challenges in terms of -- are finding sufficient numbers of therapists and nurses and mental health technicians who are nonprofessionals. For a variety of reasons, competition from telehealth providers, for therapists, nurses who were either burn out or contracting the virus or quarantining because they've been exposed to the virus or mental health technicians who we were competing with employers like Amazon or FedEx with. So a whole bunch of challenges, I think, during the pandemic. 
Again, I think as the pandemic eased in from its peaks early this year, I think the labor situation has been improving. And I think you saw that in Q2 with sequential improvement in our volumes and just a sort of a general stabilization of the behavioral business. Obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen an uptick in COVID patients in the last 4 to 6 weeks. I think it's a little too early to tell what sort of impact that's going to have on our ability to fill all of our open labor positions. And it's why, as I, again, commented in my prepared remarks, we've been a little bit cautious about our guidance in the back half of the year."

I will say that again, in May, June, July, we were setting internal records for how many people we were hiring at all levels as a result of some very focused activity on our part to increase our recruitment activities, et cetera. We were also focusing a great deal on increasing retention rates for those people we do hire, but again, express some level of caution and concern with the rise in COVID volumes in the last month or so only because every other time we've seen an increase in COVID patients, it does create an exacerbated pressure on those labor issues."

I mean, I think as we've commented many times over the course of the pandemic, the underlying demand by sort of every way that we measure it for behavioral care is as strong as it was pre-pandemic and, quite frankly, probably stronger, whether we measure that on inbound increased calls, internet inquiries, et cetera, or the amount of patients that were required to deflect because we don't have beds or we don't have sufficient staff, et cetera. Every indicator that we have both on a sort of macro industry-wide basis and a micro UHS basis indicates that the demand is still growing. 
As I indicated, I think we felt that as the pandemic eased, a lot of those pressures were easing, not necessarily disappearing by any stretch, but easing. We didn't have -- nurses weren't as burned out. Nurses weren't chasing those premium dollars. It just became easier to hire and to retain people. So I think that the COVID resurgence makes it a bit more challenging. But ultimately, we have a view that these shortages are temporary and transient in nature. And when they get resolved, which I think will happen as the pandemic eases over time, we'll be able to get back to pre-pandemic volumes and ultimately see pre-pandemic volumes."

So I think we commented in Q1, we reached our -- the peak of our COVID levels, the third wave of COVID patients was sort of in late December 2020 and into January of 2021. Those were our highest COVID levels at almost all of our hospitals that we experienced during the pandemic. 
I would say beginning in the second half of January and then pretty steadily from there, COVID volumes declined and non-COVID volumes have recovered and rebounded. And as I indicated again in my prepared remarks to the point that by the time we exited Q2, for most of our volume metrics, we were back to sort of pre-pandemic and we're sort of using 2019 as our measure of pre-pandemic levels of volumes. As I also indicated, we've seen COVID patients surge again beginning very late June and certainly well into July, and they don't appear to have peaked. 
Now what I will say is that our operators seem to be managing through this fourth wave of COVID very effectively. We certainly haven't seen a financial result since the COVID surge has resumed. But just from a volume metric perspective, we don't see that level of decline in things like elective surgeries or other activity that we've seen with other COVID surges. I think our operators are just much more accustomed to dealing with this, all of the sort of gating factors that have proved problematic in earlier surges, lack of PPE, lack of beds, lack of ventilators, those things, at least at the moment, don't exist. So we're coping much better. 
I do think probably the single-biggest issue we will have with the resumption of COVID is just exacerbated pressure on labor. Every time that COVID frequency has increased, there's been more and more pressure on labor, and that's tough to measure. I mean, I think we know that we're using more temporary labor in July, but what the ultimate impact of that will be will have to play out. But at least so far through July, we seem to be coping reasonably well. However, as I indicated again in my prepared remarks, because we're sort of uncertain as to how this plays out and what the cadence will be, we've been cautious and haven't assumed that our financial results will sort of exceed our internal forecast in the back half of the year the way they did in Q2. And we've just sort of presumed that we'll meet our original guidance for the back half of the year for the most part."

We're seeing in a lot of our markets fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients. We're seeing higher acuity of the patients we are treating. We've said, I think, from the beginning that the patients who's sort of been reluctant to come to the hospitals, driving softer emergency room activity, et cetera, tend to be lower acuity, Medicaid on insured patients. And so that mix obviously is reflected, albeit in lower volumes and higher revenue per unit, per adjusted admission, per adjusted patient day on both the acute and the behavioral side and increased earnings. 
So I think that's been generally a positive development, and so positive that, quite frankly, it has outweighed and even, I think, arguably overwhelmed the increased labor pressure that we've experienced. Now again, I'll caution that we may see a different dynamic in Q3 with higher levels of COVID patients, the mix may not be quite as favorable, but I think it was very favorable in Q2."

I think the fact of the matter is, and I think our second quarter results reflect this, that the decline in COVID patients was more rapid than we originally anticipated, and the recovery of non-COVID business was also correspondingly more rapid. And obviously, it led to second quarter results that were well ahead of our expectations. 
I think as we think about now the second half of the year, again, the most recent COVID surge sort of complicates that, and I don't know that were any of us are really insightful enough to know exactly how that will affect the ultimate trajectory for the rest of the year. But I think we have a point of view that some of the catch-up and recovery of those deferred procedures, et cetera, were realized in the second quarter that maybe we had anticipated would occur later in the year. And so I think we were thinking about a little bit more seasonality in the back half of the year. 
So I think, for instance, as I look at the Street estimates, I think the Street was projecting just steady improvement in volumes sort of throughout the year, which was sort of defied the traditional seasonality. And at the beginning of the year, that seemed to make some sense. But I think now that we've had such a strong second quarter, presuming that the COVID volumes decline relatively soon, I think we think the second half of the year will look a little more seasonal -- traditional seasonally than maybe we expected originally."

I think that a lot of the behavioral -- the strength in behavior and the increase in margins that you alluded to is being driven by strong pricing or revenue per adjusted day. And we talked about that quite a bit in the last few quarters. I think it's driven by lower level of denials, less uninsured patients, a number of other things, including some price -- negotiated price increases with some of our managed care payers, particularly our managed Medicaid payers. 
It's been a little bit difficult to sort of predict how sustainable those levels are. I think some of that improvement is based on a little bit less rigorous utilization management behavior on the part of payers. And I think there was a view that, at some point, as we emerge from the pandemic, the payers would become sort of more aggressive than they have been during the pandemic. We'll see how that occurs. 
But I think we have a point of view that as pricing moderates some, our volumes will recover -- continue to recover. And that's really based on the labor sort of dynamics that you talked about. And again, I mentioned that we've been seeing from our own internal perspective, very impressive hiring numbers for the last few months. What is difficult to measure in real time is exactly how our turnover rates are doing for a while. I think they have stabilized. The concern is with the resurgence in COVID that turnover rates could increase because we've seen turnover rates increase every time that COVID volumes increase. So that's the piece that's a little bit difficult to peg with, with precision."

And the way that we've always thought about the long-term model for both of these businesses is that they could and should grow from a top line perspective in the mid-single-digit range, 5%, 6%, 7%.  And all other things being equal, if you were able to achieve that, that EBITDA growth would meet or exceed that and margins would expand, et cetera, because this is still a largely fixed and semi-fixed cost business. 
Obviously, during the pandemic, that sort of traditional model was significantly disrupted because of an overemphasis on COVID patients who tend to be sicker, less profitable and a decline in non-COVID business, whose patients tend to be more profitable. But I think our point of view -- and again we're not smart enough to know exactly what the cadence and frequency of the COVID patients is going to be, but I think our longer-term point of view was, as the COVID volumes declined, and again, I think Q2 was a perfect example of this, we sort of returned to a more normalized model where volume growth was in the low single digits. Pricing growth was in the low single digits. On a combined basis, revenue growth was in the mid-single digits. EBITDA was growing. Margins were expanding, et cetera. And I think at this point, that's how we think about 2022 with the sort of caveat that we presume that 2022 will be a relatively quiet year from a COVID perspective, but that's probably more helpful than anything else at this point."

But I think we have -- we saw about interest level. I don't think our interest level in M&A has declined. I think somebody asked Marc the question specifically in the first quarter call, and he talked about the fact that we continue to look at and explore and perform diligence on a whole host of opportunities in both business segments at the end of the day other than some relatively small opportunities, which we pursue, things like micro hospitals and freestanding emergency departments, et cetera, that we've acquired. 
These are transactions in the $40 million, $50 million, $60 million range individual transactions. There really hasn't been real significant opportunities of size, although we continue to explore them and would pursue them if they made economic sense and more compelling from a financial return perspective. 
In the absence of those opportunities, and again I think the second quarter was a good example of this, we just became a more aggressive acquirer of our own shares. We're buying back our shares. Even with sort of the strong recovery in our share price in Q2, we're buying back our shares arguably, somewhere in the 8.5x, 9.5x EBITDA range. And honestly, we're hard pressed to find an opportunity to buy external EBITDA at those same multiples. So we view the opportunity to buy back our own shares as still pretty compelling. And I think we'll continue to do so. And we -- our original guidance for 2021 was that we would buy back $750 million worth of stock over the 3 quarters. We bought back $350 million in Q2.

I still believe that, obviously, some of the cadence and some of the trajectories this year are much harder to predict than ever before. 
What I will say, and I think I referenced this in an earlier comment is, as I looked at the Street estimates for the year, it just seemed like they were a little heavy in the fourth quarter compared to what our expectations were. And I think that's because I'm really not being critical, the Street in creating their expectations for the year sort of ignored the normal seasonal patterns, said volumes would continue to recover because you had all this pent-up demand, et cetera. I think we have a point of view that because volumes have recovered earlier than our expectations, a lot of it sort of became front-end loaded. You see that in the Q2 results, not only for us, but our peers that the fourth quarter will be -- have some of the more seasonal softness that we've seen historically because of the holidays, et cetera. So that's the only observation I'd make about the cadence and particularly the Street trajectory for the balance of the year."

I think what our actuary reported to us in the current period, and we, I think, affirmed with a number of other outside observers in this area is that the general trend in the country is for not necessarily more frequent malpractice cases, but more severe and more sort of dollar-intensive cases. And that's been our experience as well. So given that those results, they determined that we needed an increase in our reserves. We concurred. We recorded that.

Obviously, I don't know that all -- those sorts of negotiations were held in person or face-to-face historically. So I don't think that changed a great deal during the pandemic. I did note earlier and have noted, I think, in previous calls that we really made a concerted effort, particularly on the managed Medicaid side of the behavioral business to negotiate price increases that, in some cases, we haven't had for years. And I think that's helped to drive that really strong behavioral pricing that we've experienced throughout the pandemic. So that's the one change that I would highlight and suggest is certainly sustainable.
But other than that and other than, again, I think a comment that I've made before that our managed care payers, particularly on the behavioral side, seem to have been a little bit more lenient on utilization management and denials and length of stay during the pandemic.

We didn't see the accompanying increase in rates of uninsured the way that we have in previous sort of economic downturns. And I attribute some of that to the fact that, obviously, the ACA was in place. 
And so for instance, in a state like Nevada, where we've seen a significant amount of weakness in the gaming industry, again, particularly early in the pandemic. We've seen an uptick in Medicaid utilization, and I think that's generally been a good thing because I think these people would have been uninsured other than being able to fall back on expanded Medicaid benefit. So that sort of thing, I think, has been helpful. I think the presence of the ACA, Medicaid expansion in some of our important states like California, Nevada, greater ease in terms of being able to acquire commercial exchange products.

We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. 
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.60 for the third quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.67 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. 
For most of the third quarter, we experienced an escalation in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals. In our acute segment, this COVID surge resulted in measurably increased revenues due to the higher acuity and incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. Unlike previous surges, however, non-COVID volumes, including emergency room visits and elective and/or scheduled procedures were not crowded out. And in fact, generally, we're running at or near pre-pandemic levels. As a result, acute care revenues in the quarter were higher and managed to offset the premium labor costs and increased supply expense associated with the COVID patients, leading to an acute care EBITDA result in the quarter that was above our internal forecast. 
At the same time, the most recent surge created significant challenges for our behavioral segment. Volumes were pressured throughout the quarter due to the capping of bed capacity, in some cases, to properly isolate COVID patients, and in other cases because of a shortage of appropriate patient care personnel. Generally, behavioral patient days during the quarter ran 4% to 6% below comparable pre-pandemic levels. The effect of the reduced volumes combined with higher labor costs led to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter, measurably below our internal forecast. 
Our cash generated from operating activities was $442 million during the third quarter of 2021 as compared to $767 million during the same period in 2020. Included in our cash generated from operating activities during last year's third quarter was approximately $400 million of additional funds received in connection with various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act. We spent $667 million on capital expenditures during the first 9 months of 2021. 
At September 30, '21, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.4% as compared to 37.7% at September 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021, we opened 157 new beds in our Las Vegas market, including 69 new beds at Henderson Hospital. We acquired 88 new beds through the acquisition of the Las Vegas Specialty Hospital, which will serve orthopedic and surgical patients. And we acquired Elite Medical Center [indiscernible] hospital, offering emergency and inpatient care adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. 
In addition, we continue to grow our freestanding emergency department footprint with 19 sites expected to be operational by the end of the year in 2021 and an additional 5 approved and under construction, which are expected to open in 2022. Construction also continues on Northern Nevada sierra Hospital, a 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in March of 2022. 
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2021, we continue to be an active acquirer of our own shares based in large part on our view that the underlying patient demand for our services and particularly in our behavioral segment remains fundamentally strong, and that our ability to more fully -- to meet that demand will incrementally improve as COVID volumes continue to decline. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.78 million shares at an aggregate cost of $419 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares.

But some of them, I suspect, will be clarified by other people as well. So as far as the labor shortage in the behavioral segment goes, to the degree that it is caused by the COVID surge itself, as you know, that's largely out of our control. On the other hand, we are extremely focused and have a great number of initiatives to increase the efficiency of both our recruitment and retention functions. 
We're actually hiring employees, nurses as well as other personnel at record levels over the last several months. The challenge is that the churn or the turnover or the number of employees leaving at the same time for us as well as I believe most other hospitals is also quite large, and I think driven in large part by the COVID surge as well because many nurses, in particular, have the opportunity to work in a more acute setting, in an ICU and ER, et cetera, and earn 400% or 500% of their salary if they're willing to travel or to work in a COVID environment. 
So that challenge, I think, is difficult for us to overcome, although we're certainly trying. But I think that it will naturally abate as COVID volumes decline and those opportunities for nurses to earn those premiums or to dollars will decline. And I think most nurses will ultimately return to their home, both literally and figuratively, geographically as well as back to their original jobs. And many of our nurses have told us that. So we continue to be extremely focused on those activities. To the degree, I think that you had other questions, I'll wait and allow others to follow up."

So we have a number of geographies in the state of California, the state of Oregon, the city of Philadelphia and there are others that have vaccine mandates. I think for the most part, we have found that those vaccine mandates have not had a material impact on the labor situation, in part because the mandates are pervasive. So it's not like if an employee wants to continue working and doesn't want to get vaccinated, they can work in somebody else's facility rather than ours. 
We have not on our own mandated the vaccine in any of our facilities where it is not mandated by a government authority, in part because given the shortage of labor personnel, we're not anxious to give people a reason to go elsewhere, although we certainly are encouraging our employees as strongly as we can to become vaccinated. So I don't think it's been a real significant factor. 
As far as staffing in the acute side, I mean, I think we're feeling these labor pressures that I alluded to certainly in both business segments. But I think what we have found, and I think this has been true throughout the pandemic, is that on the acute side, the labor shortage tends to manifest itself in higher premium hours and premium pay. So in other words, we're able to fill most of our vacant, mostly nursing hours, but we fill it with premium pay that could either be over time from our own employees, shift differential, temporary nurses, traveling nurses, et cetera. It's a very expensive alternative. But for the most part, we're able to fill most of our hours. 
And the good news on the acute side is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the higher acuity, the higher revenue, the higher volumes has been effectively offsetting those higher labor costs. The challenge on the behavioral side is that we are unable to fill a lot of those vacant hours, even with premium dollars. We're certainly spending some premium dollars. But in some cases, we're just unable to fill the hours. And as a consequence, we're having to turn patients away. And therefore, we've got lower volumes. Again, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, 4% to 6% below pre-pandemic levels, and not enough revenue to offset the higher labor costs. So different manifestation of, I think, the same sorts of broad dynamics in the labor shortage in the 2 business segments."

I mean there's not -- I actually have tried to sort of see if there's an absolute formula, and I don't know that there is, but I think there is a very close correlation. And so we're -- we've got behavioral facilities in 37 states all around the country, et cetera. It would be difficult for me to, sort of, tick off literally geography by geography where we've seen kind of above average levels of COVID, et cetera. 
But where we see above-average levels of COVID, we tend to see the labor pressures and therefore, softer volumes. And in those markets where we don't, we tend to see demand being manifested strongly. We're able to satisfy that demand, et cetera, which is why we remain pretty bullish about the idea that as COVID volumes overall recede as they have started to do, I think, in the last 4, 5, 6 weeks, we'll start to see some easing of those labor pressures. Maybe not immediately because I do think there is a time lag associated with a lot of these commitments of traveling and temporary nurses. 
And I think we saw that in Q1, where even as COVID volumes declined as early as mid-January 2021, it took a while for us to really sort of enjoy the benefits of that. So we still struggled some in Q1, but then Q2 with lower COVID volumes saw upticks in volumes and not nearly as much pressure on the labor side. And I think we're hoping that's sort of the same trend we're likely to see now."

But our sense, and both objectively to the degree that objective data is available and subjectively to the degree that we're able to talk with our competitors, and the nature of the hospital industry is that employees, particularly nurses and patient care employees tend to move in many cases from one facility to another. 
So it's relatively easy to keep track of what's happening in the market. And I think what we find is that in markets where we're struggling for labor, it seems like all of our peers are struggling in the same way and vice versa. So while we're very focused on the things that we can do to improve and be more efficient from a recruitment and retention perspective, we acknowledge that these labor pressures are sort of more broad and more comprehensive than we have control over. 
But certainly, from a wage competitiveness issue, et cetera, we're always following what the market conditions are and literally changing and adjusting if not on a daily basis, on a weekly basis so that we're being as competitive as we can possibly be."

And frankly, if in fact, COVID continues to decline, we suspect that it will, it has been certainly at the moment. So how quickly the COVID volumes recede and therefore, how quickly the labor pressures ease. 
And again, with the notion that I think there is some delay of at least a couple of months, et cetera. So my sense is because we're probably -- it will be difficult to sort of have a full recovery in Q4 from the labor pressures, it would be difficult to sort of have an outperformance in both of our business segments in Q4. As a consequence, I think getting to the high end of our range would certainly be a little more challenging. But -- and I think the fact that we're reaffirming guidance is indicative of the fact that we feel like getting into the lower to mid-range of our guidance should be achievable as long as we continue to see the COVID trends and the labor trends that we've started to see at the very end of September and into October. 
As far as 2022 goes, even in what I would describe in [indiscernible] is a normal year, we wouldn't be giving guidance for the following year as part of our third quarter call. And so in an environment that is as uncertain as today is, we're certainly not going to do that either. But I will say this, I mean I think as we think about creating our 2022 guidance and think about what the business looks like next year, we tend to use 2019 as a base, 2019 being a pandemic-free year. And even though we don't expect 2022 to be COVID free, we just think that 2019 is kind of a more meaningful base. 
And I think we -- as we would in any normal year, we would expect to grow off that base. And the question sort of becomes, do we expect to experience sort of cumulative 2 or 3 years growth off of that base? Or do we expect to get just 1 year's worth of growth? And I think that's ultimately, where we're going to spend a lot of our focus when we do sit down and do our 2022 forecasting with more precision. 
And my gut is somewhere in between. We'll expect 2022 to grow more than just a year's worth over that 2019 base, but certainly not the full sort of 3 years' worth of I think that there has been some development activity and growth activity that we've just lost during the pandemic and won't be sort of recapture-able. So I've seen some consensus numbers, which I don't look at in great detail that show us in the sort of the high single digits, 7%, 8%, 9% above 2019. And levels and at the moment can certainly change, but that doesn't feel unreasonable."

I mean, so -- again, I would make the point that I think the underlying wage inflation is not what is mostly driving the wage pressure. It is the premium pay. It's -- the use of over time it's the payment of temporary nurses and traveling nurses and sign-on bonuses and that sort of thing. 
And to your point about the outlook, is this temporary or structural, I think the honest answer is something in between. I do think there's no question that a lot of this demand, heightened demand has been created by the COVID surge itself. Again, if you can go online, and look for nursing opportunities, not that any of this call is necessarily going to do that. But if you did, you'd see that those opportunities are working in COVID units, in ICUs and ERs, et cetera. 
And I think as the virus recedes and just become sort of settled in at what they described as endemic -- rather pandemic levels, we just think a lot of those opportunities will naturally sort of fall away. And nurses, again, will sort of retreat back to their original jobs, if you will. So that part, I think, is certainly temporary. 
I do think there is some structural changes that have been made. I think there are some nurses that have permanently left the workforce, either to take new jobs, and they've been retrained in different specialties, or they've just been burned out, et cetera. And I think it's incumbent upon us. And quite likely the hospitals in general will come up with, as a result, new patient care models that rely less on RNs in particular and other caregivers, LPNs and tech and EMTs, et cetera, as well as more -- relies more on technology that allows us to deliver the same level of patient care without necessarily the same number, particularly registered nurses. 
So part of I think this issue is structural, and we'll address that. And part of it is temporary that I think will naturally get better as the virus numbers recede."

And in this pandemic, 4 months feels like a lifetime in the sense of how things can change, et cetera. But I think -- how we think about the 2 business segments, how we think about overall growth is, again, going to very much depend on whether the cadence of virus frequency continues to recede as it has been doing over the last month or so, whether there are any new variants or upticks in the wintertime, et cetera, which some people expect there might be and then how the labor shortage is really affected.

So again, those numbers vary by business segment pretty dramatically. I would say on the acute side, the percentage of premium hours in this surge was probably in the high single digits, 8%, 9%, getting close to 10%. Not quite as high as it was back in the January '21 period because I think the COVID numbers themselves were not as high, but still pretty high. 
On the behavioral side, I think our premium hours are only around about 2% of our overall hours and harkening back to comments I've already made, it's because we can't get enough of those premium hours to satisfy the need that we have. We wish we could, quite frankly. And that's why it's been more of a challenge on the behavioral side because filling those hours is more difficult. 
Keep in mind that employees in the behavioral setting, particularly nurses, are generally making less than they would otherwise make in an acute setting. I think that has always been true. And when there's been a small differential, I think there's always been sufficient reasons why many nurses prefer to work in a behavioral setting. It's very different, and every nurse has sort of a different view of what they're looking for in a patient care experience. 
when a nurse has the opportunity to make 400% or 500% of her base salary, all of a sudden, I think a lot of those other factors become less important, and the financial dynamics just overwhelm everything else. And I think that's what we're seeing in this current surge. And I think the other thing that's worth noting is the current surge related to the Delta variant is the first surge we've seen during the pandemic in which many of the nurses are vaccinated. And so pursuing these very lucrative financial opportunities, I think nurse's view is a less risky proposition than they might have a year ago or 18 months ago before they were vaccinated."

September, we saw some surgical and elective deflections and postponements. It feels like -- and I don't have all the data, but it feels like we've already recaptured a lot of that in October. So it doesn't feel like there's a real, sort of, permanent loss there. And again, in the sense, as I've now said a few times, is COVID volumes have clearly been declining for the last 4, 5, 6 weeks.  We're seeing some early indications of that leading to some also easing of the labor pressures, although again, I'll repeat what I've also said again a number of times. I think there is a time lag there. 
And because a lot of these commitments -- both that we make to nurses, traveling nurses and temporary nurses and that nurses make to other facilities have a sort of time lapse associated with them. We don't feel the impact of those declining COVID volumes on the labor pressures immediately. But we've certainly seen the first early signs of it, and I think they'll certainly continue during the quarter if the COVID volumes continue to decline."

I mean the interesting thing, I think, is that payer mix has remained relatively stable during the pandemic. Obviously, there's some government assistance there. So there's [indiscernible] program, pays hospitals for uncompensated patients or patients who have COVID that are uninsured and that's been helpful to keep down uncompensated volumes and bad debt expense. 
We've seen, I think, as most hospitals have reported, a shift in COVID patients in this most recent surge to a bit of a younger cohort, because I think such a large proportion of the Medicare age population has been vaccinated and because so many of the COVID patients now are unvaccinated, they tend to be younger and more patients in their 40s and 50s. They tend to be a little bit more commercial than Medicare. 
But again, honestly, I don't think the payer mix and -- I mean the stability of the payer mix has been helpful. But the slight improvement in the payer mix is, in my mind, not what's driving the strong acute care results. It's the combination of the acuity, the reimbursement, et cetera, associated with the COVID patients, combined with the relative strength and recovery in the non-COVID volumes, I think has much more of an impact than actually a slightly improved payer mix."

So I don't think you're seeing a real robust deal flow of not-for-profit hospitals looking for an exit strategy or partner, et cetera. 
But there are deals that we're always looking at. I mean, I highlighted in, again, my opening comments, we've done a couple of smaller deals like buying a micro hospital and specialty hospital in Las Vegas, continuing to invest in our freestanding emergency room development. And I would add that those freestanding emergency rooms have really performed very well. 
I think they've performed very well from the outset, but I think have done particularly well during the pandemic. There seems to be the willingness of patients to potentially get their care at a freestanding ED and feel somewhat safe or less threatened than they do in a large hospital emergency room. So all of that's good stuff. 
I think on joint venture initiative side of behavioral, we didn't talk about it this quarter, but I think we mentioned last quarter that we've opened a joint venture hospitals with acute care partners in Iowa, in Missouri this year. We're scheduled to open in the next few months in Michigan, in Wisconsin, our first behavioral hospital in Wisconsin. So that deal flow of these joint venture opportunities continues, and I think, we think, is a source of significant growth for us. 
So we'll continue to pursue those. And then there are other deals out there in behavioral. I think we view it as an indication of the fundamental strength of the behavioral business that these deals attract a lot of interest, both from strategic players as well as financial sponsors. So there can be pretty frothy auction processes. But we look at a lot of those as well, and we'll continue to do that."

And so that dynamic, and I mentioned it before that even though we mostly ran at pre-pandemic levels, we did have some deferrals and postponement in particularly in the September time frame and particularly on the inpatient side. I think our point of view is that as COVID volumes decline, the demand for non-COVID activities will be able to backfill the sort of the loss of COVID with those non-COVID activities as long as the labor situation allows us to do that. 
I think, again, in both of our business segments, I think we're more focused on our ability to meet the demand than whether the demand is really going to be there. We have every indication that demand for both business segments remain quite strong."

Well, first, I'd make a point that to a degree, although we sort of talk about these factors as being discrete and separate, they often sort of interplay on each other. So when we have a COVID surge in a facility, we're likely to have more COVID patients. We're likely to have more of our employees who are either out with the virus or out because they've been exposed to the virus. 
And so -- and whenever there's a COVID surge, we're going to face incremental challenges. And sometimes, we'll say that we've capped the beds because we've got COVID patients sometimes we say it's because we can't find enough bed. Often, it's both in a combined way. 
But again, as I think we've said multiple times, I think what we find and have found every time in the second quarter, I think it was reflective of this, that as the COVID volumes decline, both of those pressures tend to ease. But if I have to say one was more prevalent than the other, I'd say that the labor shortage has been a more pervasive, impactful issue than the actual, sort of, isolation of the patient's issue."

In some cases, a majority equity ownership as in Las Vegas. In other cases, some equity ownership. But we view sort of an ACO strategy, sometimes the presence of a Medicare Advantage insurance product as integral to those markets. 
And I think they've been very helpful. And again, we don't really talk about our insurance company sort of as a separate entity because at the end of the day, it largely exists as sort of an adjacency or a corollary to the strength of our kind of fully integrated delivery network in a market and we tend to talk about the markets themselves rather than the individual components.

I mean, again, I'm going to make the point that I've made before. I mean I think that the COVID crisis has created an opportunity for nurses, both acute and behavioral nurses, to earn wage rates that are just beyond anything that has been previously comparable. Again, it sounds like you've done a lot of research, you know you're going to have to do a ton. 
But if you go online and look for nursing opportunities, you can see that there are nursing opportunities in which nurses can easily earn $10,000 a week working in a COVID environment. So these are nurses who maybe are earning $70,000 or $80,000 a year, maybe $80,000 or $90,000 a year. But now they're earning at a rate of $500,000 a year. So when you have those sort of opportunities, there's no way we can close that gap. That gap will be closed by the elimination of those opportunities. 
So that, I think, is the issue. And again, I think the comment that we were making before, I was making before, is while we've hired a record number of -- and not just nurses, by the way, this includes therapists and mental health tech, et cetera, we're seeing quite a bit of churn. And again, as you know, I mean, I think the American labor force in general is seeing quite a bit of churn. 
Obviously, I think it's more exacerbated in health care in hospitals. But it is a bit of a dynamic that we're seeing across the labor landscape. So we continue, in every market, we've always spent time making sure that our wages are competitive and performing compensation studies, et cetera. We're more attuned to that now and are doing it more frequently than we've ever had before. And we certainly acknowledge that, particularly, we've got to be competitive with our peers, with other behavioral hospitals, et cetera. 
But behavioral nurse is always going to be able to make more money in an ICU setting in an ER setting than in a behavioral setting. Again, I've talked to many, many nurses, both acute and behavioral, over the years. And I think for the most part, they work where they work because they enjoy the patient care dynamics in the setting in which they work. And again, when there's a 10% or 20% pay differential, I think nurses can convince themselves that they want to work where they're happier. When there's a 4% or 500% differential, that becomes a tougher argument to make."

Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021.
During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.  
We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.60 for the third quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.67 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.  
For most of the third quarter, we experienced an escalation in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals. In our acute segment, this COVID surge resulted in measurably increased revenues due to the higher acuity and incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. Unlike previous surges, however, non-COVID volumes, including emergency room visits and elective and/or scheduled procedures, were not crowded out. And in fact, generally, we're running at or near pre-pandemic levels. As a result, acute care revenues in the quarter were higher and managed to offset the premium labor costs and increased supply expense associated with the COVID patients, leading to an acute care EBITDA result in the quarter that was above our internal forecast.  
At the same time, the most recent surge created significant challenges for our behavioral segment. Volumes were pressured throughout the quarter due to the capping of bed capacity, in some cases, to properly isolate COVID patients and, in other cases, because of a shortage of appropriate patient care personnel. Generally, behavioral patient days during the quarter ran 4% to 6% below comparable pre-pandemic levels. The effect of the reduced volumes combined with higher labor costs led to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter measurably below our internal forecast.  
Our cash generated from operating activities was $442 million during the third quarter of 2021 as compared to $767 million during the same period in 2020. Included in our cash generated from operating activities during last year's third quarter was approximately $400 million of additional funds received in connection with various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act. We spent $667 million on capital expenditures during the first 9 months of 2021. At September 30, '21, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.4% as compared to 37.7% at September 30, 2020.
During the third quarter of 2021, we opened 157 new beds in our Las Vegas market, including 69 new beds at Henderson Hospital. We acquired 88 new beds through the acquisition of the Las Vegas Specialty Hospital, which will serve orthopedic and surgical patients. And we acquired Elite Medical Center micro-hospital offering emergency and inpatient care adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip.  
In addition, we continue to grow our freestanding emergency department footprint with 19 sites expected to be operational by the end of the year in 2021 and an additional 5 approved and under construction which are expected to open in 2022. Construction also continues on Northern Nevada Sierra Hospital, a 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in March of 2022.  
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2021, we continue to be an active acquirer of our own shares based in large part on our view that the underlying patient demand for our services and particularly in our behavioral segment remains fundamentally strong and that our ability to more fully -- to meet that demand will incrementally improve as COVID volumes continue to decline.
During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.78 million shares at an aggregate cost of $419 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares.  
We'll be pleased to answer your questions at this time."

But some of them, I suspect, will be clarified by other people as well. So as far as the labor shortage in the behavioral segment goes, to the degree that it is caused by the COVID surge itself, as you know, that's largely out of our control. On the other hand, we are extremely focused and have a great number of initiatives to increase the efficiency of both our recruitment and retention functions.
We're actually hiring employees, nurses as well as other personnel at record levels over the last several months. The challenge is that the churn or the turnover or the number of employees leaving at the same time for us as well as, I believe, most other hospitals is also quite large and I think driven in large part by the COVID surge as well because many nurses, in particular, have the opportunity to work in a more acute setting, in an ICU, in an ER, et cetera, and earn 400% or 500% of their salary if they're willing to travel or to work in a COVID environment.  
And so that challenge, I think, is difficult for us to overcome, although we're certainly trying. But I think that it will naturally abate as COVID volumes decline and those opportunities for nurses to earn those premium sorts of dollars will decline. And then I think most nurses will ultimately return to their home, both literally and figuratively, geographically as well as back to their original jobs. And many of our nurses have told us that. So we continue to be extremely focused on those activities.
To the degree, I think, that you had other questions, I'll wait and allow others to follow up."

So we have a number of geographies in the state of California, the state of Oregon, the city of Philadelphia and there are others that have vaccine mandates. I think for the most part, we have found that those vaccine mandates have not had a material impact on the labor situation, in part because the mandates are pervasive. So it's not like if an employee wants to continue working and doesn't want to get vaccinated, they can work in somebody else's facility rather than ours.  
We have not on our own mandated the vaccine in any of our facilities where it is not mandated by a government authority, in part because given the shortage of labor personnel, we're not anxious to give people a reason to go elsewhere, although we certainly are encouraging our employees as strongly as we can to become vaccinated. So I don't think it's been a real significant factor.  
As far as staffing in the acute side, I mean I think we're feeling these labor pressures that I alluded to certainly in both business segments. But I think what we have found, and I think this has been true throughout the pandemic, is that on the acute side, the labor shortage tends to manifest itself in higher premium hours and premium pay.
So in other words, we're able to fill most of our vacant, mostly nursing hours, but we fill it with premium pay that could either be overtime from our own employees, shift differential, temporary nurses, traveling nurses, et cetera. It's a very expensive alternative. But for the most part, we're able to fill most of our hours. And the good news on the acute side is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the higher acuity, the higher revenue, the higher volumes has been effectively offsetting those higher labor costs.
The challenge on the behavioral side is that we are unable to fill a lot of those vacant hours even with premium dollars. We're certainly spending some premium dollars. But in some cases, we're just unable to fill the hours. And as a consequence, we're having to turn patients away. And therefore, we've got lower volumes, again, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, 4% to 6% below pre-pandemic levels and not enough revenue to offset the higher labor cost. So different manifestation of, I think, the same sorts of broad dynamics in the labor shortage in the 2 business segments."

I mean I think what we have found, Andrew, is that the pressure on labor, in particular, but therefore, the pressure on volumes, is very much tied to the level of COVID. I mean there's not -- I actually have tried to sort of see if there's an absolute formula, and I don't know that there is, but I think there is a very close correlation. And so we're -- we've got behavioral facilities in 37 states all around the country, et cetera. It would be difficult for me to sort of tick off literally geography by geography where we've seen kind of above-average levels of COVID, et cetera.  
But where we see above-average levels of COVID, we tend to see the labor pressures and, therefore, softer volumes. And in those markets where we don't, we tend to see demand being manifested strongly. We're able to satisfy that demand, et cetera, which is why we remain pretty bullish about the idea that as COVID volumes overall recede as they have started to do, I think, in the last 4, 5, 6 weeks, we'll start to see some easing of those labor pressures. Maybe not immediately because I do think there is a time lag associated with a lot of these commitments of traveling and temporary nurses.  
And I think we saw that in Q1 where even as COVID volumes declined as early as mid-January 2021, it took a while for us to really sort of enjoy the benefits of that. So we still struggled some in Q1. But then Q2, with lower COVID volumes, saw upticks in volumes and not nearly as much pressure on the labor side. And I think we're hoping that's sort of the same trend we're likely to see now."

So market share data on the behavioral side is not, I think, as robust or precise as it is on the acute side. But our sense, and both objectively to the degree that objective data is available and subjectively to the degree that we're able to talk with our competitors, and the nature of the hospital industry is that employees, particularly nurses and patient care employees, tend to move in many cases from one facility to another. So it's relatively easy to keep track of what's happening in the market.
And I think what we find is that in markets where we're struggling for labor, it seems like all of our peers are struggling in the same way and vice versa. So while we're very focused on the things that we can do to improve and be more efficient from a recruitment and retention perspective, we acknowledge that these labor pressures are sort of more broad and more comprehensive than we have control over. But certainly, from a wage competitiveness issue, et cetera, we're always following what the market conditions are and literally changing and adjusting, if not on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, so that we're being as competitive as we can possibly be."

And frankly, if in fact COVID continues to decline, we suspect that it will, it has that feel certainly at the moment, so how quickly the COVID volumes recede and, therefore, how quickly the labor pressures ease, and again, with the notion that I think there is some delay of at least a couple of months, et cetera.
So my sense is because we're probably -- it will be difficult to sort of have a full recovery in Q4 from the labor pressures, it would be difficult to sort of have an outperformance in both of our business segments in Q4. As a consequence, I think getting to the high end of our range would certainly be a little more challenging. But -- and I think the fact that we're reaffirming guidance is indicative of the fact that we feel like getting into the lower to mid-range of our guidance should be achievable as long as we continue to see the COVID trends and the labor trends that we've started to see at the very end of September and into October.  
As far as 2022 goes, even in what I would describe as a ""normal year,"" we wouldn't be giving guidance for the following year as part of our third quarter call. And so in an environment that is as uncertain as today is, we're certainly not going to do that either. But I will say this, I mean I think as we think about creating our 2022 guidance and think about what the business looks like next year, we tend to use 2019 as a base, 2019 being a pandemic-free year. And even though we don't expect 2022 to be COVID free, we just think that 2019 is kind of a more meaningful base. And I think we -- as we would in any normal year, we would expect to grow off that base.
And the question sort of becomes, do we expect to experience sort of cumulative 2 or 3 years' growth off of that base? Or do we expect to get just 1 year's worth of growth? And I think that's ultimately where we're going to spend a lot of our focus when we do sit down and do our 2022 forecasting with more precision. And my gut is it's somewhere in between.
We'll expect 2022 to grow more than just a year's worth over that 2019 base, but certainly not the full sort of 3 years' worth, I think, that there has been some development activity and growth activity that we've just lost during the pandemic and won't be sort of recapturable. So I've seen some consensus numbers, which I don't look at in great detail, that show us in the sort of the high single digits, 7%, 8%, 9% above 2019 levels. And at the moment, and this could certainly change, but that doesn't feel unreasonable."

And to your point about, look, is this temporary or structural, I think the honest answer is something in between. I do think there's no question that a lot of this demand -- heightened demand has been created by the COVID surge itself. Again, if you can go online and look for nursing opportunities, not that anybody on this call is necessarily going to do that, but if you did, you'd see that those opportunities are working in COVID units, in ICUs and ERs, et cetera.  
And I think as the virus recedes and just become sort of settles in at what they described as endemic rather pandemic levels, we just think a lot of those opportunities will naturally sort of fall away. And nurses, again, will sort of retreat back to their original jobs, if you will. So that part, I think, is certainly temporary. I do think there is some structural changes that have been made. I think there are some nurses that have permanently left the workforce, either to take new jobs and they've been retrained in different specialties or they've just been burned out, et cetera.
And I think it's incumbent upon us. And quite frankly, I think hospitals in general will come up with, as a result, new patient care models that rely less on RNs in particular and other caregivers, LPNs and techs and EMTs, et cetera, as well as more -- relies more on technology that allows us to deliver the same level of patient care without necessarily the same number, particularly registered nurses. So part of, I think, this issue is structural, and we'll address that. And part of it is temporary that I think will naturally get better as the virus numbers recede."

And in this pandemic, 4 months feels like a lifetime in the sense of how things can change, et cetera.
But I think how we think about the 2 business segments, how we think about overall growth is, again, going to very much depend on whether the cadence of virus frequency continues to recede as it has been doing over the last month or so, whether there are any new variants or upticks in the wintertime, et cetera, which some people expect there might be and then how the labor shortage is really affected. 
And sort of getting back to the previous question, we'll have a better feel for how much of this labor pressure is really temporary and gets better and how much we have to sort of address in a more structural way. So again, other than the comments that I've already made, as I said, we wouldn't be giving precise guidance in a normal, predictable year, and this is far from that.

So again, those numbers vary by business segment pretty dramatically. I would say on the acute side, the percentage of premium hours in this surge was probably in the high single digits, 8%, 9%, getting close to 10%. Not quite as high as it was back",328,"Yes. So again, those numbers vary by business segment pretty dramatically. I would say on the acute side, the percentage of premium hours in this surge was probably in the high single digits, 8%, 9%, getting close to 10%. Not quite as high as it was back in the January '21 period because I think the COVID numbers themselves were not as high, but still pretty high. 
On the behavioral side, I think our premium hours only run about 2% of our overall hours. And harkening back to comments I've already made, it's because we can't get enough of those premium hours to satisfy the need that we have. We wish we could, quite frankly. And that's why it's been more of a challenge on the behavioral side because filling those hours is more difficult. 
Keep in mind that employees in the behavioral setting, particularly nurses, are generally making less than they would otherwise make in an acute setting. I think that has always been true. And when there's been a small differential, I think there's always been sufficient reasons why many nurses prefer to work in a behavioral setting. It's very different, and every nurse has sort of a different view of what they're looking for in a patient care experience. 
When a nurse has the opportunity to make 400% or 500% of her base salary, all of a sudden, I think a lot of those other factors become less important, and the financial dynamics just overwhelm everything else. And I think that's what we're seeing in this current surge. And I think the other thing that's worth noting is the current surge related to the delta variant is the first surge we've seen during the pandemic in which many of the nurses are vaccinated. And so pursuing these very lucrative financial opportunities, I think nurse's view is a less risky proposition than they might have a year ago or 18 months ago before they were vaccinated."

That's my first question. 
And then the second one is just with regard to all these issues, since the end of the quarter, have you seen any incremental changes in anything like -- or COVID, are you seeing COVID volumes going down? Are you starting to see the use of temporary labor start to change? And are you seeing any kind of changes in the overall mix of your patients from a payer standpoint?"

So the percentage of our acute care admissions that had a COVID diagnosis during the third quarter was around 14%.

So the percentage of our acute care admissions that had a COVID diagnosis during the third quarter was around 14%. Keep in mind that because the length of stay is probably, on average, about twice for a COVID patient than a non-COVID patient, that's something close to 30% of our patient days were represented by patients with a COVID diagnosis. So pretty significant impact. 
But as I indicated in my earlier remarks, we did have that same crowding-out dynamic for most of the quarter. For most of the quarter, ER traffic, elective and scheduled procedures were -- really have recovered and rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, maybe a little above, maybe a little below. 
September, we saw some surgical and elective deflections and postponements. It feels like, and I don't have all the data, but it feels like we've already recaptured a lot of that in October. So it doesn't feel like there's a real sort of permanent loss there. And again, in the sense, as I've now said a few times, is COVID volumes have clearly been declining for the last 4, 5, 6 weeks. We're seeing some early indications of that leading to some also easing of the labor pressures, although again, I'll repeat what I've also said again a number of times, I think there is a time lag there. 
And because a lot of these commitments, both that we make to nurses, traveling nurses and temporary nurses and that nurses make to other facilities, have a sort of time lapse associated with them, we don't feel the impact of those declining COVID volumes on the labor pressures immediately. But we've certainly seen the first early signs of it, and I think they'll certainly continue during the quarter if the COVID volumes continue to decline."

I mean the interesting thing, I think, is that payer mix has remained relatively stable during the pandemic. Obviously, there's some government assistance there. So first, the program pays hospitals for uncompensated patients or patients who have COVID but are uninsured, and that's been helpful to  keep down uncompensated volumes and bad debt expense. 
We've seen, I think, as most hospitals have reported, a shift in COVID patients in this most recent surge to a bit of a younger cohort because I think such a large proportion of the Medicare age population has been vaccinated. And because so many of the COVID patients now are unvaccinated, they tend to be younger and more patients in their 40s and 50s. They tend to be a little bit more commercial than Medicare. 
But again, honestly, I don't think the payer mix and -- I mean the stability of the payer mix has been helpful. But the slight improvement in the payer mix is, in my mind, not what's driving the strong acute care results. It's the combination of the acuity, the reimbursement, et cetera, associated with the COVID patients, combined with the relative strength and recovery in the non-COVID volumes, I think has much more of an impact than actually a slightly improved payer mix."

And so on the acute side, I actually think in retrospect that the significant amount of infusion of government subsidies, reimbursement, mainly in the form of the CARES Act funds, has helped support not-for-profit hospitals that might have otherwise felt more financial to rest during the pandemic. So I don't think you're seeing a real robust deal flow of not-for-profit hospitals looking for an exit strategy or partner, et cetera. 
But there are deals that we're always looking at. I mean I highlighted in, again, my opening comments, we've done a couple of smaller deals, buying a micro-hospital and a specialty hospital in Las Vegas, continuing to invest in our freestanding emergency room development. And I would add that those freestanding emergency rooms have really performed very well. I think they've performed very well from the outset, but I think have done particularly well during the pandemic. There seems to be the willingness of patients to potentially get their care at a freestanding ED and feel somewhat safe or less threatened than they do in a large hospital emergency room. So all of that is good stuff. 
I think on joint venture initiative side of behavioral, we didn't talk about it this quarter, but I think we mentioned last quarter that we've opened joint venture hospitals with acute care partners in Iowa, in Missouri this year. We're scheduled to open in the next few months in Michigan, in Wisconsin, our first behavioral hospital in Wisconsin. So that deal flow of these joint venture opportunities continues and I think -- we think is a source of significant growth for us. So we'll continue to pursue those.
And then there are other deals out there in behavioral. I think we view it as an indication of the fundamental strength of the behavioral business that these deals attract a lot of interest, both from strategic players as well as financial sponsors. So there can be pretty frothy auction processes. But we look at a lot of those as well, and we'll continue to do that."

And so that dynamic, and I mentioned it before that even though we mostly ran at pre-pandemic levels, we did have some deferrals and postponement in particularly in the September time frame and particularly on the inpatient side.
I think our point of view is that as COVID volumes decline, the demand for non-COVID activities will be able to backfill the sort of the loss of COVID with those non-COVID activities as long as the labor situation allows us to do that. I think, again, in both of our business segments, I think we're more focused on our ability to meet the demand than whether the demand is really going to be there.

We're likely to have more of our employees who are either out with the virus or out because they've been exposed to the virus. And so -- and whenever there's a COVID surge, we're going to face incremental challenges. And sometimes, we'll say that we've capped the beds because we've got COVID patients. And sometimes we say it's because we can't find enough staff. Often, it's both in a combined way. 
But again, as I think we've said multiple times, I think what we find and have found every time, and the second quarter, I think, was reflective of this, that as the COVID volumes decline, both of those pressures tend to ease. But if I have to say one was more prevalent than the other, I'd say that the labor shortage has been a more pervasive, impactful issue than the actual sort of isolation of the patient's issue."

We are expecting the state has applied for CMS approval for a similar program, which will cover the period from July of '21 to June of '22. We're expecting that program to be approved by CMS. We're expecting the benefit for our Kentucky hospitals to be something comparable to what we've recorded in the previous fiscal year. But we'll wait to record that until the final CMS approval is granted. We're hoping and maybe expecting that, that will be before the end of the calendar year. But no guarantee of that, but we'll record it when we get it. 
As far as DSRIP goes, I think that Texas DSRIP program will either -- it's either going to continue for a period of time or will be replaced by a comparable program. And therefore, I think the amount of DSRIP dollars should not really change significantly going forward."

I mean I think what we have seen throughout the pandemic is that the lowest acuity procedures that we would tend to have as part of our emergency room traffic, et cetera, were those that fell away early on and to a degree, I think, remain those that have not returned. 
So while I think the increase in acuity is driven mostly by the COVID patients themselves, I do think that when you look at the non-COVID cohort of patients, that acuity has also increased slightly. And I'm not sure it's because we're seeing more acute procedures as much as we're seeing sort of the absence of some of that really lower acuity stuff. And honestly, I'm not sure we know exactly where that's gone, but it seems to have fallen away from the hospital emergency rooms."

We continue to sort of work at that. But I don't envision that the managed care pricing dynamic has really changed a great deal during the pandemic or is likely to change significantly coming out of the pandemic."

And then bigger picture-wise, when you think about recruiting new grads into psych as opposed to acute, do you think the hourly wage gap between those 2 segments has to shrink?"

I mean, again, I'm going to make the point that I've made before. I mean I think that the COVID crisis has created an opportunity for nurses, both acute and behavioral nurses, to earn wage rates that are just beyond anything that has been previously comparable. Again, it sounds like you've done a lot of research. You know you're going to have to do a ton. But if you go online and look for nursing opportunities, you can see that there are nursing opportunities in which nurses can easily earn $10,000 a week working in a COVID environment.
So these are nurses who maybe are earning $70,000 or $80,000 a year, maybe $80,000 or $90,000 a year. But now they're earning at a rate of $500,000 a year. So when you have those sort of opportunities, there's no way we can close that gap. That gap will be closed by the elimination of those opportunities. So that, I think, is the issue.
And again, I think the comment that we were making before, I was making before is while we've hired a record number of -- and not just nurses, by the way, this includes therapists and mental health tech, et cetera, we're seeing quite a bit of churn. And again, as you know, I mean I think the American labor force in general is seeing quite a bit of churn. Obviously, I think it's more exacerbated in health care and in hospitals. But it is a bit of a dynamic that we're seeing across the labor landscape.
So we continue -- in every market, we've always spent time making sure that our wages are competitive and performing compensation studies, et cetera. We're more attuned to that now and are doing it more frequently than we've ever had before. And we certainly acknowledge that, particularly, we've got to be competitive with our peers, with other behavioral hospitals, et cetera. But a behavioral nurse is always going to be able to make more money in an ICU setting or an ER setting than in a behavioral setting.
Again, I've talked to many, many nurses, both acute and behavioral, over the years. And I think for the most part, they work where they work because they enjoy the patient care dynamics in the setting in which they work. And again, when there's a 10% or 20% pay differential, I think nurses can convince themselves that they want to work where they're happier. When there's a 400% or 500% differential, that becomes a tougher argument to make."
