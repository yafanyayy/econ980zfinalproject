The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. In addition, the press release financials include description of new segment reporting for our EMEA and other nonreportable segments. 
Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our new President; and Scott Morrison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks; Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends; Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company. 
First, let me begin by thanking our employees. Together, we were able to adapt, work safely, serve our customers and hire thousands of new colleagues amidst unprecedented growth and external challenges. Your empathy, flexibility, adaptability and can-do spirit are remarkable. So thank you. I also want to thank our customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate as well. This past year has put a profound challenges on all of us and our ability to work with each of you for the betterment of all is not taken for granted by us. We're truly blessed as an organization and as a family of all employees to work with you all. And together, we have persevered. 
2020 finished strong with full year comparable diluted earnings per share up 17%. Full year comparable net earnings up 14% and EVA dollars up 25%. Momentum continues across our businesses with full year and fourth quarter global beverage volumes up 5% and 12%, respectively, and won net book backlog in aerospace is up 30% year-over-year. 
The growth trajectory in our packaging and aerospace businesses, our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and our execution on growth capital investments give us even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars and cash from operations. Together, these elements will enhance a significant return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. 
Our focus remains on working safely, executing on capital investments, leveraging our product portfolio and technologies, enhancing the customer experience and investing in talent, training, processes and systems to deliver long-term value. 
Before I turn it over to Dan to discuss our business performance, we've had a variety of well-deserved promotions since our last earnings call, and I want to congratulate everyone, including but not limited to: Dan, Scott Morrison, Lisa Polly, Ron Lewis, Kerry Cozy, Dave Kaufman, Charles Johnson and Jay Billings on their well-deserved promotions as well as to Stan Platt on his upcoming retirement and many contributions to ball. 
Our long-standing succession planning process is thorough and thoughtful. In 2020, our employee base is up over 3,500 people to serve the sizable amount of growth in front of us. With our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity happening as I speak, this is a perfect time to further engage our rising leaders while leveraging long-standing Ball mentors to support their success to create equal opportunities for each and every one of us at Ball. 
Other highlights in 2020 include: our global beverage business has completed or is completing the start-up and speed up of numerous lines in the U.S., EMEA and Brazil as well as announcing additional projects to install at least 25 billion units of contracted capacity by the end of 2023. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully closed on the aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. Our cups team constructed and started up our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility in preparation for our expanded 2021 retail launch, which we expect shortly. 
Our businesses have significantly increased employee training and development to ensure smooth startups of our various projects as well as hosted a variety of virtual programs to help our new folks get up to speed on who we are, where we're going and what's important, whether it be behaving like true owners to our EVA mindset or providing inclusivity programs to help foster immersion into the Ball culture. And we further drove our sustainability leadership to ensure that the aluminum packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world, whether it be publishing third-party reviewed life cycle analysis that independently verified aluminum packaging as the best substrate relative to its carbon footprint; finalized approval of our science-based targets that's in alignment with the 1.5-degree Celsius targets of the intergovernmental panel on climate change; implemented several renewable energy programs; achieved system-wide performance of GANA custody ASI certification in our EMEA business or launch plans to achieve ASI certification in our remaining regions. 
In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength, and our future is getting even brighter. Despite the rise in global COVID-19 cases in the geographies where we operate, nothing is slowing us down in our businesses, and we are excited to bring additional capacity and infrastructure online as quickly and as safely as possible in 2021 and beyond. 
To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan. Dan?"

This is a company that means a great deal to me and has for the last 11 years. In my estimation, the future of Ball has never been brighter, and I look forward to continuing that trajectory with our over 22,000 team members for years to come. 
Transitioning to how we ended the year, I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We all became closer during 2020, a silver lining for sure. Our HR and environmental health and safety professionals and packaging and aerospace continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. And in certain regions outside of the U.S., our teams have facilitated access to additional health care services for our employees and their family members impacted by COVID-19. Thank you again. You are saving lives. 
First, I'll spend some time discussing global beverage and then move on to our aerospace performance and outlook. In 2020, global beverage volumes were up 5% despite the difficult second quarter in South America and EMEA. Specialty mix increased to 46%, operating earnings were up 8%, and we increased EVA dollars 40%. We also secured new customer and supply chain contracts; refocused on customer experience with the new customer portal, The Source; began manufacturing the aluminum cup at scale; expanded our team to ensure our growth is properly resourced; elevated a diverse group of leaders across management, engineering, commercial and procurement. And as John mentioned, we made significant progress in commercializing sustainability. The team truly delivered amidst challenging circumstances. 
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and every day is leading to even more opportunities as consumers and customers continue to leverage sustainable aluminum packaging with their brands and product extensions. It is vital in 2021 that we effectively manage complexity, support a resilient and agile supply chain, deliver a great customer experience and through sustainability in our product portfolio, continue to broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. And though it is only February, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve these goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in aspiration we first discussed at our 2018 Investor Day. 
By 2025, we continue to believe that the industry will go by at least 100 billion units, and Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units given our scale and capabilities in the world's largest can markets. By the end of 2023, we will have installed 25 billion units of capacity to support our customers' filling capacity expansions and product portfolio growth. Contractual terms and conditions are favorable. We have primed the supply chain by entering into multiyear contracts for equipment, next-gen coatings and metal supply. And of course, adhere to our EVA discipline in every facet of these preparations. 
Now we execute. At present and despite 7 billion units plus of annual run rate capacity coming online, demand continues to outstrip supply across North America, South America and our EMEA business. Therefore, the timing and size of capacity additions coming online will influence quarterly year-over-year growth rates. 
So let's not get distracted by any short-term data points. Simply put, this is a significant multiyear growth story from a highly cash-generative company that has an established proven growth rate with the wherewithal and flexibility to invest more and return a lot of value to fellow shareholders along the journey. We are thankful to be able to add skilled manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and elsewhere to help the global economy recover. 
As we look forward, to minimize startup costs and provide our customers the best experience with Ball, execution will be key. I'm happy to report that our new lines in Fort Worth and Rome are running at speed, that our new Glendale, Arizona plant started up its initial line recently, and that incremental line -- lines have already been installed in Glendale to support our customers' successful filling operation startup located adjacent to our facility. Also in our new Pittston, Pennsylvania plant, preparations are being made to ramp up much needed capacity in the second half of 2021. In addition, we will be executing additional investments across our North American footprint, including construction of a new in-manufacturing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to align can and end availability. We anticipate the end facility coming online in 2022. 
As we look out across our global plant network outside of the U.S., we announced this month our intention to open a new 2-line beverage can plant in the Czech Republic, and our new 2-line beverage can plant in Frutal, Brazil will supply additional cans to the fast-growing Brazilian can market in late 2021. 
In North America beverage, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 11% and 6%, respectively. Specialty mix improved to 34%. Going forward, we see volume growth greater than 6% over the next 3 to 5 years and continued growth in specialty, all supported by longer duration contracts. In the fourth quarter, given the scale of new capacity coming online and labor to support them, start-up costs offset the benefit of improved volume and mix. In 2021, start-up costs will continue throughout the year, given the continued pace of growth and are expected to be North American-centric and in the range of 50 million, with volume growth supported by new capacity improved contractual terms and mix will more than be offsetting their impact. 
We continue to prioritize growth opportunities in North America and look forward to discussing additional plans throughout 2021 and 2022. Despite the industry capacity coming online, we see the demand continuing to outstrip supply well into 2023. And depending on our customers' rate of capacity expansion, possibly beyond. 
In EMEA, segment volume for the full year and fourth quarter was up 5% and 20%, respectively, and specialty mix increased to 54%. Across all EMEA business, demand trends improved throughout the year, and positive momentum has continued into 2021. Additional capital projects completed across the region provided needed capacity, and we foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits in 2021 and beyond. 
Future growth will be supported by new categories utilizing cans and projects like the new Czech plant as well as other regional opportunities. Tight supply/demand continues, and we will assess all future opportunities through the lens of EVA. 
In South America, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 12% and 11%, respectively, driven by increased package mix for aluminum cans in the beer category, resulting in our specialty mix growing to 62%. Following a difficult second quarter, beverage cans have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates and package mix on the shelf remains in the 60% range versus a rate of 50% at the end of first quarter 2020. 
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid to high teens and can mix on the shelf remaining high beyond 2020 and supported by investments like our new Frutal facility. 
In summary, our global beverage team, now led by Ron Lewis, navigated a dynamic and challenging year through sheer will and controlling the things we can control. We also thank our teams in India, Saudi Arabia and global joint ventures for supporting our global regions and much-needed support during 2020 and beyond. 
Sticking with global packaging. Our aluminum aerosol team did an amazing job during a challenging year. Earnings increased slightly despite a 3% decline in global volumes due to diminished use of deodorants and hair care products during global corn teams. The team pivoted to new categories, managed costs, integrated an acquisition and positioned our infinity refillable, reclosable sustainability solution for personal care lotions and shampoos, now in plastics. And as John mentioned, our cups team continued to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. Following the company's $20 million plus investment to stand up the business, we expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. 
Turning to aerospace. Full year and fourth quarter operating earnings improved 9% and 5%, respectively. Impressive results given a variety of inefficiencies brought about by operating the business during the current COVID environment, which I'm happy to address during Q&A. Rest assured, there is no change in our ability to grow. Our team persevered and has not lost any momentum, winning new work and bringing on new talent to support our growth. We also executed on new infrastructure, won new study contracts, upgraded tools and systems and increased our unfunded backlog, 30% year-over-year. We continue to be very excited about the long-term prospects of this business as well. And on a personal note, I look forward to leveraging Dave Kaufman's extensive industry knowledge as we both assume our new roles. 
Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up and stay safe. It's going to be another amazing year. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

I'll focus my comments specifically on the fourth quarter and key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Comparable fourth quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.81 versus $0.71 in 2019, an increase of 14%. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage and aerospace segment results, a lower share count and lower interest expense, offset by higher corporate costs and start-up and labor costs, related to our new cups business and new U.S. beverage can facilities. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. 
Taking into account the dynamic growth in our businesses and the necessary speed to market for ongoing initiatives, we invested $1.1 billion in CapEx in 2020, while also returning $275 million to our shareholders. All in, an excellent year. The business and balance sheet are strong. EVA dollars are growing, and we're ready for the next stair-step in growth. 
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 19%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million, roughly flat with the past year. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable is expected to be in the range of $80 million as we support our larger and growing businesses. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will continue to grow, in line with the earnings trajectory. And longer term, we see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. As we discussed at last year's Investor Day, we'll be investing even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity in North America, EMEA and South America, while also investing in our aluminum cups business. And currently expect 2021 CapEx to be in excess of $1.5 billion. Beyond 2021, multiyear internal investments to serve organic growth and that returns well above our 9% after-tax rate will continue. 
Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities, with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our growing operating cash flow, we're managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively, and with the flexibility of returning even more value to our long-term shareholders in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth while delivering significant value to our shareholders as we embark upon our 141st year in operation. 
As we sit here today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share greater than our long-term goal of 10% to 15% and achieve or exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond is certainly our expectation. Our teams working together will do everything possible to outperform, work safely and execute on capital investments. Our time is now, and we are thankful to look at 2021 as a year of promise and great opportunity. And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions."

I mean, if you look at the $25 million of incremental cost, about half of that is start-up and about half of that is just increased labor to support the total growth in the business. If you look at it from that perspective -- and then also, remember, we were importing quite a few cans in the fourth quarter, and the margins on those incremental cans from a mix standpoint aren't going to be as good as what you would normally get. So as we ramp up this capacity, we'll need to do that less. And so margins will improve. And the mix will improve over time, too, as most of the capacity we're putting in is specialty, so I would expect. And in 2021, we the profitability will grow. But remember, I think we mentioned that there's probably $50 million of start-up costs that we'll see in 2021 that will dampen those margins. You'll see most of that in the first half of the year as we ramp up these big facilities, Glendale and Pittston and start on Bowling Green as well. But I think long term, we're going to like these investments a lot because they've achieved much better than our 9% after-tax target."

So I'll give you a little color and characterization of why this is happening. Obviously, there's a huge incumbent in Brazil that has historically leaned a little bit more into returnable glass. And a series of competitors have come in, and they've done really well with different offerings, principally in the beer space, all in cans. And I think they have, over the last 3 to 5 years, we've talked about and we've seen can penetration. I think the end consumer is kind of liking that. The grocery store and retail operators like that. They don't want to carry these returnable glass bottles. And so that influence has continued to grow, and I think the large incumbent is shifting as well to offer what the end consumer wants. To characterize a -- I think what we were talking about back in our -- earlier this summer, when we were talking about or in 2020 when we had our shareholder day, Investor Day, we were characterizing growth. And we were thinking incremental lifts probably from the low 50s to the mid-50s in terms of can penetration. And so that delta versus a 60% to low 60, it could be 4 billion to 5 billion cans in the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are -- that number that we quoted today in our prepared comments, that was in the third quarter, I believe it was like in the high 60s. And so we're operating now in kind of what could be a more normalized run rate. But given COVID and everything that's going on, we'll have to see how that meters out over the next quarters and years. But we're still bullish on incremental advancement. And even at 60%, you referenced that versus North America where can penetration in the beer space is north of 70%. I think there's a real good opportunity to see that kind of get to 60, hover at 60, maybe even get to the upper ends there. But again, we'll have to follow that quarter-by-quarter."

Many of our customers, we recognize that they have profit pools within the plastic industry and they're candidly trying to protect that. I would, too. I don't -- I completely understand where they're coming from. But the brutal reality is when you think about the amount of actually even usable recycled material in plastic, it's still in the single digits. Will chemical recycling change that? Yes, it could, but not on a wholesale basis because there's costs involved in doing that. And furthermore, it's not going to fundamentally change that we have a single-use plastic problem in the world full stop. And when you have recycling rates of beverage cans, above 70%, and we have publicly stated goals to try and get them as an industry above 90%, that means that you're not having any substantial product of aluminum going into landfills and otherwise polluting the environment, I think it's a tall put as we sit here right now to think about plastic and even get close to what we've already been achieving."

The other one is kind of the on-premise, off-premise because the off-premise has benefited at the expense of the on-premise. But our conversations with the on-premise suggest that when we go back, the question is, for example, in beer, how much draft is going to be there when you have glasses sitting there, and people are going to have concerns about the sanitization thereof.

They've overwhelmingly been in cans, but there have been an awful lot of other products because they can't find cans that haven't been released. And so even if there's going to be a shift in terms of consumption patterns and volume and folks do go back to bars, we understand that, that's going to happen. I think there's still an awful lot of pent-up demand and innovation that is going to, hopefully, offset that. And in aggregate, when we look at that, again, this is why we think what we said at our Investor Day, we're there or thereabouts or potentially even better, depending on what happens with these end-consumer behavior patterns coming out of COVID."

What do you do from here so less than the effect? Or should we really bake in a $50 million kind of ongoing start-up cost every year, given the degree to which capacity is growing? And given the CapEx ramp this year, should we not expect an accelerated pickup in operating cash flow because you start to get the return on that in 2022?

The Czech Republic launch will be less because the labor is a heck of a lot less. So you can break people and South America is a lot less with Frutal. That will be less because the labor base just isn't as expensive. And to Dan's point, we found through previous startups, bringing these people in earlier, getting them trained, having redundancy is really important to make sure that then you kind of hit your start-up curve. So I would say it will track with greenfield facility that will be elevated with greenfield facilities in North America, but you're still going to get more than that benefit through the growth in operating cash flow and earnings as these things ramp up."

So it's really everywhere. I think you asked about Northern Europe, but it's everywhere in Europe. The million dollar question, the million dollar EVA question that you asked is what's happening in Europe, which is different than North America and South America, North America and South America got tight, a lot tighter, a lot faster over the last 18 months. And we're starting to see that in Europe right now. And that's sort of what you need in order to reevaluate the landscape of your contracts. I will tell you at the gross profit line, we do really well in Europe.

I think in Brazil, particularly, there is -- you're dealing with tax structures and the longevity of what the folks that you would expect to see significant shifts or a more normalized package mix, a lot of it just has to do with where they make their money and the profit pools associated with that. Having said that, sustainability is becoming more and more something that all of the countries in South America are concerned about. And that will continue to build and put pressure on helping to make that shift. I think we need a combination of a more neutral tax structure on the different disparate profit pools, coupled with sustainability trends to continue to improve. The one thing that's incredibly bullish, though, is, as you said, the overwhelming beverage market for cans in beer, and that pack mix continues to shift to cans. And a lot of new innovation is coming out in the alcohol market in cans as well. So not too dissimilar to what you've seen in the last decade, North America, more recent from an innovation standpoint.

It may not be localized exactly where we want it, depending on performance of all the mills, but we have access to metal, which is the most important thing right now. And all the conversations we're having with the supply base, ,to your point, it's get it where we're making the cans, get it close to the facilities, get it close to where the recycling and scrap stream is because all of that going to enable us to step into all these tremendous attributes of the can.

This past year has put profound challenges on all of us and our ability to work with each of you for the betterment of all is not taken for granted by us. We're truly blessed as an organization and as a family of Ball employees to work with you all. And together, we have persevered. 
2020 finished strong with full year comparable diluted earnings per share up 17%, full year (sic) [ fourth quarter ] comparable net earnings up 14% and EVA dollars up 25%. Momentum continues across our businesses with full year and fourth quarter global beverage volumes up 5% and 12%, respectively, and won-not-booked backlog in aerospace is up 30% year-over-year. 
The growth trajectory in our packaging and aerospace businesses, our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and our execution on growth capital investments give us even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars and cash from operations. Together, these elements will enhance a significant return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. 
Our focus remains on working safely, executing on capital investments, leveraging our product portfolio and technologies, enhancing the customer experience and investing in talent, training, processes and systems to deliver long-term value. 
Before I turn it over to Dan to discuss our business performance, we've had a variety of well-deserved promotions since our last earnings call. And I want to congratulate everyone, including but not limited to, Dan, Scott Morrison, Lisa Pauley, Ron Lewis, Carey Causey, Dave Kaufman, Charles Johnson and Jay Billings on their well-deserved promotions as well as to Stan Platek on his upcoming retirement and many contributions to Ball. 
Our long-standing succession planning process is thorough and thoughtful. In 2020, our employee base is up over 3,500 people to serve the sizable amount of growth in front of us. With our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity happening as I speak, this is a perfect time to further engage our rising leaders while leveraging long-standing Ball mentors to support their success to create equal opportunities for each and every one of us at Ball. 
Other highlights in 2020 include: Our global beverage business has completed or is completing the start-up and speed up of numerous lines in the U.S., EMEA and Brazil as well as announcing additional projects to install at least 25 billion units of contracted capacity by the end of 2023. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully closed on the aluminum aerosol manufacturing plant acquisition in Brazil. Our cups team constructed and started up our first dedicated aluminum cups manufacturing facility in preparation for our expanded 2021 retail launch, which we expect shortly. 
Our businesses have significantly increased employee training and development to ensure smooth start-ups of our various projects as well as hosted a variety of virtual programs to help our new folks get up to speed on who we are, where we're going and what's important, whether it be behaving like true owners to our EVA mindset or providing inclusivity programs to help foster immersion into the Ball culture. And we further drove our sustainability leadership to ensure that the aluminum packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world, whether it be publishing third-party reviewed life cycle analysis that independently verified aluminum packaging as the best substrate relative to its carbon footprint; finalized approval of our science-based targets that's in alignment with the 1.5-degree Celsius targets of the intergovernmental panel on climate change; implemented several renewable energy programs; achieved system-wide performance of Chain of Custody and ASI Certification in our EMEA business; or launch plans to achieve ASI Certification in our remaining regions. 
In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength, and our future is getting even brighter. Despite the rise in global COVID-19 cases in the geographies where we operate, nothing is slowing us down in our businesses, and we are excited to bring additional capacity and infrastructure online as quickly and as safely as possible in 2021 and beyond. 
To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan. Dan?"

It is certainly humbling to step into my new role as President. This is a company that means a great deal to me and has for the last 11 years. In my estimation, the future of Ball has never been brighter, and I look forward to continuing that trajectory with our over 22,000 team members for years to come. 
Transitioning to how we ended the year, I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We all became closer during 2020, a silver lining for sure. Our HR and environmental health and safety professionals and packaging and aerospace continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. And in certain regions outside of the U.S., our teams have facilitated access to additional health care services for our employees and their family members impacted by COVID-19. Thank you again. You are saving lives. 
First, I'll spend some time discussing global beverage and then move on to our aerospace performance and outlook. In 2020, global beverage volumes were up 5% despite the difficult second quarter in South America and EMEA. Specialty mix increased to 46%, operating earnings were up 8% and we increased EVA dollars 40%. We also secured new customer and supply chain contracts; refocused on customer experience with the new customer portal, The Source; began manufacturing the aluminum cup at scale; expanded our team to ensure our growth is properly resourced; elevated a diverse group of leaders across management, engineering, commercial and procurement. And as John mentioned, we made significant progress in commercializing sustainability. The team truly delivered amidst challenging circumstances. 
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and every day is leading to even more opportunities as consumers and customers continue to leverage sustainable aluminum packaging with their brands and product extensions. It is vital in 2021 that we effectively manage complexity, support a resilient and agile supply chain, deliver a great customer experience and through sustainability in our product portfolio, continue to broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. And though it is only February, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve these goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in aspiration we first discussed at our 2018 Investor Day. 
By 2025, we continue to believe that the industry will go by at least 100 billion units, and Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units given our scale and capabilities in the world's largest can markets. By the end of 2023, we will have installed 25 billion units of capacity to support our customers' filling capacity expansions and product portfolio growth. Contractual terms and conditions are favorable. We have primed the supply chain by entering into multiyear contracts for equipment, next-gen coatings and metal supply. And of course, adhere to our EVA discipline in every facet of these preparations. Now we execute. 
At present and despite 7 billion units plus of annual run rate capacity coming online, demand continues to outstrip supply across North America, South America and our EMEA business. Therefore, the timing and size of capacity additions coming online will influence quarterly year-over-year growth rates. 
So let's not get distracted by any short-term data points. Simply put, this is a significant, multiyear growth story from a highly cash-generative company that has an established proven growth rate with the wherewithal and flexibility to invest more and return a lot of value to fellow shareholders along the journey. We are thankful to be able to add skilled manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and elsewhere to help the global economy recover. 
As we look forward, to minimize start-up costs and provide our customers the best experience with Ball, execution will be key. I'm happy to report that our new lines in Fort Worth and Rome are running at speed; that our new Glendale, Arizona plant started up its initial line recently; and that incremental line -- lines have already been installed in Glendale to support our customers' successful filling operation start-up located adjacent to our facility. Also in our new Pittston, Pennsylvania plant, preparations are being made to ramp up much needed capacity in the second half of 2021. In addition, we will be executing additional investments across our North American footprint, including construction of a new end manufacturing facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to align can and end availability. We anticipate the end facility coming online in 2022. 
As we look out across our global plant network outside of the U.S., we announced this month our intention to open a new 2-line beverage can plant in the Czech Republic, and our new 2-line beverage can plant in Frutal, Brazil will supply additional cans to the fast-growing Brazilian can market in late 2021. 
In North America beverage, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 11% and 6%, respectively. Specialty mix improved to 34%. Going forward, we see volume growth greater than 6% over the next 3 to 5 years and continued growth in specialty, all supported by longer duration contracts. 
In the fourth quarter, given the scale of new capacity coming online and labor to support them, start-up costs offset the benefit of improved volume and mix. In 2021, start-up costs will continue throughout the year, given the continued pace of growth and are expected to be North American-centric and in the range of [ $50 million ], with volume growth supported by new capacity, improved contractual terms and mix will more than be offsetting their impact. 
We continue to prioritize growth opportunities in North America and look forward to discussing additional plans throughout 2021 and 2022. Despite the industry capacity coming online, we see the demand continuing to outstrip supply well into 2023. And depending on our customers' rate of capacity expansion, possibly beyond. 
In EMEA, segment volume for the full year and fourth quarter was up 5% and 20%, respectively, and specialty mix increased to 54%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends improved throughout the year, and positive momentum has continued into 2021. Additional capital projects completed across the region provided needed capacity, and we foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits in 2021 and beyond. 
Future growth will be supported by new categories utilizing cans and projects like the new Czech plant as well as other regional opportunities. Tight supply/demand continues, and we will assess all future opportunities through the lens of EVA. 
In South America, full year and fourth quarter volumes were up 12% and 11% (sic) [ 11% and 12% ], respectively, driven by increased package mix for aluminum cans in the beer category, resulting in our specialty mix growing to 62%. Following a difficult second quarter, beverage cans have been very resilient, with store owners leveraging recyclable aluminum cans over other substrates and package mix on the shelf remains in the 60% range versus a rate of 50% at the end of first quarter 2020. 
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid- to high teens and can mix on the shelf remaining high beyond 2020 and supported by investments like our new Frutal facility. 
In summary, our global beverage team, now led by Ron Lewis, navigated a dynamic and challenging year through sheer will and controlling the things we can control. We also thank our teams in India, Saudi Arabia and global joint ventures for supporting our global regions and much-needed support during 2020 and beyond. 
Sticking with global packaging. Our aluminum aerosol team did an amazing job during a challenging year. Earnings increased slightly despite a 3% decline in global volumes due to diminished use of deodorants and hair care products during global quarantines. The team pivoted to new categories, managed costs, integrated an acquisition and positioned our Infinity refillable, reclosable sustainability solution for personal care lotions and shampoos, now in plastics. And as John mentioned, our cups team continued to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. Following the company's $20 million plus investment to stand up the business, we expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. 
Turning to aerospace. Full year and fourth quarter operating earnings improved 9% and 5%, respectively. Impressive results given a variety of inefficiencies brought about by operating the business during the current COVID environment, which I'm happy to address during Q&A. 
Rest assured, there is no change in our ability to grow. Our team persevered and has not lost any momentum, winning new work and bringing on new talent to support our growth. We also executed on new infrastructure, won new study contracts, upgraded tools and systems and increased our unfunded backlog, 30% year-over-year. We continue to be very excited about the long-term prospects of this business as well. And on a personal note, I look forward to leveraging Dave Kaufman's extensive industry knowledge as we both assume our new roles. 
Thank you again to all of our teams around the globe. Your leadership has been nothing short of remarkable. Keep it up and stay safe. It's going to be another amazing year. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

I'll focus my comments specifically on the fourth quarter and key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Comparable fourth quarter 2020 diluted earnings per share were $0.81 versus $0.71 in 2019, an increase of 14%. Fourth quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage and aerospace segment results, a lower share count and lower interest expense, offset by higher corporate costs and start-up and labor costs, related to our new cups business and new U.S. beverage can facilities. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility in the current environment. 
Taking into account the dynamic growth in our businesses and the necessary speed to market for ongoing initiatives, we invested $1.1 billion in CapEx in 2020, while also returning $275 million to our shareholders. All in, an excellent year. The business and balance sheet are strong. EVA dollars are growing. And we're ready for the next stair-step in growth. 
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will be in the range of 19%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million, roughly flat with the past year. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable is expected to be in the range of $80 million as we support our larger and growing businesses. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will continue to grow, in line with the earnings trajectory. And longer term, we see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. As we discussed at last year's Investor Day, we'll be investing even more growth CapEx to expand aerospace facilities, beverage can production capacity in North America, EMEA and South America, while also investing in our aluminum cups business. And currently expect 2021 CapEx to be in excess of $1.5 billion. Beyond 2021, multiyear internal investments to serve organic growth and that returns well above our 9% after-tax rate will continue. 
Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities, with consistent return of value to our shareholders. Given our growing operating cash flow, we're managing the business appropriately for the long term, investing capital with an eye on EVA returns, managing our balance sheet effectively and with the flexibility of returning even more value to our long-term shareholders in 2021 and beyond. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

In summary, our Drive for 10 vision served us very well over the past decade and indeed in 2020, whether it be broadening our geographic expansion, developing new customers, markets and products and doing so with a commitment to being close to our customers and with uncompromising integrity. Ball continues to be uniquely positioned to lead and invest in sustainable growth while delivering significant value to our shareholders as we embark upon our 141st year in operation. 
As we sit here today, our ability to grow comparable diluted earnings per share greater than our long-term goal of 10% to 15% and achieve or exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond is certainly our expectation. Our teams working together will do everything possible to outperform, work safely and execute on capital investments. Our time is now, and we are thankful to look at 2021 as a year of promise and great opportunity. 
And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions."

If -- I mean if you look at the $25 million of incremental cost, about half of that is start-up and about half of that is just increased labor to support the total growth in the business. If you look at it from that perspective -- and then also, remember, we were importing quite a few cans in the fourth quarter, and the margins on those incremental cans from a mix standpoint aren't going to be as good as what you would normally get. So as we ramp up this capacity, we'll need to do that less. And so margins will improve. And the mix will improve over time, too, as most of the capacity we're putting in is specialty, so I would expect. 
And in 2021, we the profitability will grow. But remember, I think we mentioned that there's probably $50 million of start-up costs that we'll see in 2021 that will dampen those margins. You'll see most of that in the first half of the year as we ramp up these big facilities, Glendale and Pittston and start on Bowling Green as well. But I think long term, we're going to like these investments a lot because they've achieved much better than our 9% after-tax target."

So I'll give you a little color and characterization of why this is happening. Obviously, there's a huge incumbent in Brazil that has historically leaned a little bit more into returnable glass. And a series of competitors have come in, and they've done really well with different offerings, principally in the beer space, all in cans. And I think they have, over the last 3 to 5 years, we've talked about and we've seen can penetration. I think the end consumer is kind of liking that. The grocery store and retail operators like that. They don't want to carry these returnable glass bottles. And so that influence has continued to grow, and I think the large incumbent is shifting as well to offer what the end consumer wants. 
To characterize a -- I think what we were talking about back in our -- earlier this summer, when we were talking about -- or in 2020 when we had our shareholder day, Investor Day, we were characterizing growth. And we were thinking incremental lifts probably from the low 50s to the mid-50s in terms of can penetration. And so that delta versus a 60% to low 60, it could be 4 billion to 5 billion cans in the next 3 to 5 years. And so we are -- that number that we quoted today in our prepared comments, that was in the third quarter, I believe it was like in the high 60s. And so we're operating now in kind of what could be a more normalized run rate. But given COVID and everything that's going on, we'll have to see how that meters out over the next quarters and years. But we're still bullish on incremental advancement. And even at 60%, you referenced that versus North America where can penetration in the beer space is north of 70%. I think there's a real good opportunity to see that kind of get to 60, hover at 60, maybe even get to the upper ends there. But again, we'll have to follow that quarter-by-quarter."

So I referenced it in my opening remarks. We've gone longer in terms of establishing supply agreements to make sure that capacity is there in the supply chain. We've also looked at some of the -- where we've stubbed our toes candidly, historically in new plant start-ups, and a lot of that had to do with -- we didn't hire far enough advance. We didn't train folks. We didn't plan for elements of attrition. So we started hiring more engineers. We started hiring a lot more folks in talent acquisition and training capabilities. We've made a lot of investments there. So you're right. These are big investments, big plants. And I think we've changed how we've operated or thought about operating and starting up facilities.

I don't -- I completely understand where they're coming from. But the brutal reality is when you think about the amount of actually even usable recycled material in plastic, it's still in the single digits. Will chemical recycling change that? Yes, it could, but not on a wholesale basis because there's costs involved in doing that. And furthermore, it's not going to fundamentally change that we have a single-use plastic problem in the world, full stop. And when you have recycling rates of beverage cans above 70%, and we have publicly stated goals to try and get them as an industry above 90%, that means that you're not having any substantial product of aluminum going into landfills and otherwise polluting the environment, I think it's a [ tall put ] as we sit here right now to think about plastic and even get close to what we're -- we've already been achieving."

But we've been spending much more time at home. And I think the consumer were, at large, and we have done some research on that, is much more aware of the waste that we are creating because we have to throw it in our garbage cans every day. We're no longer, as we sit here today, as much of an on-the-go society than we were, and we didn't worry about that. So that's one data point that's important to point out. 
The other one is kind of the on-premise, off-premise. Because the off-premise has benefited at the expense of the on-premise. But our conversations with the on-premise suggest that when we go back, the question is, for example, in beer, how much draft is going to be there when you have glasses sitting there, and people are going to have concerns about the sanitization thereof. And so what we've been hearing and is -- that a lot of the on-premise is looking to go to much more single-use beverages, meaning cans and bottles.

We're -- I don't know what the size of the flex work, work-life balance has shifted in terms of a permanent shift, but that's a very real thing. And we're dealing with it here. I mean we're a company that 80%, 90% of our folks come to work historically before this happened, and we're very much going to be -- we've all realized that we can do our jobs from anywhere with the technology. And if you're doing those from home or you're doing those from your apartment or your studio, you're going to be drinking packaged goods. So the can will benefit, and that will be here for quite some time. 
I think the other thing that we're paying close attention to, and it probably goes without saying, but I'll restate it here, the market is incredibly tight. As a result of that, we know a number of our customers are limiting their innovation releases in cans. So yes, there's been a lot of new products that have come on to the market. They've overwhelmingly been in cans, but there have been an awful lot of other products because they can't find cans that haven't been released. And so even if there's going to be a shift in terms of consumption patterns and volume and folks do go back to bars, we understand that, that's going to happen. I think there's still an awful lot of pent-up demand and innovation that is going to, hopefully, offset that. And in aggregate, when we look at that, again, this is why we think what we said at our Investor Day, we're there or thereabouts or potentially even better, depending on what happens with these end-consumer behavior patterns coming out of COVID."

You've talked about being able to lessen their effect as you've had this high-class problem of trying to build in capacity. What do you do from here to lessen the effect? Or should we really bake in a $50 million kind of ongoing start-up cost every year, given the degree to which capacity is growing?

So you can [ bring ] people -- and South America is a lot less with Frutal. That will be less because the labor base just isn't as expensive. 
And to Dan's point, we found through previous start-ups, bringing these people in earlier, getting them trained, having redundancy is really important to make sure that then you kind of hit your start-up curve. So I would say it will track with greenfield facility that will be elevated with greenfield facilities in North America, but you're still going to get more than that benefit through the growth in operating cash flow and earnings as these things ramp up."

So it's really everywhere. I think you asked about Northern Europe, but it's everywhere in Europe. The million-dollar question, the million-dollar EVA question that you asked is what's happening in Europe, which is different than North America and South America, North America and South America got tight, a lot tighter, a lot faster over the last 18 months. And we're starting to see that in Europe right now. And that's sort of what you need in order to reevaluate the landscape of your contracts. I will tell you at the gross profit line, we do really well in Europe. So I think it's -- it may be as much to do with tightening the terms and conditions, like we have had the opportunity to do with in other parts of the world.

It's a great question. I think in Brazil, particularly, there is -- you're dealing with tax structures and the longevity of what the folks that you would expect to see significant shifts or a more normalized package mix, a lot of it just has to do with where they make their money and the profit pools associated with that. Having said that, sustainability is becoming more and more something that all of the countries in South America are concerned about. And that will continue to build and put pressure on helping to make that shift. I think we need some -- a combination of a more neutral tax structure on the different disparate profit pools, coupled with sustainability trends to continue to improve. 
The one thing that's incredibly bullish, though, is, as you said, the overwhelming beverage market for cans is in beer, and that pack mix continues to shift to cans. And a lot of new innovation is coming out in the alcohol market in cans as well. So not too dissimilar to what you've seen in the last decade, North America, more recent from an innovation standpoint.

We have north of 20 different contracts around the world with mills. And so we're in a good spot. It may not be localized exactly where we want it, depending on performance of all the mills, but we have access to metal, which is the most important thing right now. And all the conversations we're having with the supply base, to your point, it's get it where we're making the cans, get it close to the facilities, get it close to where the recycling and scrap stream is because all of that is going to enable us to step into all these tremendous attributes of the can.

Thank you for taking care of one another and living the Ball culture day in and day out. I also want to thank our customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we are successfully navigating pandemic-related restrictions in certain regions, post-vaccine reopenings in other regions, supply shortages and disruptions across the entirety of our supply chains and investing in growth brands, sustainable aluminum packaging and scientific discovery. The past 15 months have further showcased the resiliency of our industries as well as our ability to communicate and manage appropriately to serve growing consumer and customer demand. 
2021 is off to a strong start with comparable diluted earnings per share up 18%, comparable operating earnings up 12% and global beverage volumes up 8%, despite a couple of disruptions in North -- North and Central America beverage and aerospace that were outside of our control. Momentum continues across our global beverage businesses. Project execution is high, aerospace backlog is solid and hiring continues at a robust pace, all of which will fuel long-term shareholder value creation. 
Even though we left a little on the table in the first quarter, nothing has changed about our prospects. In fact, we have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. Scott will discuss this more later on. 
First quarter 2021 highlights include: our global beverage business completing the startup of 4 new lines and the speed-up of numerous others around the world. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully integrating the Brazil aluminum aerosol plant acquisition. Our cups team executing national distribution of the Ball Aluminum Cup at 7 out of the 10 largest U.S. food and beverage retailers late in the quarter. Our aerospace team continued to successfully test key instruments and win NASA contracts and study programs, and our businesses hired nearly 1,000 people net in the quarter to support our long-term growth. 
We continue to put our shoulders into the areas of sustainability and real circularity to ensure that aluminum beverage packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world. As many know, and you will hear us speak endlessly about, aluminum beverage cans already contain, on average, more than 70% recycled content, which is multiples above any other beverage package. During the quarter, we launched the first ASI-certified can in EMEA and Ball commissioned Eunomia to produce the first U.S. state-by-state comparable assessment of recycling rates for common containers and packaging materials. Please visit our website at ball.com/realcircularity to view our recently published 50 States Recycling Report. 
As state and federal lawmakers consider recycling legislation and infrastructure investment, it's important for everyone to understand what is working and what is not when it comes to recycling in the U.S. And as an industry leader, we believe with good data, smart policies and infrastructure investment, the U.S. can be a leader in the global circular economy. Aluminum packaging is economically advantaged, properly designed and as mentioned, offers the highest recycled content beverage solutions available to our customers today. Increasing U.S. and global recycling rates will only accelerate growth for aluminum packaging versus other substrates and promote a truly circular economy. 
So in summary, Ball is operating from a position of strength. Our future is very bright, and our time is now. To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our new President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"
170352,710507520,2272870,"Ball Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our teams safe and vigilant. As John mentioned, it was a very rewardin",1333,"Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our teams safe and vigilant. 
As John mentioned, it was a very rewarding start to the year. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions and a few curveballs along the way. We're exiting the first quarter with a lot of momentum and we'll continue to see strong performance throughout 2021. 
In addition to global beverage volumes being up 8%, specialty mix increased above 49%, up from 46% at year-end 2020. And ongoing strength in EMEA and South America beverage more than offset the winter storm impact in North America beverage, accelerated marketing investments for our retail Cup launch and COVID-induced subcontractor costs in aerospace. 
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe, despite Ball exiting 2020 with 7 billion units of additional installed capacity. We continue to be sold out and look forward to bringing more projects online. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level and we anticipate exiting 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity, all of which underscores our Investor Day commentary: cans are in high demand, contracts are in place and Ball is well on its way to installing at least 25 billion units of global capacity by year-end 2023. That's off of a base of 100 billion in 2019. 
Our focus on speed-to-market, talent, training, systems, supply chain and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now and you are making this happen, keep up the great work. 
We continue to secure new customer and supply chain contracts as well as properly aligned talent resources for the future. As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,000 colleagues year-to-date, with the majority of them located in the United States. Training and development and immersion into the Ball culture is a vital part of our day-to-day work. 
Can demand across all beverage categories is strong. Our focus on improving customer experience is bearing fruit. Online tools like the source, transparent customer communication and even more can availability will continue to aid that trend. 
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing sustainability. I'm proud to say that in addition to our EMEA segment achieving ASI Certification in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI certification by year-end 2021. In addition, last week, we recognized the 2020 Hoover Sustainability Award Global winners. We commend all of our global colleagues and our global supply chain for their commitment to our sustainability journey. 
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and our product portfolio continues to support our customers' new brands as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. Given market characteristics and our project execution, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. 
We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. As a reminder, for those of you newer to the industry, that is 2x the historical CAGR and puts the industry on track to grow at least 100 billion units by 2025. Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units of that growth given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets. 
Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable and long-standing pass-through mechanisms for aluminum and other items are in place. These include our lift customer terms and conditions that will enable us to ensure full pass-through as inflation begins to ramp up. And as we said on last quarter's earnings, now we execute, execute, execute. 
Now a few comments on each region. In North America, beverage first quarter volumes were up 6% and specialty mix improved to 37%. During the quarter, earnings were down slightly due to the combined effect of project start-up costs and lost production from winter storms, more than offsetting the benefit of improved volume and mix. We anticipate both our Glendale and Pittston facilities to exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green ins manufacturing plant will pull forward its start-up to the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Across the customer base, beverage can demand is strong across all brand categories: alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. We expect this favorable trend to continue and will support additional EVA-enhancing opportunities to align with long-duration contracts. As we have discussed on prior calls, given 3 plants coming online in North America, full year start-up costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million. The impacts of these costs will be weighted more in the first half. 
In EMEA, segment volume for the first quarter was up 5% and specialty mix was 54%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. We foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits throughout 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. 
In South America, first quarter volumes were up 14% and specialty mix increased to nearly 68%, despite only 80% to 85% of delivery channels being open during the recent resurgence of the virus. We continue to see more upside in South America and the Frutal, Brazil plant as well as other projects are progressing very well. We are also anticipating further investments both in Brazil and throughout the region. 
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid-to-high teens and can mix on the shelf returning to even higher levels beyond 2020 once we have more capacity online. In summary, our global beverage team did an amazing job navigating some uncontrollables during the quarter while also executing at a high level on the things we can control. 
Sticking with aluminum packaging. Our aluminum aerosol team did a stellar job managing costs and preparing for reopenings, lifting the odorant and personal care demand. Both earnings and volume increased slightly in the quarter, and the team continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottles to deliver innovation across multiple brand categories. Our cups team continue to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. In addition to the retail launch John mentioned, the team recently kicked off The Party Starts Here marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers preparing for a summer filled with infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We will continue to invest marketing dollars behind the Cups retail launch in 2021 and expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. 
Turning to aerospace. The team continued to win contracts during the quarter, including building the spacecraft for NASA's Heliophysics Glide mission, which will study Earth's exosphere, which is where Earth's atmosphere touches space. The Glide's spacecraft and space weather follow-on spacecraft, also being built by Ball and we'll study solar wins and forecast solar weather will launch together in the future. The aerospace business also dealt with transitory costs due to a first quarter subcontractor rate adjustment associated with the national defense contract and inefficiencies brought about by the current COVID environment. This rate adjustment does not impede the near- or long-term growth prospects for the business. I'm happy to address any of those questions during Q&A. 
Our team also executed on new infrastructure, completed critical testing on multiple instruments, won new study programs and backlog remains solid. We continue to be very excited about the business and appreciate all of the amazing work being done by the aerospace team. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Comparable first quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.72 versus $0.61 in 2020, an increase of 18%. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage results, favorable FX, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate, labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum Cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. 
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 18%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in Other Nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $90 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will follow through as new growth capital products become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and as fellow owners and in alignment with our EVA discipline, we'll prudently balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the first quarter's strength and approaching our net leverage target range as we progress through 2021, I see returning that value in a more meaningful way sooner rather than later. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

We will work together to do everything possible to work safely, execute on capital investments, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and value for our shareholders.

It's a little early for me to speculate on the speed and the rate with which we're adding in 2022. There's still an awful lot of challenges, as you can imagine, in South America with COVID and in Central Europe with COVID. We've got line of sight, as I've indicated, to add 25 billion off of the base in 2019 by 2023, we can still execute against that.

A lot of it is underpinned by returnable glass shifting into cans.

I do think, though, in the month of April, it was kind of interesting because that was the month of year-over-year comparables. And what we saw was overall liquid volume on the alcohol side was down a little bit. Cans were actually up a smidge in that, meaning cans were taking share. And on the soft drink side or the nonalcoholic side, nonalcoholic liquid volume was up and the cans were up as well. So not by huge amounts, but people, I think we're expecting a big decline.

In the last couple of weeks, we've seen north of 60% on site, and that's continuing to build as folks get vaccinated and CDC guidelines are allowing us to bring more folks in-house.

There's -- we're in peak season. We've been oversold for 2 years. We're at historically low inventory levels. We have an incredibly tight supply chain. Our teams are doing things and trying things and trying to be as transparent as we possibly can with customers. The one thing we can do is try to lock in, candidly, a production plan for the balance of the year and try to stick with it as best as we can. That gives our plants the best chance of success. Any alterations, any changes to that are going to put us in very close to a make-to-order environment, which it will be challenging. I think our teams are up for it. We do have capacity coming online, which I've commented on. Those are coming online right in line with our expectations. That will give us some modicum of relief. But yes, our customers are gearing up for a big peak season. They're taking every can we can possibly get. There's a lot of importation happening right now, and it's just going to be tight for the summer. The first quarter did not set us up for the most optimal scenario heading into the second quarter in North America."

So we haven't seen much of what you're describing, but there is always the potential. As we continue to grow, as we have tightness in these domestic markets, as these supply chains in every industry are getting extended, the challenge will be, if we had to dip into non-domestic aluminum, if we had to dip into China, where the overwhelming majority of excess metal is in the world, we know those freight costs are much higher than they were a year ago, 18 months ago, 2 years ago. And the real risk, though, is probably more our ability to potentially pass-through that cost of just getting it hung up in the ports right now.

And when you don't have capacity, they're looking somewhere to get them. And so you're right, the supply chain complexity of bringing cans in from across the world is intense, not only from a cost perspective, but just a complexity of the supply chain perspective. This is why, again, we're trying to get our capacity ramped up as quickly as we can because I think it's going to open the door in terms of incremental innovation by, not only the large customers, but the small customers as well. And there's a number of small customers that were in contact with that they put new can lines in, but they didn't really order ahead in terms of cans.

They're in the market, specifically in the U.K. In South America, we are seeing innovation. I don't think you can underestimate within beer -- the beer category, there's been a huge shift into different ingredients, craft beer, cups from Europe, all of that has been transitory in the last 3 to 4 years, and it's now changed the landscape altogether. Those disruptors in the marketplace that started there, all came out in cans, and that was really the tipping point for the incumbents that had returnable glass to kind of wake up to the fact that we probably need to match what's happening because we're losing share. And so your comment's right, it is returnable glass, but the returnable glass shift, I could probably characterize that it came as a result of innovation and innovation in the cans. And we see that there's still plenty of room for that to grow as I think I indicated in my prepared remarks. Only 51% can penetration in the first quarter, and that's down from north of 60% in the third quarter last year, and that's just a function of tight supply from cans in the marketplace."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. 
The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. 
Now joining me on the call today are Scott -- are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks, Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our outlook for the company. 
First, let me begin by thanking our employees. Together, we are working safely and executing at a high level in preparation for even more growth. Thank you for taking care of one another and living the Ball culture day in and day out. I also want to thank our customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we are successfully navigating pandemic-related restrictions in certain regions, post-vaccine reopenings in other regions, supply shortages and disruptions across the entirety of our supply chains and investing in growth brands, sustainable aluminum packaging and scientific discovery. The past 15 months have further showcased the resiliency of our industries as well as our ability to communicate and manage appropriately to serve growing consumer and customer demand. 
2021 is off to a strong start with comparable diluted earnings per share up 18%, comparable operating earnings up 12% and global beverage volumes up 8%, despite a couple of disruptions in North and Central America beverage and aerospace that were outside of our control. Momentum continues across our global beverage businesses. Project execution is high, aerospace backlog is solid and hiring continues at a robust pace, all of which will fuel long-term shareholder value creation. 
Even though we left a little on the table in the first quarter, nothing has changed about our prospects. In fact, we have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. Scott will discuss this more later on. 
First quarter 2021 highlights include: our global beverage business completing the start-up of 4 new lines and the speed-up of numerous others around the world. Our aluminum aerosol business successfully integrating the Brazil aluminum aerosol plant acquisition. Our cups team executing national distribution of the Ball Aluminum Cup at 7 out of the 10 largest U.S. food and beverage retailers late in the quarter. Our aerospace team continued to successfully test key instruments and win NASA contracts and study programs, and our businesses hired nearly 1,000 people net in the quarter to support our long-term growth. 
We continue to put our shoulders into the areas of sustainability and Real Circularity to ensure that aluminum beverage packaging continues to be the most sustainable package in the world. As many know, and you will hear us speak endlessly about, aluminum beverage cans already contain, on average, more than 70% recycled content, which is multiples above any other beverage package. During the quarter, we launched the first ASI-certified can in EMEA and Ball commissioned Eunomia to produce the first U.S. state-by-state comparable assessment of recycling rates for common containers and packaging materials. Please visit our website at ball.com/realcircularity to view our recently published 50 States Recycling Report. 
As state and federal lawmakers consider recycling legislation and infrastructure investment, it's important for everyone to understand what is working and what is not when it comes to recycling in the U.S. And as an industry leader, we believe with good data, smart policies and infrastructure investment, the U.S. can be a leader in the global circular economy. Aluminum packaging is economically advantaged, properly designed and as mentioned, offers the highest recycled content beverage solutions available to our customers today. Increasing U.S. and global recycling rates will only accelerate growth for aluminum packaging versus other substrates and promote a truly circular economy. 
So in summary, Ball is operating from a position of strength. Our future is very bright, and our time is now. To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your family for good health and continued safety. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our new President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"
170352,710507520,2273158,"Ball Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our teams safe and vigilant. As John mentioned, it was a very rewardin",1335,"Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our teams safe and vigilant. 
As John mentioned, it was a very rewarding start to the year. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions and a few curveballs along the way. We're exiting the first quarter with a lot of momentum and we'll continue to see strong performance throughout 2021. 
In addition to global beverage volumes being up 8%, specialty mix increased above 49%, up from 46% at year-end 2020. And ongoing strength in EMEA and South America beverage more than offset the winter storm impact in North America beverage, accelerated marketing investments for our retail cup launch and COVID-induced subcontractor costs in aerospace. 
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe, despite Ball exiting 2020 with 7 billion units of additional installed capacity. We continue to be sold out and look forward to bringing more projects online. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level and we anticipate exiting 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity, all of which underscores our Investor Day commentary: cans are in high demand, contracts are in place and Ball is well on its way to installing at least 25 billion units of global capacity by year-end 2023. That's off of a base of 100 billion in 2019. 
Our focus on speed-to-market, talent, training, systems, supply chain and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now and you are making this happen, keep up the great work. 
We continue to secure new customer and supply chain contracts as well as properly aligned talent resources for the future. As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,000 colleagues year-to-date, with the majority of them located in the United States. Training and development and immersion into the Ball culture is a vital part of our day-to-day work. 
Can demand across all beverage categories is strong. Our focus on improving customer experience is bearing fruit. Online tools like The Source, transparent customer communication and even more can availability will continue to aid that trend. 
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing sustainability. I'm proud to say that in addition to our EMEA segment achieving ASI Certification in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI certification by year-end 2021. In addition, last week, we recognized the 2020 Hoover Sustainability Award Global winners. We commend all of our global colleagues and our global supply chain for their commitment to our sustainability journey. 
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and our product portfolio continues to support our customers' new brands as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. Given market characteristics and our project execution, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. 
We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. As a reminder, for those of you newer to the industry, that is 2x the historical CAGR and puts the industry on track to grow at least 100 billion units by 2025. Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units of that growth given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets. 
Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable and long-standing pass-through mechanisms for aluminum and other items are in place. These include our lift customer terms and conditions that will enable us to ensure full pass-through as inflation begins to ramp up. And as we said on last quarter's earnings, now we execute, execute, execute. 
Now a few comments on each region. In North America, beverage first quarter volumes were up 6% and specialty mix improved to 37%. During the quarter, earnings were down slightly due to the combined effect of project start-up costs and lost production from winter storms, more than offsetting the benefit of improved volume and mix. We anticipate both our Glendale and Pittston facilities to exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green ends manufacturing plant will pull forward its start-up to the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Across the customer base, beverage can demand is strong across all brand categories: alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. We expect this favorable trend to continue and will support additional EVA-enhancing opportunities to align with long-duration contracts. As we have discussed on prior calls, given 3 plants coming online in North America, full year start-up costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million. The impacts of these costs will be weighted more in the first half. 
In EMEA, segment volume for the first quarter was up 5% and specialty mix was 54%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. We foresee European beverage can volumes up mid-single digits throughout 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. 
In South America, first quarter volumes were up 14% and specialty mix increased to nearly 68%, despite only 80% to 85% of delivery channels being open during the recent resurgence of the virus. We continue to see more upside in South America and the Frutal, Brazil plant as well as other projects are progressing very well. We are also anticipating further investments both in Brazil and throughout the region. 
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid-to-high teens and can mix on the shelf returning to even higher levels beyond 2020 once we have more capacity online. In summary, our global beverage team did an amazing job navigating some uncontrollables during the quarter while also executing at a high level on the things we can control. 
Sticking with aluminum packaging. Our aluminum aerosol team did a stellar job managing costs and preparing for reopenings, lifting the odorant and personal care demand. Both earnings and volume increased slightly in the quarter, and the team continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottles to deliver innovation across multiple brand categories. Our cups team continue to execute and prepare for an exciting 2021. In addition to the retail launch John mentioned, the team recently kicked off ""the party starts here"" marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers preparing for a summer filled with infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We will continue to invest marketing dollars behind the cups retail launch in 2021 and expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. 
Turning to aerospace. The team continued to win contracts during the quarter, including building the spacecraft for NASA's heliophysics GLIDE mission, which will study Earth's exosphere, which is where Earth's atmosphere touches space. The GLIDE spacecraft and NOAA's Space Weather Follow On spacecraft, also being built by Ball and we'll study solar winds and forecast solar weather will launch together in the future. The aerospace business also dealt with transitory costs due to a first quarter subcontractor rate adjustment associated with the national defense contract and inefficiencies brought about by the current COVID environment. This rate adjustment does not impede the near- or long-term growth prospects for the business. I'm happy to address any of those questions during Q&A. 
Our team also executed on new infrastructure, completed critical testing on multiple instruments, won new study programs and backlog remains solid. We continue to be very excited about the business and appreciate all of the amazing work being done by the aerospace team. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Comparable first quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.72 versus $0.61 in 2020, an increase of 18%. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage results, favorable FX, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate, labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. 
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 18%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million. And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $90 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will follow through as new growth capital products become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash and as fellow owners and in alignment with our EVA discipline, we'll prudently balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Given the first quarter's strength and approaching our net leverage target range as we progress through 2021, I see returning that value in a more meaningful way sooner rather than later. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

We will work together to do everything possible to work safely, execute on capital investments, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and value for our shareholders.

It's a little early for me to speculate on the speed and the rate with which we're adding in 2022. There's still an awful lot of challenges, as you can imagine, in South America with COVID and in Central Europe with COVID. We've got line of sight, as I've indicated, to add 25 billion off of the base in 2019. By 2023, we can still execute against that.

We're running at -- let me -- I'll answer the back half of those questions first. We're running at extraordinarily low inventory levels. Can penetration in the market for Q1 was actually lower than on average what it was all of last year and even the year before, and that's because there's just not enough cans. And so even with the capacity adds that I'm talking about in South America, we're going to be incredibly tight in that region for the foreseeable future. A lot of it is underpinned by returnable glass shifting into cans. So if you reference back to my comments in the script, we're definitely looking into a series of further investments across that region as long as the demand profiles and the contracts look right. We have not had a lot of disruption, and I give our teams a tremendous amount of credit. 
This time a year ago, it was challenging in kind of the Amazon region. But since then, we haven't lost much in terms of production and we've had some -- the stories are incredible, as you can imagine, in terms of what's happening with extended families and loved ones. And that has been the mental aspect of our employee base has been probably more challenging in getting people physically to work in a healthy environment.

I do think, though, in the month of April, it was kind of interesting because that was the month of year-over-year comparables. And what we saw was overall liquid volume on the alcohol side was down a little bit. Cans were actually up a smidge in that, meaning cans were taking share. And on the soft drink side or the nonalcoholic side, nonalcoholic liquid volume was up and the cans were up as well. So not by huge amounts, but people, I think we're expecting a big decline.

I think moving forward, I think we're in a far better place than candidly we've experienced in the last 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind that, historically, and the type of work we do, much of it being classified, folks need to be on site in order to do the work. And so our aerospace business of roughly 5,000 employees today, you would see 80% of those folks would be on site. And if you go back to the end of Q3, beginning of Q4, it was more in the 35% to 40% range. We've begun the transition now. In the last couple of weeks, we've seen north of 60% on site, and that's continuing to build as folks get vaccinated and CDC guidelines are allowing us to bring more folks in-house. So we should see productivity benefits not just for us, but the entire supply chain, which has been disrupted because of this. So we're feeling bullish about this quarter and the back half of the year and returning to some sense of normalcy for that business and increasing productivity and efficiency. So hopefully, that gives you some additional color on kind of what we've been up against."

Any alterations, any changes to that are going to put us in very close to a make-to-order environment, which it will be challenging. I think our teams are up for it. We do have capacity coming online, which I've commented on. Those are coming online right in line with our expectations. That will give us some modicum of relief.

And the real risk, though, is probably more our ability to potentially pass-through that cost of just getting it hung up in the ports right now.

And when you don't have capacity, they're looking somewhere to get them. And so you're right, the supply chain complexity of bringing cans in from across the world is intense, not only from a cost perspective, but just a complexity of the supply chain perspective. This is why, again, we're trying to get our capacity ramped up as quickly as we can because I think it's going to open the door in terms of incremental innovation by not only the large customers, but the small customers as well. And there's a number of small customers that were in contact with that they put new can lines in, but they didn't really order ahead in terms of cans.

So I think innovations are -- it will be a longer supply chain or a longer pipeline for those to show up in a meaningful way. But they're out. They're in the market, specifically in the U.K. 
In South America, we are seeing innovation. I don't think you can underestimate within beer -- the beer category, there's been a huge shift into different ingredients, craft beer, hops from Europe, all of that has been transitory in the last 3 to 4 years, and it's now changed the landscape altogether. Those disruptors in the marketplace that started there, all came out in cans, and that was really the tipping point for the incumbents that had returnable glass to kind of wake up to the fact that we probably need to match what's happening because we're losing share. 
And so your comment's right, it is returnable glass, but the returnable glass shift, I could probably characterize that it came as a result of innovation and innovation in the cans. And we see that there's still plenty of room for that to grow as I think I indicated in my prepared remarks. Only 51% can penetration in the first quarter, and that's down from north of 60% in the third quarter last year, and that's just a function of tight supply from cans in the marketplace."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. 
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. 
Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company. 
To all of our global employees, thank you for your hard work and for staying safe. We know the past 16 months have been trying on everyone, and it's not lost on us that we are not out of the woods yet. COVID is still with us, and the science of the vaccine speak for itself. Please get vaccinated if you can. If not for your shelf, then for your loved one and coworkers. 
In addition, I also want to thank our packaging and aerospace customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we continue to navigate our supply chains, COVID-related restrictions in certain regions due to the ongoing Delta area, reopenings in other regions, and we are experiencing all of this while deploying new EVA-accretive investments, innovations and technologies that will increase the global availability of sustainable aluminum packaging as well as deliver national security, environmental and climate intelligence. 
Our long-term prospects are right on track relative to our expectations. Our business has been very resilient, and we have an exciting future ahead of us. In the second quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were up 32%. Comparable operating earnings were up 22%. Global beverage volumes were up 13%. Global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 20%, and aerospace finished the quarter with record backlog. 
Looking to the second half, growth continues across our global beverage businesses. Aluminum aerosol volumes continue to rise as regions reopen. Our cup team continues to roll out our Ball aluminum cup at more than 20,000 points of retail distribution and is working with even more stadiums and arenas to ramp up the food service side of the business.
Aerospace has multiple launches and hiring continues at an elevated pace to staff aerospace contracts and aluminum packaging manufacturing projects in the U.S., South America and Europe. While we are still working through several supply chain disruptions in our aerospace and North and Central American beverage packaging business that Dan will speak to, we are and will leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses. We have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. To that end, and as Scott will elaborate, we are accelerating our return of value capital allocation strategy given the conviction we have for our future performance.
Second quarter 2021 highlights include, Our global beverage businesses completing the start-up of 6 lines, including 3 in North America, 1 in EMEA and 2 in South America. Our global aluminum aerosol volumes increasing 20%, as I mentioned before. Our cups team executing national retail distribution of the Ball aluminum cup in all 50 states and providing 16-ounce, 20-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum cup to numerous sports and entertainment venues as COVID restrictions moderate. Our aerospace team winning new contracts to lift contracted backlog to a record $3 billion, following a significant win late in the quarter. 
Our 2030 sustainability goals announcement, including ambitions to achieve net 0 carbon emissions, 90% global recycling rates, an 85% recycled content as well as establishing regional D&I goals and a vision of circularity for the aluminum beverage can. Our business is hiring nearly 1,600 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth and normal attrition due to retirements. 
Our Board increased our quarterly dividend 33% and reiterated our 35 million share repurchase authorization, and we plan to purchase in excess of $500 million of stock this year while deploying $1.5 billion in EVA-accretive growth capital investments. 
In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level, standing up new greenfield plants, speeding up lines in existing facilities, bringing new aerospace infrastructure expansions online to support our increasing backlog and hiring amazing talent to join our team. 
To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your families for good health and continued safety. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"

Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions and intermittent supply chain challenges. 
We are entering the second half with a lot of momentum, a few manageable challenges and a visible path to strong performance throughout 2021 and beyond. Second quarter global beverage volumes up 13% versus 2020, and ongoing strength in EMEA and South America offset start-up costs in North America, retail marketing investments for our retail cup launch, the later-than-anticipated award timing for a new aerospace contract and higher year-over-year costs. 
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level. We are on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity, and we recently announced global projects, all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary. Cans are in high demand, contracts are in place, and Ball is well positioned. 
Our focus on speed to market, talent, training, systems and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now, and you are making this happen. Keep up the great work. 
As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,600 colleagues year-to-date, with the majority of them located in the United States. Our investment in talent, training and development and immersion into the Ball culture and EVA mindset is a vital part of near- and long-term success. We are blessed as an organization to attract this talent in the current environment and are committed to their success. 
Can demand across all beverage categories remain strong. Our focus on improving customer experience by expanding can availability via new production coming online and providing our network latitude to build adequate inventory will continue to aid that trend. 
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability. Following EMEA's lead in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI Certification by year-end 2021. And each of our global businesses set specific regional D&I goals as part of our 2030 sustainability goals announcement. Proof points of our progress include women representing over 40% of the new team in one of our Brazilian plant investments. And in aerospace, over 40% of our summer interns and new hires representing ethnic and gender diversity. We commend our global colleagues' commitment to our sustainability journey and also wish to recognize our supply chain's recent investments and sustainability-focused initiatives. 
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and our product portfolio continues to support our customers' new brands as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups. 
Given market characteristics and our project execution, I continue to be very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. Ball is well positioned to capture growth given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets. 
Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable, and long-standing pass-through mechanisms are in place for aluminum and other items. And as we said on last quarter's earnings call, now we execute. 
Now for a few brief comments on each region. In North America, beverage second quarter volumes were up 5% versus 2020 and up 6.4% versus 2019 during the quarter. Earnings were up slightly. And as expected, higher volume offset the combined effect of project start-up costs and operational efficiencies in plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory entering peak season. 
Glendale and Pittston are both operational. And as of today, 3 lines are running in Glendale and Pittston first-line is coming up its learning curve. Both plants will exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green ends manufacturing plant will start up early in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining half of the anticipated $50 million in start-up costs will flow through in the second half of 2021. 
Across our broad customer base, beverage can demand is strong in all brand categories: alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. Despite recent chatter on hard seltzers, nothing has changed about our plans. We expect favorable growth trends across all categories to continue, which will drive more EVA-enhancing opportunities, supported by long duration contracts with strategic customers and large regional accounts. 
In the near term, the work to build adequate inventory levels will offset some of the benefit of having new capacity online during the third quarter and positioned the business for success. 
Looking out longer term, Ball will build another beverage can manufacturing plant in the Southeast. Our new North Carolina facility is supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate the facility to come online in late 2023 or 2024. 
In EMEA, segment volume for the second quarter was up 18% versus 2020 on easier comps given prior year's volume declines due to COVID onset timing and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus second quarter 2019, volumes were up 9%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. 
We foresee European beverage can volumes up high single digits throughout second half of 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. Our new greenfield plants in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key accounts. Our EMEA team is executing very well and fully prepared for these exciting investments. 
In South America, second quarter volumes were up 15% versus 2020 and up 16% versus 2019 given easier comps due to the prior year's COVID impact and despite cooler-than-normal seasonal temperatures and delivery channels in large cities limiting alcohol purchases. We continue to see more earnings upside in South America. As John mentioned, 2 new lines ramped up in existing facilities in South America during the quarter, and the Frutal, Brazil plant is preparing for a late third quarter start-up. Additional investments both in Brazil and throughout the region are also anticipated. 
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid-teens for the full year, and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online. 
In summary, our global beverage team did a terrific job navigating some uncontrollables during the quarter while also executing as well as we can on the things we can control. Our aluminum aerosol team did an excellent job supplying growth across EMEA, resulting in 20% higher volumes in the second quarter globally versus 2020 and 12% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period. The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. In addition, the business continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottles to deliver innovation across multiple brand and product categories, including the second quarter rollout of refillable, reclosable personal care packaging at a leading U.S. mass retailer. 
Our cups team continues to raise awareness, establish distribution, execute initial sell-through and invest for continued growth in 2021 and beyond. In addition to the 50 states retail launch John mentioned, the team continued to invest in the Party Starts Here marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers about infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We continue to expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022. 
Turning to aerospace. The team continued to win contracts, and year-to-date contracted backlog is up 25%. The aerospace business dealt with lingering effects of inefficient supply chains. Though exiting the quarter, we saw notable improvement with key subcontractors, and we are exciting -- excited to book a key contract win at the end of the quarter. This win and the trajectory of recent performance sets up the business for notable sales and earnings growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond in addition to margin improvement beyond 2021. At Ball aerospace, we are managing challenges, nurturing our culture while capturing the future. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done by not only the aerospace team but everyone across the organization. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Comparable second quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus $0.65 in 2020, an increase of 32%. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong global beverage results, slightly lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate costs as well as labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility. 
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 17%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $95 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion, and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new growth projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners, and in alignment with our EVA discipline, we will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. 
Given the second quarter's strength and net leverage in our target range, we will return significant value to shareholders via dividends, as John mentioned earlier, and our ongoing 2021 share repurchase program of at least $500 million. In 2021, we'll return approximately $1 billion to shareholders, including dividends and buybacks, and we intend to double that total return to shareholders in 2022. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

We'll work safely together to execute on projects, support our customers' growth, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and return even more value to our shareholders.

We've seen -- obviously, we participated in the growth of that space, but it is not -- the underpinnings for the things that we've been talking about in terms of long-term securitization of contracts, EVA accretion, it's not on the backs of that category specifically. And so I think it will continue to grow. It's clearly not going to grow at the rate it has been. I think what's been clear in that space is the folks that continue to innovate and innovate effectively are the ones that are taking share. And so from that perspective, we're -- we believe that we have a right to play in the innovation space, and I think we benefit from those customers in particular. And so that's where our focus is. 
I'm leery to comment on unit volumes across the entire space for the back half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense of how we at Ball kind of view that category. We're continuing to bet on the long-term trajectory of the can, and can wins in every channel.

In Europe, that's the lowest can penetration market in terms of substrate penetration anywhere in the world for us outside of Mexico and much the same.

I don't know that I could point to one particular category because I -- we're seeing it across every category. So there's a heavier lean in terms of cans.

In the back half, as these lines ramp up, we've got really good contracts there. We are in constant conversations with the customers, and they're -- they can't wait to get those cans. So I would expect accelerated growth in the back half of the year because of the capacity we put in place."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends. Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on the outlook for the company.
To all of our global employees, thank you for your hard work and for staying safe. We know the past 16 months have been trying on everyone, and it's not lost on us that we are not out of the woods yet. COVID is still with us, and the science of the vaccine speak for itself. Please get vaccinated if you can. If not for yourself, then for your loved ones and coworkers.
In addition, I also want to thank our packaging and aerospace customers, suppliers and their employees. Collectively, we continue to navigate our supply teams, COVID-related restrictions in certain regions due to the ongoing Delta variant, reopenings in other regions, and we are experiencing all of this while deploying new EVA-accretive investments, innovations and technologies that will increase the global availability of sustainable aluminum packaging as well as deliver national security, environmental and climate intelligence.
Our long-term prospects are right on track relative to our expectations. Our business has been very resilient, and we have an exciting future ahead of us. In the second quarter, comparable diluted earnings per share were up 32%, comparable operating earnings were up 22%, global beverage volumes were up 13%, global aluminum aerosol volumes were up 20%, and aerospace finished the quarter with record backlog.
Looking to the second half, growth continues across our global beverage businesses. Aluminum aerosol volumes continue to rise as regions reopen. Our cup team continues to roll out our Ball aluminum cup at more than 20,000 points of retail distribution and is working with even more stadiums and arenas to ramp up the food service side of the business.
Aerospace has multiple launches and hiring continues at an elevated pace to staff aerospace contracts and aluminum packaging manufacturing projects in the U.S., South America and Europe. While we are still working through several supply chain disruptions in our aerospace and North and Central American beverage packaging business that Dan will speak to, we are and will leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses.
We have an even greater conviction in our ability to significantly grow diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return the value to shareholders in 2021 and beyond. To that end, and as Scott will elaborate, we are accelerating our return of value capital allocation strategy given the conviction we have for our future performance.
Second quarter 2021 highlights include, Our global beverage businesses completing the start-up of 6 lines, including 3 in North America, 1 in EMEA and 2 in South America. Our global aluminum aerosol volumes increasing 20%, as I mentioned before. Our cups team executing national retail distribution of the Ball aluminum cup in all 50 states and providing 16-ounce, 20-ounce and 24-ounce aluminum cup to numerous sports and entertainment venues as COVID restrictions moderate. Our aerospace team winning new contracts to lift contracted backlog to a record $3 billion, following a significant win late in the quarter.
Our 2030 sustainability goals announcement, including ambitions to achieve net 0 carbon emissions, 90% global recycling rates, an 85% recycled content as well as establishing regional D&I goals and a vision of circularity for the aluminum beverage can. Our business is hiring nearly 1,600 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth and normal attrition due to retirements.
Our Board increased our quarterly dividend 33% and reiterated our 35 million share repurchase authorization, and we plan to purchase in excess of $500 million of stock this year while deploying $1.5 billion in EVA-accretive growth capital investments.
In summary, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level, standing up new greenfield plants, speeding up lines in existing facilities, bringing new aerospace infrastructure expansions online to support our increasing backlog and hiring amazing talent to join our team. To everyone listening, best wishes to you and your families for good health and continued safety.
And with that, I'll turn it over to our President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"

I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our team safe and vigilant.

Our global HR, environmental health and safety professionals and our own personal actions continue to keep our team safe and vigilant. The teams are doing a great job managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions and intermittent supply chain challenges.
We are entering the second half with a lot of momentum, a few manageable challenges and a visible path to strong performance throughout 2021 and beyond. Second quarter global beverage volume is up 13% versus 2020, and ongoing strength in EMEA and South America offset start-up costs in North America, retail marketing investments for our retail cup launch, the later-than-anticipated award timing for a new aerospace contract and higher year-over-year costs.
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level. We are on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity, and we recently announced global projects, all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary. Cans are in high demand, contracts are in place, and Ball is well positioned.
Our focus on speed to market, talent, training, systems and operational readiness is paying off as we continue to ramp up new capacity on time and on budget. To all the teams listening, our time is now, and you are making this happen. Keep up the great work.
As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,600 colleagues year-to-date, with the majority of them located in the United States. Our investment in talent, training and development and immersion into the Ball culture and EVA mindset is a vital part of near- and long-term success. We are blessed as an organization to attract this talent in the current environment and are committed to their success.
Can demand across all beverage categories remains strong. Our focus on improving customer experience by expanding can availability via new production coming online and providing our network latitude to build adequate inventory will continue to aid that trend.
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability. Following EMEA's lead in 2020, our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI Certification by year-end 2021. And each of our global businesses set specific regional D&I goals as part of our 2030 sustainability goals announcement.
Proof points of our progress include women representing over 40% of the new team in one of our Brazilian plant investments, and in aerospace, over 40% of our summer interns and new hires representing ethnic and gender diversity. We commend our global colleagues' commitment to our sustainability journey and also wish to recognize our supply chain's recent investments and sustainability-focused initiatives.
As we discussed throughout 2020, growth in our global beverage business is accelerating, and our product portfolio continues to support our customers' new brands as well as broaden the addressable market for aluminum cans, bottles and cups.
Given market characteristics and our project execution, I continue to be very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021. We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. Ball is well positioned to capture growth, given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets.
Looking out, contractual terms and conditions are favorable, and longstanding pass-through mechanisms are in place for aluminum and other items. And as we said on last quarter's earnings call, now we execute.
Now for a few brief comments on each region. In North America, beverage second quarter volumes were up 5% versus 2020 and up 6.4% versus 2019 during the quarter. Earnings were up slightly. And as expected, higher volume offset the combined effect of project start-up costs and operational efficiencies in plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory entering peak season.
Glendale and Pittston are both operational. And as of today, 3 lines are running in Glendale and Pittston's first-line is coming up its learning curve. Both plants will exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green ends manufacturing plant will start up early in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining half of the anticipated $50 million in start-up costs will flow through in the second half of 2021.
Across our broad customer base, beverage can demand is strong in all brand categories: alcohol, soft drinks, energy and water. Despite recent chatter on hard seltzers, nothing has changed about our plans. We expect favorable growth trends across all categories to continue, which will drive more EVA-enhancing opportunities, supported by long duration contracts with strategic customers and large regional accounts.
In the near term, the work to build adequate inventory levels will offset some of the benefit of having new capacity online during the third quarter and position the business for success. Looking out longer term, Ball will build another beverage can manufacturing plant in the Southeast. Our new North Carolina facility is supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate the facility to come online in late 2023 or 2024.
In EMEA, segment volume for the second quarter was up 18% versus 2020 on easier comps given prior year's volume declines due to COVID onset timing and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus second quarter 2019, volumes were up 9%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues.
We foresee European beverage can volumes up high single digits throughout second half of 2021 and beyond. Future growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and additional regional plant opportunities emerging to fulfill market demand in the biggest can markets across EMEA. Our new greenfield plants in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key accounts. Our EMEA team is executing very well and fully prepared for these exciting investments.
In South America, second quarter volumes were up 15% versus 2020 and up 16% versus 2019, given easier comps due to the prior year's COVID impact and despite cooler-than-normal seasonal temperatures and delivery channels in large cities limiting alcohol purchases. We continue to see more earnings upside in South America. As John mentioned, 2 new lines ramped up in existing facilities in South America during the quarter, and the Frutal, Brazil plant is preparing for a late third quarter start-up. Additional investments both in Brazil and throughout the region are also anticipated.
Similar to our prior commentary, we anticipate can growth in the mid-teens for the full year, and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online.
In summary, our global beverage team did a terrific job navigating some uncontrollables during the quarter while also executing as well as we can on the things we can control. Our aluminum aerosol team did an excellent job supplying growth across EMEA, resulting in 20% higher volumes in the second quarter globally versus 2020 and 12% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period.
The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. In addition, the business continues to amplify the sustainability credentials of our extruded aluminum bottles to deliver innovation across multiple brand and product categories, including the second quarter rollout of refillable, reclosable personal care packaging at a leading U.S. mass retailer.
Our cups team continues to raise awareness, establish distribution, execute initial sell-through and invest for continued growth in 2021 and beyond. In addition to the 50 states retail launch John mentioned, the team continued to invest in the Party Starts Here marketing campaign to engage and educate consumers about infinitely recyclable aluminum cups. We continue to expect our cups business to turn a profit starting in 2022.
Turning to aerospace. The team continued to win contracts, and year-to-date contracted backlog is up 25%. The aerospace business dealt with lingering effects of inefficient supply chains. Though exiting the quarter, we saw notable improvement with key subcontractors, and we are exciting -- excited to book a key contract win at the end of the quarter. This win and the trajectory of recent performance sets up the business for notable sales and earnings growth in the second half of 2021 and beyond in addition to margin improvement beyond 2021.  
At Ball aerospace, we are managing challenges, nurturing our culture while capturing the future. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done by not only the aerospace team but everyone across the organization.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Comparable second quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.86 versus $0.65 in 2020, an increase of 32%. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect strong global beverage results, slightly lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, offset by previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate costs as well as labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy with ample liquidity and flexibility.
As we sit here today, some additional key metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 17%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $95 million. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025.
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new growth projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash. As fellow owners, and in alignment with our EVA discipline, we will prudently balance real-time growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
Given the second quarter's strength and net leverage in our target range, we will return significant value to shareholders via dividends, as John mentioned earlier, and our ongoing 2021 share repurchase program of at least $500 million. In 2021, we'll return approximately $1 billion to shareholders, including dividends and buybacks, and we intend to double that total return to shareholders in 2022.  
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

We'll work safely together to execute on projects, support our customers' growth, drive the circular economy and generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and return even more value to our shareholders.

We've seen -- obviously, we participated in the growth of that space, but it is not -- the underpinnings for the things that we've been talking about in terms of long-term securitization of contracts, EVA accretion, it's not on the backs of that category specifically.
And so I think it will continue to grow. It's clearly not going to grow at the rate it has been. I think what's been clear in that space is the folks that continue to innovate and innovate effectively are the ones that are taking share. And so from that perspective, we're -- we believe that we have a right to play in the innovation space, and I think we benefit from those customers in particular. And so that's where our focus is.
I'm leery to comment on unit volumes across the entire space for the back half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense of how we at Ball kind of view that category. We're continuing to bet on the long-term trajectory of the can and can wins in every channel.

I think going back to 2019, when we had an Investor Day and we've laid out the growth trajectory, we've been pretty consistent that I believe it's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 2/3 alcohol, 1/3 other. It may be shifting a little bit more to 60% alcohol and 40%. And the reason for that is energy. The energy market continues to absolutely be on fire. And so that's the only fundamental change I see in like the underlying architecture.
The good news is that means volume is more than what we anticipated a couple of years ago. But that segment, in particular -- and there's more fitness energy drinks coming online. You're an end consumer, you see all of this, and we're obviously going to benefit from it."

At a high level, we are essentially running this business during peak season as a make to order instead of a make to stock business. And because of that, you see very different behaviors from end consumers in North America. So the volatility of what products win and what products win at a lesser degree, if you don't have safety stock available to lean into that, that manifests into more label changes and more conversions. And that's what our plants are up against right now.
We have known we've got some significant footprint investments coming online here. As I think both John and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, 3 lines came on in North America this quarter. They'll start to gain efficiency, and then we'll have built out in 2 facilities 8 lines by the end of this year. That will give us some much-needed breathing room.
And as those come online, and we can build to stock in the traditional December-January time periods, we will see the benefits in peak season next year in North America. And we're not done on expanding, obviously, to continue to make sure that we've got the appropriate asset utilization, and you'll see the efficiency levels pick up in our plants because they'll actually have a fighting chance to do what we're planning to do."

What we're planning on doing in the second half of this year is get them back to the mid-teens, call it, 15-plus or minus, because that's where we think more optimal levels can be.

And so their influence and maybe, more importantly, how the end consumer is consuming products through the smaller retail channels and the mini marts in that part of the world, they like cans a lot more than they like the historical returnable glass offerings.
And so we've seen a manifestation of -- to your point, if a new product is coming out, it's disproportionately coming out in cans. In Europe, that's the lowest can penetration market in terms of substrate penetration anywhere in the world for us outside of Mexico and much the same. I think there's ample growth in and away from plastic, from glass, from on-premise kegs through direct channels. So we're seeing that, we're seeing the can win.
I don't know that I could point to one particular category because I -- we're seeing it across every category. So there's a heavier lean in terms of cans. And the thing that emboldens us and continues to, sort of echo John's comments at the outset that we're right in line with our expectations. Nothing has changed.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com. 
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. 
The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations. 
Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our outlook for the company. 
Ball Corporation finished the quarter in a strong position despite challenging year-over-year comparable results from the economic recovery this time last year, continued supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures that are being experienced in the rest of the manufacturing world. 
For the quarter, we generated comparable operating earnings of $417 million, which is flat against prior year and up 13% from 2019, while generating comparable diluted earnings per share of $0.94, up 6% versus the prior year and 34% over 2019. Underlying demand for our products remains strong. 
Shipped volumes in the quarter were up 1% North and Central America, where we dealt with freight and supply disruptions while simultaneously deliberately building back our inventories. In EMEA, volumes were up 4%, driven by continued package mix shifts. And in South America, volumes were down mid-teens percent largely due to a difficult year-over-year comparable as South America ramped up significantly in the third quarter of 2020 after being largely shut down during the second quarter of 2020. 
As we look forward, we expect year-over-year growth to accelerate further with strong expectations in the fourth quarter and going forward. Dan will elaborate more in his comments, and we'll also focus on providing more detail by segment. 
During the third quarter, we began absorbing the impact of global supply chain hardship clauses being triggered by some of our suppliers for the first time in decades while also weathering the impact of indirect supply chain disruptions for certain materials, dunnage, freight transportation at our customer locations. Though we have existing mechanisms in our contracts to recoup certain costs and are confident in our ability to recoup such costs over time, at the moment, these mechanisms are not sufficient in the current environment. And as a result, we are implementing a comprehensive commercial cost recovery plan to cover unprecedented excessive costs outside of our normal customer engagements. Our commercial teams have begun discussions with our customers on a case-by-case basis, the need for such cost recovery efforts if we are to continue to invest alongside the growth of our customers and partners. 
In conjunction with our commercial cost recovery plan, we'll also leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses. Despite this, our 5-year growth and profitability outlook that we discussed a year ago at our Investor Day remains intact, and we are very excited about our trajectory going into 2020. 
Demand for our products and technologies continues to outstrip supply and our new facility start-ups are all on track or better relative to our plans, which will both lead to significant growth in long-term diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to our shareholders over the foreseeable future. 
Other third quarter 2021 highlights include our global beverage can business completing the start-up of 6 lines, including 4 in North America, 1 in EMEA and 1 in South America and announcing 2 additional greenfields in Nevada and North Carolina: our global aerosol -- aluminum aerosol volumes, up 15%; our cups team signing new contracts with the world's largest retailer in a major food service distribution and hospitality partner; our aerospace team opening its state-of-the-art payload development facility in Broomfield, Colorado, expanding our aerospace manufacturing center in Westminster, Colorado as well as successfully launching the Ball bill OLI land imaging instrument on NASA's Lancet satellite. 
Our North American South America aluminum packaging business is continuing progress on the respective aluminum stewardship initiative certifications following EMEA's ASI certification last year. Our business has hired over 2,000 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth. We successfully raised $850 million in a 10-year bond offering at [ 3 1/8% ]. Our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 and electing Dr. [indiscernible] to our Board, who will bring a wealth of experience and knowledge as we proactively position our products to be the most sustainable in their respective categories. And in 2021, continuing to be on track to return $1 billion to shareholders while deploying in excess of $1.5 billion in EVA-accretive growth capital investments while generating earnings per share growth over time of at least 10% to 15%. 
In summary, despite near-term headwinds, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level and ready to take our performance to the next level. 
To all of our global employees, customers and suppliers, thank you for your hard work, for staying safe and for navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. Collectively, we are working to regain efficiencies, recover costs and deliver long-term value to stakeholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"

I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We strive to keep our teams safe. And to everyone listening, we strongly encourage vaccination and boosters. As John mentioned, the global operations, commercial and procurement",1400,"Thanks, John. I echo your thanks to our employees, customers and suppliers. We strive to keep our teams safe. And to everyone listening, we strongly encourage vaccination and boosters. 
As John mentioned, the global operations, commercial and procurement teams are managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions, while navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. These impacts are largely outside of Ball's control and includes steep supplier cost pass-throughs beyond normal levels. 
Ultimately, the compounding effect of labor and trucking shortages outside of Ball had impacted our operational efficiencies, customers' production and filling operations as well as retailers efficiency stocking store shelves, the degree of which varies greatly by region. Given the scale of cost being passed on to us and as John mentioned earlier, we are beginning conversations towards implementing the additional commercial cost recovery program. 
Our aerospace and aluminum packaging businesses delivered a tremendous amount of value amid current conditions. Third quarter single-digit volume growth in North America and EMEA aluminum beverage packaging was offset by double-digit volume declines in South America due to tough year-over-year comps of 30% growth in third quarter 2020 largely due to the timing effects of COVID in South America versus third quarter 2019 demand. 
Our retail marketing investments in cups continues and supports additional food service launches at stadiums and venues continues across the U.S. The Ball aluminum cup will begin an initial rollout at a major retailer during the fourth quarter and a new contract with a leading global food service and hospitality company that will further broaden the cups' presence at stadiums and venues. 
Our aerospace team brought online new infrastructure investments on time and on budget and supported the successful launch of OLI net spacecraft, complementing our legacy of value-added Earth imaging science. 
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. We remain on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity. We also recently announced additional domestic projects, all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary. 
To all the teams listening, I know it's been challenging to keep up with the growth, keep your heads held high and focus on basic blocking and tackling. We have the contracts, we have the raw materials, we have the equipment and we have each other. 
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability and driving our D&I goals. Our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI certification by year-end 2021. We launched Brazil's first Circular Economy Lab in October, and we continue to finalize our steps to achieve to become carbon neutral prior to 2050 after publicly stating our intent to achieve such goal. 
As we discussed throughout 2021, growth isn't always linear. Given our year-to-date global beverage shipment growth of 7% and recent supply chain dynamics, we are on course to achieve high single-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% for full year 2021. We continue to see annual growth rates in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future. 
Ball is well positioned to capture growth given our timely execution on new capacity additions and our established scale and innovation in the world's largest can regions. 
Now a few brief comments on each region. In North America beverage, third quarter ship volumes were up 1% versus 2020 and up 7.4% versus 2019. During the quarter, earnings were down as volume growth was offset by the combined effect of inflationary cost increases from suppliers above current cost recovery provisions, project start-up costs and operational inefficiencies in legacy plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory and indirect supply chain disruptions. 
Glendale and Pittston successfully started up additional lines during the quarter. Both plants will exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green manufacturing plant started up successfully in early October. 
In the near term, the work to build adequate inventory levels is ongoing. These actions and cost recovery will further position the business for success in 2022. Following the successful on-time start-ups of Glendale, Pittston and Bowling Green, Ball has announced 2 new greenfield plants in Nevada and North Carolina. Both are supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate these facilities coming online in late 2022 and '24, respectively. 
Lastly, I would be remiss not to acknowledge and thank Colin Gillis who is retiring from Ball, for his 48 years of dedication to the company and our industry. We wish him well. 
Kathleen Pitre, who many of you know, was our Chief Commercial and Sustainability Officer in our global beverage business, will do a great job in leading this business in the future. 
In EMEA, segment ship volume for the third quarter was up 4% versus 2020 on tougher comps, given prior year's volume increases due to COVID reopening timing and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus third quarter 2019, volumes were up 10.7%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. Year-to-date, our can volumes in EMEA are up 9%. 
Ongoing high single-digit growth will be driven by new and existing categories due to cans and our new greenfield plants in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic, which are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key partners. Our EMEA team is executing very well and managing complex country-by-country supply chain issues. In South America, third quarter volumes were down upper teens percent versus 2020 and up high single digits percent versus 2019. 
2020 volumes were up 30% versus third quarter 2019 due to timing effects related to COVID. Cooler-than-normal seasonal temperatures in the first 2 months of the third quarter this year and weather damage sustained to our Extrema facility contributed to lower year-over-year volumes. With unseasonably cold temperatures and the facility disruption largely behind us, October volumes recovered and were up 5%. 
We continue to see more earnings upside in South America in 2022 and beyond. The Frutal, Brazil plant started up its first line earlier this month and anticipate starting up its second line in early 2022. Additional investments throughout the region are also on schedule. 
As we enter the busy summer selling season and given the nice volume bounce back in October, we anticipate double-digit can growth for the full year, and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online. 
In summary, our global beverage team is preparing for long-term durable growth while managing volatility and costs across our supply chain. No doubt money was left on the table. We are laser focused on operating safely, controlling the things we can control, recovering cost and delivering high-quality cans to our customers from new and existing facilities supported by equitable contracts. 
Our aluminum aerosol team did a good job supplying growth across EMEA, Mexico and Brazil, resulting in 15% higher volumes in the third quarter globally versus 2020 and 5% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period. The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. 
In addition, the business continues to expand the rollout of refillable, reclosable aluminum personal care and bottle packaging across multiple categories. To support the new cups contracts I mentioned earlier, we have increased marketing investments and are adding another cup manufacturing line in our Rome, Georgia cups plant. Following this investment, both lines will be capable of making multiple cup sizes. 
Turning to profitability. We anticipate 2021 total investment cost in the cup business will be in the range of $45 million, and we expect the business turning a profit in 2022. 
Turning to Aerospace. The team continued to win contracts and maintain record backlog. The operating earnings were up in the quarter and included the impact of rate adjustments on fixed-price contracts. This business continues to be positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2021 and margin improvement beyond 2021, given contract mix. 
Across all of our operations, we are actively investing in the businesses to deliver on strong demand and grow and train our labor base while also effectively managing supply chain disruptions, recovering costs, achieving returns on capital employed nurturing our culture and delivering shareholder value. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done across the organization. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Scott."

Comparable year-to-date 2021 diluted earnings per share up 17%. Third quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher sales volumes and improved mix. Comparable third quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in EMEA, South America, aerospace and aluminum aerosol and a lower effective tax rate related to higher R&D tax credits, offset by lower North American beverage operating earnings, previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate labor and start-up costs support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy and with ample liquidity and flexibility. 
During the quarter, we completed a successful $850 million bond offering at [ 3 and 8% ]. Proceeds will support general corporate purposes. And in late October, we used the proceeds to redeem the bonds that were due in March of 2022. In addition, we completed the purchase of group annuity contracts and lump sum payments for certain U.S. pension benefit obligations. Assets totaling $325 million were transferred to an insurance company during the quarter. The purchases triggered noncash settlement losses of $130 million recorded in business consolidation and other activities. Year-to-date, Ball has contributed approximately $200 million to its remaining pension plans. 
As we sit here today, some key additional metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 15%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $80 million to reflect lower benefits. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new project -- new growth capital projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. While continues to be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners and through the lens of EVA discipline, we will prudently balance growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. 
As John mentioned earlier, we'll return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021, and we intend to double that total return in 2022. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

While we and the rest of the manufacturing world base inflation and supply chain headwinds in the near term that are reminiscent of the 1970s, we are confident that we will get through it. You've heard from us that the sustainable growth trajectory of our business continues. And as we sit here today, we continue to believe we are on the front end of a decade shift that will favor our packages. The key to our success is to just be Ball, be close to our customers, focus on attention to detail and act like true owners of the business.

I think about sort of compounds, inks, chemicals, epoxies, that world. Traditionally, the pass-through mechanisms largely, as John indicated, at least for the last 20, 30 years, sort of mirror our commercial contracts. But when those chemicals get outside kind of a compounding inflationary rate, it differs for each compound, but let's say, in excess of 10% just for purposes of this discussion. They have the ability to pass those through in shorter time intervals than on an annual basis. So we've been absorbing that. And that's largely what we're experiencing. 
From a plastic standpoint, maybe I'll let John handle that and then maybe I can give some color on the specific conversations we're having with customers on the branding side."

Full stop. We recognize that many of our customers have deep profit pools that are filled with plastic, and we don't anticipate that they're going to do a wholesale shift from aluminum -- from plastic to aluminum. But let me just -- I'll pick on Europe right now. 
In 2019, the total package share of cans was 27%. 2021, it's 31%. That's a 4 percentage point change. CSD went from 16% can penetration to 19% in 2021. Beer went from 35% to 37%. Energy went from 69% to 76%. That's just in Europe. The same thing is going on here in North America. 
And so if you really want to talk about the circularity and the circular economy, plastic is not the solution to that. We recognize that there are certain instances where plastic may make more sense. But in a wholesale way, the train is already leaving, and that's why we said that we really do believe this is that the shift, and you're going to see more and more going into this. 
You see in the existing infrastructure bill, there is discussion about infrastructure investments in the recycling side. You talk about plastic taxes that are on current bills on the floor right now. This is not leaving this whole extended producer responsibility is going to become more and more important. Even in this quarter alone, Maine introduced an extended producer responsibility for responsibility law or plastic because they recognize that it's polluting the planet. This is only going to accelerate, and we have a solution."

So we have sufficient safety stock to eliminate that variability, that's the key thing we're focused on in 2022."

It surprised us to the upside as well. I think we entered the year thinking maybe more in the 10 billion to 12 billion range and that speaks to the strength of aluminum and maybe lends itself to your next question. 
But as we sit here today, we're putting a ton of capacity online. Our competitors are putting capacity online. And early insights into 2022 is we're significantly oversold again. And so I think there will be some need for importation again. we will be importing as well. We may be importing in other regions because the growth is so significant in some of the other regions. 
So yes, as we get a clearer picture, we'll indicate kind of what we think that is, but this is early stages of our planning period for 2022. And it's clear that our customers don't want to be paying that much in freight. So if we can domicile that, and it's just going to be a matter of how fast we can domesticate that volume. But there will certainly be need probably for 2022, and I would assume 2023 for some importations at some level. 
And Mark, your point about the growth, you're absolutely right. It does reinforce the need for recycling. And a couple of things. I just -- I'll remind people that while the recycling rate in the United States is the lowest in the world, it's still 8 to 10x if any other substrate in any meaningful way. So it's important to note that and 70-plus percent of all the aluminum in a can is recycled content currently. I think the recycling is a very complicated issue, but there's 3 things. You got to focus on the infrastructure, you got to focus on the collection and then you got to focus on the producer responsibility. 
With the infrastructure in the existing bills that are being bandied about in Washington, D.C. today, there are money set aside to help the local municipalities, reinvest and on the infrastructure of recycling. And so we're very hopeful that, that will get through because that will provide the necessary means for these municipalities that have to focus on health care and schools and roads and sewers and everything else, provide them the necessary means to recapitalize the recycling infrastructure that hasn't been recapitalized since the 1960s. 
Then it gets to the collection side. And we can have debates about curbside collection versus deposits. But if you get the infrastructure in place, then you got to get the collection, and we do a very poor job across the United States in collection. And at the same time, then it gets to who's going to pay for all this? Well, then it gets to extended producer responsibility. And if there's no economic value in a recycling stream of certain substrates then they are a free rider and they ought to be paying for it. 
Those are the discussions we're having with our state and federal legislators about the recycling infrastructure, the collection and the producer responsibility. And so this is not a short-term game. It's a long-term game. I wish it would move faster but it is what it is, but we are putting our shoulder into this to make sure that people understand the value of aluminum in a recycling stream. 
Okay. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for your participation. Dina, thank you for hosting us, and we look forward to engaging with you over the next quarter. Take care."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.  
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the notes section of today's earnings release. The release also includes a table summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.  
Now joining me on the call today are Dan Fisher, our President; and Scott Morrison, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide some introductory remarks. Dan will discuss packaging and aerospace performance and trends, Scott will discuss key financial metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our outlook for the company.  
Ball Corporation finished the quarter on a strong position despite challenging year-over-year comparable results from the economic recovery this time last year, continued supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures that are being experienced in the rest of the manufacturing world.  
For the quarter, we generated comparable operating earnings of $417 million, which is flat against prior year and up 13% from 2019, while generating comparable diluted earnings per share of $0.94, up 6% versus the prior year and 34% over 2019. Underlying demand for our products remains strong. Shipped volumes in the quarter were up 1% North and Central America, where we dealt with freight and supply disruptions while simultaneously deliberately building back our inventories. In EMEA, volumes were up 4%, driven by continued package mix shifts. And in South America, volumes were down mid-teens percent, largely due to a difficult year-over-year comparable as South America ramped up significantly in the third quarter of 2020 after being largely shut down during the second quarter of 2020.  
As we look forward, we expect year-over-year growth to accelerate further with strong expectations in the fourth quarter and going forward. Dan will elaborate more in his comments, and we'll also focus on providing more detail by segment.  
During the third quarter, we began absorbing the impact of global supply chain hardship clauses being triggered by some of our suppliers for the first time in decades while also weathering the impact of indirect supply chain disruptions for certain materials, dunnage, freight and transportation at our customer locations. Though we have existing mechanisms in our contracts to recoup certain costs and are confident in our ability to recoup such costs over time, at the moment, these mechanisms are not sufficient in the current environment. And as a result, we are implementing a comprehensive commercial cost recovery plan to cover unprecedented excessive costs outside of our normal customer engagements. Our commercial teams have begun discussions with our customers on a case-by-case basis, the need for such cost recovery efforts, if we are to continue to invest alongside the growth of our customers and partners.  
In conjunction with our commercial cost recovery plan, we'll also leverage existing contractual terms and conditions to recoup higher input costs in future periods in both our packaging and aerospace businesses. Despite this, our 5-year growth and profitability outlook that we discussed a year ago at our Investor Day remains intact, and we are very excited about our trajectory going into 2020.  
Demand for our products and technologies continues to outstrip supply and our new facility start-ups are all on track or better relative to our plans, which will both lead to significant growth in long-term diluted earnings per share, EVA dollars, cash from operations and return of value to our shareholders over the foreseeable future.  
Other third quarter 2021 highlights include our global beverage can business completing the start-up of 6 lines, including 4 in North America, 1 in EMEA and 1 in South America and announcing 2 additional greenfields in Nevada and North Carolina; our global aerosol -- aluminum aerosol volumes up 15%; our cups team signing new contracts with the world's largest retailer in a major food service distribution and hospitality partner; our aerospace team opening its state-of-the-art payload development facility in Broomfield, Colorado, expanding our aerospace manufacturing center in Westminster, Colorado as well as successfully launching the Ball-built OLI land imaging instrument on NASA's Landsat 9 satellite.  
Our North America and South America aluminum packaging business is continuing progress on the respective aluminum stewardship initiative certifications following EMEA's ASI certification last year. Our business has hired over 2,000 people net year-to-date to support our long-term growth. We successfully raised $850 million in a 10-year bond offering at 3.125%; our Board declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.20 and electing Dr. Dune Ives to our Board, who will bring a wealth of experience and knowledge as we proactively position our products to be the most sustainable in their respective categories; and in 2021, continuing to be on track to return $1 billion to shareholders while deploying in excess of $1.5 billion in EVA-accretive growth capital investments while generating earnings per share growth over time of at least 10% to 15%.  
In summary, despite near-term headwinds, Ball continues to operate from a position of strength. Our team is executing at a high level and ready to take our performance to the next level.  
To all of our global employees, customers and suppliers, thank you for your hard work, for staying safe and for navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. Collectively, we are working to regain efficiencies, recover costs and deliver long-term value to stakeholders.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to our President, Dan Fisher. Dan?"

And to everyone listening, we strongly encourage vaccination and boosters.  
As John mentioned, the global operations, commercial and procurement teams are managing accelerated growth, large-scale capacity additions, while navigating unprecedented supply chain disruptions. These impacts are largely outside of Ball's control and includes steep supplier cost pass-throughs beyond normal levels.  
Ultimately, the compounding effect of labor and trucking shortages outside of Ball had impacted our operational efficiencies, customers' production and filling operations as well as retailers' efficiency stocking store shelves, the degree of which varies greatly by region. Given the scale of cost being passed on to us and, as John mentioned earlier, we are beginning conversations towards implementing the additional commercial cost recovery program.  
Our aerospace and aluminum packaging businesses delivered a tremendous amount of value amid current conditions. Third quarter single-digit volume growth in North America and EMEA aluminum beverage packaging was offset by double-digit volume declines in South America due to tough year-over-year comps of 30% growth in third quarter 2020, largely due to the timing effects of COVID in South America versus third quarter 2019 demand.  
Our retail marketing investments in cups continues, and supports additional food service launches at stadiums and venues continues across the U.S. The Ball aluminum cup will begin an initial rollout at a major retailer during the fourth quarter and a new contract with a leading global food service and hospitality company that will further broaden the cups' presence at stadiums and venues.  
Our aerospace team brought online new infrastructure investments on time and on budget and supported the successful launch of OLI aboard the Landsat 9 spacecraft, complementing our legacy of value-added Earth imaging science.  
Demand for aluminum beverage cans continues to outstrip supply around the globe. We remain on track to exit 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity. We also recently announced additional domestic projects, all of which underscore our Investor Day commentary.  
To all the teams listening, I know it's been challenging to keep up with the growth, keep your heads held high and focus on basic blocking and tackling. We have the contracts, we have the raw materials, we have the equipment and we have each other.  
We also continue to make significant progress in operationalizing and commercializing sustainability and driving our D&I goals. Our operations in South America and North America are on track to achieve ASI certification by year-end 2021. We launched Brazil's first Circular Economy Lab in October, and we continue to finalize our steps to achieve to become carbon neutral prior to 2050 after publicly stating our intent to achieve such goal.  
As we discussed throughout 2021, growth isn't always linear. Given our year-to-date global beverage shipment growth of 7% and recent supply chain dynamics, we are on course to achieve high single-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% for full year 2021. We continue to see annual growth rates in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future.  
Ball is well positioned to capture growth given our timely execution on new capacity additions and our established scale and innovation in the world's largest can regions.  
Now a few brief comments on each region. In North America beverage, third quarter ship volumes were up 1% versus 2020 and up 7.4% versus 2019. During the quarter, earnings were down as volume growth was offset by the combined effect of inflationary cost increases from suppliers above current cost recovery provisions, project start-up costs and operational inefficiencies in legacy plants brought about by unsustainably low inventory and indirect supply chain disruptions.  
Glendale and Pittston successfully started up additional lines during the quarter. Both plants will exit 2021 with 4 can manufacturing lines installed, and our Bowling Green manufacturing plant started up successfully in early October.  
In the near term, the work to build adequate inventory levels is ongoing. These actions and cost recovery will further position the business for success in 2022. Following the successful on-time start-ups of Glendale, Pittston and Bowling Green, Ball has announced 2 new greenfield plants in Nevada and North Carolina. Both are supported by long duration contracts with strategic global customers. We are excited to invest alongside our customers and anticipate these facilities coming online in late 2022 and '24, respectively.  
Lastly, I would be remiss not to acknowledge and thank Colin Gillis who is retiring from Ball, for his 48 years of dedication to the company and our industry. We wish him well. Kathleen Pitre, who many of you know was our Chief Commercial and Sustainability Officer in our global beverage business, will do a great job in leading this business in the future.  
In EMEA, segment ship volume for the third quarter was up 4% versus 2020 on tougher comps given prior year's volume increases due to COVID reopening timing and were also up due to customers adding new can filling investments. Versus third quarter 2019, volumes were up 10.7%. Across Ball's EMEA business, demand trends and positive momentum continues. Year-to-date, our can volumes in EMEA are up 9%.  
Ongoing high single-digit growth will be driven by new and existing categories utilizing cans and our new greenfield plants in the U.K., Russia and Czech Republic, which are supported by long duration contracts for committed volumes with global and regional key partners. Our EMEA team is executing very well and managing complex country-by-country supply chain issues. In South America, third quarter volumes were down upper teens percent versus 2020 and up high single digits percent versus 2019.  
2020 volumes were up 30% versus third quarter 2019 due to timing effects related to COVID. Cooler-than-normal seasonal temperatures in the first 2 months of the third quarter this year and weather damage sustained to our Extrema facility contributed to lower year-over-year volumes. With unseasonably cold temperatures and the facility disruption largely behind us, October volumes recovered and were up 5%. 
We continue to see more earnings upside in South America in 2022 and beyond. The Frutal, Brazil plant started up its first line earlier this month and anticipate starting up its second line in early 2022. Additional investments throughout the region are also on schedule. 
As we enter the busy summer selling season and given the nice volume bounce back in October, we anticipate double-digit can growth for the full year, and additional growth will be possible once we have more capacity online. 
In summary, our global beverage team is preparing for long-term durable growth while managing volatility and costs across our supply chain. No doubt money was left on the table. We are laser focused on operating safely, controlling the things we can control, recovering cost and delivering high-quality cans to our customers from new and existing facilities supported by equitable contracts. 
Our aluminum aerosol team did a good job supplying growth across EMEA, Mexico and Brazil, resulting in 15% higher volumes in the third quarter globally versus 2020 and 5% higher volume versus 2019 for the same period. The team continues to manage varying degrees of reopening status in Brazil and India. 
In addition, the business continues to expand the rollout of refillable, reclosable aluminum personal care and bottle packaging across multiple categories. To support the new cups contracts I mentioned earlier, we have increased marketing investments and are adding another cup manufacturing line in our Rome, Georgia cups plant. Following this investment, both lines will be capable of making multiple cup sizes. 
Turning to profitability. We anticipate 2021 total investment cost in the cup business will be in the range of $45 million, and we expect the business turning a profit in 2022. 
Turning to Aerospace. The team continued to win contracts and maintain record backlog. The operating earnings were up in the quarter and included the impact of rate adjustments on fixed-price contracts. This business continues to be positioned for sales and earnings growth in 2021 and margin improvement beyond 2021 given contract mix. 
Across all of our operations, we are actively investing in the businesses to deliver on strong demand and grow and train our labor base while also effectively managing supply chain disruptions, recovering costs, achieving returns on capital employed, nurturing our culture and delivering shareholder value. We appreciate all of the amazing work being done across the organization. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

Comparable year-to-date 2021 diluted earnings per share up 17%. Third quarter sales were up due to the pass-through of higher aluminum prices, higher sales volumes and improved mix. Comparable third quarter diluted earnings per share reflects strong results in EMEA, South America, aerospace and aluminum aerosol and a lower effective tax rate related to higher R&D tax credits, offset by lower North American beverage operating earnings, previously discussed higher year-over-year corporate, labor and start-up costs to support business growth and marketing costs to drive the aluminum cup launch. Ball's balance sheet is very healthy and with ample liquidity and flexibility. 
During the quarter, we completed a successful $850 million bond offering at 3 1/8%. Proceeds will support general corporate purposes. And in late October, we used the proceeds to redeem the bonds that were due in March of 2022. In addition, we completed the purchase of group annuity contracts and lump sum payments for certain U.S. pension benefit obligations. Assets totaling $325 million were transferred to an insurance company during the quarter. The purchases triggered noncash settlement losses of $130 million recorded in business consolidation and other activities. Year-to-date, Ball has contributed approximately $200 million to its remaining pension plans. 
As we sit here today, some key additional metrics to keep in mind for 2021. Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 15%. Full year interest expense will be in the range of $270 million, and full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $80 million to reflect lower benefit accruals. We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025. 
Our 2021 cash from operations will grow in line with the earnings trajectory and be aided by a source in working capital. We expect 2021 total CapEx to exceed $1.5 billion, and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will flow through as new project -- new growth capital projects become operational later in the year and in the years to come. Ball continues to be good stewards of our cash as fellow owners and through the lens of EVA discipline, we will prudently balance growth opportunities with consistent return of value to our shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As John mentioned earlier, we'll return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021, and we intend to double that total return in 2022. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

We know who we are, we know where we're going and we know what's important. Following our strong year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are positioned to exceed our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15% and achieve our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond. 
While we and the rest of the manufacturing world face inflation and supply chain headwinds in the near term that are reminiscent of the 1970s, we are confident that we will get through it. You've heard from us that the sustainable growth trajectory of our business continues. And as we sit here today, we continue to believe we are on the front end of a decadal shift that will favor our packages. The key to our success is to just be Ball, be close to our customers, focus on attention to detail and act like true owners of the business. If we do this, we will generate significant earnings, cash, EVA and return even more value to our shareholders, all while helping to make our world more sustainable. 
In preparation for 2022, we intend to host our biennial Investor Day activities on September 21 and 22 in Colorado, and thank you for investing in Ball. 
And with that, Dina, we're ready for questions."

And so I'll let -- I'll turn it over to Scott in a minute, and he can talk about numbers. 
But -- and every customer is different. I would try and probably bucket it in 3 different ways. We have -- number one, we have some longer-term contracts where we have PPI and other provisions, but it's a lag. And so we're in discussions with our partners about investing in the future as part of that because we need to be recovering those if we're going to be able to invest going forward. The others, we have some contracts coming up, and we've already baked that in and priced that into those discussions that we've been having. And then we have some open contracts that we will be pricing it in. 
Every customer is a bit different, but this is -- we need to make sure that we are adequately capturing during all the costs in a timely way because we do believe, over time, we would get it. And if the hardship clauses and other things begin to abate, we're happy to talk to other customers about making sure that they participate in that as well.

They have the ability to pass those through in shorter time intervals than on an annual basis. So we've been absorbing that. And that's largely what we're experiencing.

Full stop. We recognize that many of our customers have deep profit pools that are filled with plastic, and we don't anticipate that they're going to do a wholesale shift from aluminum -- from plastic to aluminum. But let me just -- I'll pick on Europe right now. 
In 2019, the total package share of cans was 27%. 2021, it's 31%. That's a 4 percentage point change. CSD went from 16% can penetration to 19% in 2021. Beer went from 35% to 37%. Energy went from 69% to 76%. That's just in Europe. The same thing is going on here in North America. 
And so if you really want to talk about the circularity and the circular economy, plastic is not the solution to that. We recognize that there are certain instances where plastic may make more sense. But in a wholesale way, the train is already leaving, and that's why we said that we really do believe this is a decadal shift, and you're going to see more and more going into this. 
You see in the existing infrastructure bill, there is discussion about infrastructure investments in the recycling side. You talk about plastic taxes that are on current bills on the floor right now. This is not leaving, this whole extended producer responsibility is going to become more and more important. Even in this quarter alone, Maine introduced an extended producer responsibility for responsibility law for plastic because they recognize that it's polluting the planet.

And so we've got no shortage of opportunity. I would also say, as the retail providers begin to stabilize their supply chain, they want innovation, and our customers want to push out innovation. And a more stable supply chain ecosystem is going to provide a lot of opportunities that candidly our customers and us have been sitting on for the last 12 to 18 months. So no, hard seltzer is not going to impact our current plans or our future plans."

I think there was a short-term dislocation, and it's happening everywhere. And I can tell you, we've probably had a couple of hundred retirements that we knew were going to come within the next 5 years, but it's happened because folks are exhausted of COVID. And so we saw that. 
We have been hiring for the last 3 years 1,000 folks a year. We'll continue to hire 1,000 folks next year. And so the balance of retirement versus attrition and what that net number can have an impact on the rate. But I think the team understands this. I think this is a spot anomaly just to be fully transparent. We're seeing it in other parts of the business. And I think as the world starts to reset and get back to normal, you'll see less and less of that. 
So I think we had an intermittent hit here in the last 6 months largely due to COVID because of unanticipated retirement. But the team has done a remarkable job recruiting. And I think what we're finding is Denver and the excitement about being part of Ball and some of the projects we're working on is a hell of a talent magnet."

On top of which, you have absorbed a lot of start-up costs this year as you significantly added capacity across the network. Historically, kind of we thought from a volume leverage perspective, kind of profit growth for Ball can be nearly 2x volume growth. Over time, clearly -- this year is maybe not quite living up to that or there's real headwinds to that kind of operating leverage. Do you think you can make sufficient progress on those contracts with your customers in this environment, to be back in that kind of operating leverage range next year?"

But as we sit here today, we're putting a ton of capacity online. Our competitors are putting capacity online. And early insights into 2022 is we're significantly oversold again. And so I think there will be some need for importation again. We will be importing as well. We may be importing in other regions because the growth is so significant in some of the other regions. 
So yes, as we get a clearer picture, we'll indicate kind of what we think that is, but this is early stages of our planning period for 2022. And it's clear that our customers don't want to be paying that much in freight. So if we can domicile that, it's just going to be a matter of how fast we can domesticate that volume. But there will certainly be need probably for 2022 and I would assume 2023 for some importations at some level."

It does reinforce the need for recycling. And a couple of things. I just -- I'll remind people that while the recycling rate in the United States is the lowest in the world, it's still 8 to 10x of any other substrate in any meaningful way. So it's important to note that and 70-plus percent of all the aluminum in a can is recycled content currently. 
I think the recycling is a very complicated issue, but there's 3 things. You got to focus on the infrastructure, you got to focus on the collection and then you got to focus on the producer responsibility. 
With the infrastructure in the existing bills that are being [ branded ] about in Washington, D.C. today, there are money set aside to help the local municipalities reinvest on the infrastructure of recycling. And so we're very hopeful that, that will get through because that will provide the necessary means for these municipalities that have to focus on health care and schools and roads and sewers and everything else, provide them the necessary means to recapitalize the recycling infrastructure that hasn't been recapitalized since the 1960s. 
Then it gets to the collection side. And we can have debates about curbside collection versus deposits. But if you get the infrastructure in place, then you got to get the collection. And we do a very poor job across the United States in collection. And at the same time, then it gets to who's going to pay for all this. Well, then it gets to extended producer responsibility. And if there's no economic value in a recycling stream of certain substrates, then they are a free rider and they ought to be paying for it. 
Those are the discussions we're having with our state and federal legislators about the recycling infrastructure, the collection and the producer responsibility. And so this is not a short-term game. It's a long-term game. I wish it would move faster, but it is what it is. But we are putting our shoulder into this to make sure that people understand the value of aluminum in a recycling stream."
