With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production",1433,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year of extreme volatility for our industry and the world. With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production at our fourth quarter 2020 rate. 
We entered 2021 with an improved financial position by taking the necessary steps to protect our asset base and derisk our balance sheet. I'm particularly proud of our teams who leveraged our technical expertise to mitigate production decline while relentlessly lowering costs. The capability of our outstanding employees to consistently deliver remarkable results safely was key to our ability to navigate the challenges of the last year as well as the challenges presented by the winter storm last week. 
This morning, we'll provide the details of our full year 2021 plan. This plan maintains our best-in-class capital intensity, even with the modest activity increase we started in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also provide an update on our divestiture and deleveraging progress as well as reviewing our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. 
Throughout 2020, we focused on maintaining the integrity of our production and asset base as well as lowering overhead and operating costs. Our achievements have positioned us to build on our track record of operational excellence and efficiency gains as we stabilize production in 2021. In the fourth quarter, our businesses continued to outperform and generate momentum for a strong start to this year. We exceeded our production guidance while continuing to deliver lower-than-expected operating costs for the quarter. Our oil and gas operating cost of $6.80 per BOE and domestic operating costs of $6.05 per BOE continue to demonstrate the lasting impact of our cost reduction measures as our domestic operating costs were significantly below our original expectations for the year. 
Although our activity slowed in the second and third quarters, our teams did not miss a step as we normalized activity in the fourth quarter. Our onshore domestic assets went from running 22 drilling rigs in the first quarter, down to 0 in the second quarter and then returning to 11 rigs by the end of the year. Operationally, we continue to outperform our expectations and deliver efficiency improvements with new drilling and completion records. Our Texas Delaware and DJ Basin teams demonstrated our consistent drive for efficiency by exceeding our original real cause synergy targets in the quarter, an achievement we're very proud of. 
No matter how favorable or challenging the environment in which we operate, we never take our eye off safety. Many of our teams tied or set new safety records last year, while our company-wide performance was our best ever as we simultaneously work to minimize the risk from COVID. 
We transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position, having achieved our divestiture target for 2020. We closed approximately $2.8 billion of asset sales, $2.4 billion of which closed in the fourth quarter. In 2020, we utilized the divestiture proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt and liabilities by approximately $2.4 billion and $300 million, respectively. 
We also completed a successful refinancing program, extending approximately $7 billion of debt maturities. Together, these achievements place us in a strong position for the year ahead, so we can focus on reducing debt and improving our business while maximizing the value of our unmatched asset base. 
The progress we made last year in reducing operating costs will continue into 2021 as the synergies we delivered and the vast majority of our additional cost savings remain in place. These savings are now embedded in our ongoing operations. We expect to deliver overhead of $1.8 billion, which represents full retention of all synergies and a significant portion of our additional cost reductions. We'll continuously seek new opportunities to lower costs and expand margins as we move forward. We expect to spend $2.9 billion of capital in 2021 to sustain our production at our fourth quarter production rate. 
Our plans are based on a $40 WTI price environment, and we are prepared to flex spending lower, if necessary. If oil prices continue to improve this year, we will not increase capital in support of production growth. The flexibility and optionality that our scale and asset base provide are often underappreciated. We are equipped to adjust to future potential commodity price dips or regulatory changes while being positioned to leverage the benefits of future price uplift. Likewise, our capital and spending plans retain a high degree of flexibility, allowing us to adapt to a changing macro environment. 
The level of capital spending required in 2021 to sustain our production demonstrates our ability to deliver best-in-class capital intensity even in a period where we are not growing production. Leveraging our technical expertise, particularly in subsurface characterization, enables us to drill the best wells while we continue to pursue new ways to lower costs with the goal of spending less to produce more barrels. The efficiency of our capital development, coupled with our low base decline and our relentless pursuit of maximizing every barrel from our existing wells, allows us to hold our production flat with capital of $2.9 billion in 2021. 
We are pleased with the progress achieved to date in closing divestitures and reducing debt, especially given the challenging market in 2020. We exceeded our $2 billion divestiture target with the closing of the mineral and surface acreage in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah as well as our onshore assets in Colombia. Post Colombia, we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of asset sales to be announced by mid-2021. We are making progress towards this new target and have already closed approximately $350 million of transactions. 
As we near the end of our large-scale divestiture program, we will continue to balance transaction timing with price realization. We'll not sacrifice value to close transactions quickly. As commodity prices continue to strengthen, we expect the value that buyers place on assets to adjust accordingly. We will always prioritize obtaining value for our shareholders over meeting a deadline or divestiture target, which we've imposed upon ourselves. 
As Rob will speak to you in a moment, our debt reduction efforts, combined with our ability to refinance $7 billion of near-term maturities over the last year, places us in a favorable position. We continuously review our portfolio to ensure we have the optimal mix of free cash flow generation, capital efficiency and low decline assets. We now have one of the best portfolios in Oxy's 100-year history, but this doesn't mean that we have stopped looking for opportunities to improve our asset base. We frequently complete acreage trades to core up positions and operatorship, and on occasion, may pursue opportunities where we see outstanding value with the bolt-on acquisition. For example, we recently exercised a preferential right to increase our working interest in the Lucius project, which we operate in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect that our investment will pay back in slightly over a year in a $40 oil price environment. 
Our oil and gas highlights slides includes just a few of the many achievements our business delivered in the fourth quarter. Even during a period of increasing activity, we continue to improve uptime and reduce time to market by lowering drilling and completion times. This includes our Gulf of Mexico operations, who beat their previous spud to first production record by 3 days. Additionally, we'll continue to push the envelope on driving out cost and achieve our original capital synergies for well cost savings in the Texas Delaware and DJ Basin, almost 1 year ahead of schedule. And we are pleased to have been awarded a new concession onshore Block 5 in Abu Dhabi, which is adjacent to onshore Block 3 where we've been conducting exploration work. Following the award of Block 5, we made a multi-reservoir discovery in Block 3. We still have more exploration and appraisal work to complete, but are highly encouraged by the results to date. 
Last year, we communicated a revised framework for excess cash flow, which prioritizes maintaining our low-cost production base, reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. Our cash flow priorities remain unchanged as we do not anticipate growing production for at least this year. Our immediate goal is to continue reducing debt, and with the support of the strengthened balance sheet, return capital in a more meaningful way to our common shareholders. 
I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results and guidance for the first quarter and full year ahead."

In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share -- per diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to an approximate $850 million",896,"Thank you, Vicki. In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share -- per diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to an approximate $850 million loss on sales late to the carrying value of assets divested during the quarter. 
As Vicki mentioned, our achievements last year contributed to the improved financial position that we have today. And reducing our debt by $2.4 billion and refinancing $7 billion of near-term maturities in 2020, we have significantly derisked our financial profile. This is especially relevant considering we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of divestitures post Colombia. 
In 2020, we repaid or extended almost $6 billion of 2021 maturities to $7 billion in 2022 maturities and more than $260 million of 2023 maturity. This leaves us with less than $375 million of remaining 2021 maturity. We repaid over $9 billion of debt over the last 18 months, lowered outstanding principal to approximately $35 billion. While we were able to adequately manage this level of debt in a mid-cycle environment, our focus remains on debt reduction and strengthen the balance sheet to provide stability throughout the cycle. 
As we guided our fourth quarter, capital spending increase from the third quarter to support normalized activity levels ahead of 2021. Even as activity levels increased in the fourth quarter and we returned to paying deferred dividend and cash, we still generated approximately $800 million of free cash flow driven by the strong operational performance of our businesses and our focus on improving margins. We entered 2021 with $2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. 
We are pleased with our progress on increasing our share price since our last earnings call. Our shares have traded above the $22 strike price of the warrant we issued last year. And the shares trade above the warrant strike price, warrant holders gain the right but not the obligation to exercise those warrants and purchase Oxy shares for $22. As of January 31, approximately 12,000 warrants have been exercised, resulting in about 12,000 new leased shares. As additional warrants are exercised, we allocate the resulting cash proceeds to debt reduction. 
We are beginning to benefit the activity added in the fourth quarter. As there's often a lag between the change in activity and resulting impact on production, we expect our first quarter production to be slightly lower sequentially when compared to our fourth quarter of 2022 -- 2020. The expected production decline in the first quarter is due to the timing lag in adding activity as well as the impact of the recent storm on our operations and turnaround activity at a hose in Tulsa. 
Our first quarter prime guidance includes a 25,000 BOE per day impact in the unprecedent weather event in Texas last week. Although the storm had a meaningful impact on our Permian production, we expect the impact to be temporary as our operations recovered quickly. While our ultimate ability to recover barrels lost during the winter storm will determine if we were able to reach precisely our full year guidance, we anticipate the full year production will be essentially equivalent to our fourth quarter rate, excluding Colombia. 
Going forward, we have combined Permian Resources and EOR into single Permian entity as it relates to providing guidance and reporting results. As we further integrate our Permian operations and low-carbon strategy in oil and gas, we anticipate increased opportunities in sharing of resources. We are also guiding the Gulf of Mexico separately to provide additional clarity on seasonal production variances as we encounter by this asset. 
Our focus continues to be improving items we can influence, such as growing our cash margin through operational improvement and lowering expenses. We recognize there are certain noncash items that we have less influence over and forecast an increase in non cap expenses this year. On a per basis, we expect DD&A will rise due to higher completion rates as reserve decreased during the year. When we issue our 10-K, we would disclose the lower reserve position, reflecting significantly lower commodity price environment during 2020 and activity level lower than we had forecasted at the end of 2019. 
Our 2021 capital plan slide provides details by asset and investment. The production and capital guidance we provided for the first quarter and full year take into account the regulatory environment as we understand it today. Our high-quality asset base provides the flexibility to adjust activity and capital allocation as the environment may change. If a significant change to the regulatory environment occurs, we will provide an update to our guidance as warranted. 
For the full year, our capital plan includes running 6 rigs in Texas, Delaware, 1 in New Mexico, 4 in the Midland Basin and 2 in the Rockies. The drillship and return to the Gulf of Mexico late last year is expected to remain active throughout 2021. The flexibility embedded in our capital plan, combined with the financial improvements made last year, have placed occidental in a much stronger position for the years ahead. While we still have work to do to strengthen our balance sheet, we now have the necessary runway to continue optimizing the performance of our assets while improving our financial position. 
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

Our low carbon strategy enables Occidental to play a leading role in limiting methane emissions and removing CO2 from the atmosphere while amplifying our existing businesses and benefiting our shareholders. We expect to improve the profitability of enhanced oil recovery in the Permian and in other regions as we reduce the carbon intensity of our own emissions and products. 
As we implement our low carbon strategy, we expect to continue working cohesively with regulators under the new administration while demonstrating our commitment to safety and the environment. We expect our operations on federal land to continue and have more than 350 approved permits in New Mexico and approximately 175 in the Powder River Basin with many more pending. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have not experienced any impact to our operations. 
Following our last earnings call, we released our 2020 climate report detailing our target of reaching 0 emissions from our own operations by 2040, with an ambition to accomplish this by 2035 and an ambition to be net 0, including the use of our products by 2050. As part of our low carbon strategy, we can provide a solution for partners and other industries as well, which is airlines and utilities. Those industries may not have an alternative means to significantly lower their carbon footprint. 
As I've said before, the opportunity before us is immense, and we are ready for the challenge. Thanks to our incredible employees, we can plan through the lens of being a best-in-class, low-cost operator with an exceptional portfolio of assets in tandem with a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and executing our strategy to lead in a low-carbon world.

And so we're going to stay very committed to making sure that we get the best value for whatever we execute on, but I will say that I have some confidence that we'll get there because of the fact that we have multiple opportunities. We're not depending on just 1 or 2 possible divestitures we have in our portfolio. It's so large, so diverse. We have multiple options to choose from. So I do believe that we could get to the upper end, but it's more likely that we would target the lower end, and the timing of the lower end really depends on how quickly we can get the offers to where we need them to be. And again, we have a couple of processes in place right now and then the -- some things on hold. So it's all about value for us and getting to that number. And regardless of oil price, if the value is there, we still want to make the execution to get the divestitures to our $2 billion target, and we believe we can do that."

I would say it's not -- the way we're doing our strategy is not a necessity that we do it in association with our",951,"Well, our enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian are -- they're one of the anchors that we have for our low Carbon Ventures strategy. I would say it's not -- the way we're doing our strategy is not a necessity that we do it in association with our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian, but we believe that's the best way to do it and the best value proposition for our shareholders. So that's what we focused on initially. 
And if I could just point you to -- as I talk about the production cycle, point you to the time line, where it shows how this idea was originally brought up. It was our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian. They were the reason that we started this vision, and we started the vision more than 10 years ago. We started the vision well before 2008, where you see on the time line that the original 45 Q tax credit was established. 
We were a part -- or our government group was a part of helping to get 45 Q tax credit approved and put in place. And so back then, what we started looking at was how to maximize the vast resources that we had already in conventional reservoirs that were conducive to CO2 enhanced oil recovery. So that started the process back then. What we wanted to do is we wanted to come up with a way to have a lower cost, long term, no decline supply of CO2, and that's why we came up with the CO2 auction. So you see in 2010, it's when our century CO2 plant came on, and it's capturing CO2 delivering it to our Denver unit in West Texas. And the Denver unit MRV plan, you can see we got approved in 2015. The Denver unit is one of our largest CO2 projects. We are continuing to add reserves to it even today. It's massive. And so that and in addition to the hubs MRV plan that we got in 2017, it's important to note that we were the company that got the first 2 permits ever issued by the EPA for the sequestration and capture of CO2 in the reservoir. 
And the MRV is, it means monitoring, reporting and verification. It's just a plan that ensures that you -- when you put the CO2 on the ground, you have properly sequestered it. So we got the first 2 of those. And that whole process, as we started getting that done, was to try to take advantage of the more than a billion barrels of resources that we have left to develop in our current holdings and conventional reservoirs in the Permian. And as you know, the Permian is so vast, we have lots of ability to expand way beyond that. 
And I know you didn't ask the rest of this question, but I do want to talk about what started as a vision to improve our cost structure and extend our ability to develop even more resources in the EOR business. It's now turned into more than that. It's turned into an ability for us to create a new business, a new business that not only will add additional value for our shareholders over time, but reduces emissions in the world. And it helps -- we'll be the leaders in helping to test technology, the direct air capture technology, put it in place, make it operational and commercial, and that will be -- will provide an opportunity for others to expand it in the world. 
And so moving to what that does beyond our enhanced oil recovery in the Permian, you have to look at some of the things that are a part of what we're doing. In 2018, another thing that was critical for us was when 45 Q was expanded. And when we -- when it was expanded and approved by Congress, it enabled us to make this commercial, the first direct air capture and carbon capture from industry commercial. So that was an important step. Then we established our low carbon ventures group. We joined the oil and gas climate initiative. We teamed up with wide energy to capture CO2 from their project. We did some other things around emissions, too. We announced our Goldsmith solar project, and 2 other things that we did is we invested in net power in 2018. 
Net power is a technology that will generate electricity at a lower cost in a typical power plant and with the opportunity to capture the CO2 as a part of the process so that we can a sequester it in our oil reservoirs. And then the start of 2019, we invested in carbon engineering, and carbon engineering has the technology that we will use as a part of our direct air capture process to pull CO2 from the air into but then sequestered in our oil reservoirs. And you can see through there, there are other things that we continue to do over time that's led us to where we are today. There is -- won't go through and read all of those, but there's a lot that's been done. And the foundation has been very meticulously planned and staged, and now the foundation is set for us to finish some of the processes that we have and discussions that we have in place today to get to a point where this really becomes a business that has 3 ways of benefiting us and benefits the world. And so without going through and reading the rest of that, I'll go ahead and stop here and let you answer or ask your follow-up."

Worley is they're an incredible company. They're -- they have also a passion around carbon capture and around doing the things that they need to do to also become carbon neutral. And I want to point out in all the partnerships that we've developed so far, all the partnerships have been with people who share our vision and our commitment that this is -- has to create value for our shareholders, but it's also the right thing to do for our operations and for the world. 
All of these guys share the same thing. United Airlines, who is partnering with us, too, to build this direct air capture, they should share the same vision that we do. They're committed to become carbon neutral. So selecting Worley and having them on board with the commitment that they have and to get the FEED study done, that's going to be a significant milestone for us. And we're hoping to get that done by 2022. And then the construction beyond that would take about 18 months to 2 years, but we're very confident in the -- that the technology will work because every part of the direct air capture is being used in some way somewhere. And as I think I said on the last earnings call, one of the key things that's needed in there as a part of it is that hydroxide, which we use a lot of anyway. And so we're familiar with what we need to use. We're familiar with the pieces and parts, and I have confidence that our team in working with Worley to work out the details. 
We'll do the same thing that we've been able to do in Al Hosn where that was a very complex facility that we built there. And I know I belabored this probably too much, but that was incredibly impressive to build a facility out the middle of the desk at that huge and the sulfur recovery units that are a part of Al Hosn were very, very unique and different. And I don't think there are any that are that large and anywhere else in the world. But we working with our partners, ADNOC, we're able to make that work right off the bat without any kind of glitch. And not only made it work, so we were able to expand it by 30% with just an incremental $10 million off of the $10 billion that it took to build it. 
So our major projects team knows how to build things. Worley is very, very experienced and knowledgeable. I think between the 2 of us, our team and them, I think we have a great chance to build with this first one. And the first one is always more costly than the next ones to come because we -- you learn a lot from it. But I believe we'll learn a lot from building this first one and making it as efficient as we can be and then learning as we get it online, how to make it even more efficient."

Rob, when I'm looking at your presentation, in terms of the cash flow priority, I'm actually surprised that you put retiring the preferred equity at the bottom, given it's actually pretty high 2.8%. So just wondering that why that would not be a higher priority for you to retire such a high coupon debt to some degree, I mean, even though you start deferred equity from our standpoint, it's no different than the debt. So maybe that you can elaborate a little bit of the thinking. 
Secondly, back on your Page 15, I think you gave some data about the Permian, 11 rigs that you're going to run and the number of wells. And since that that's including the yield out now, so can you break it down, the number of rigs that is related to the unconventional and the number of wells that you're going to come on stream? And in terms of the trajectory, is that a pretty steady program variable throughout the year? Or that is more happy bottom? Or that is early happy or that is bottom happy in terms of the program?"

So to answer your question, it does conceptually include Permian EOR now that we're guiding those 2 businesses together. But I can tell you, there aren't any drilling rigs in Permian EOR plan for this year. 
And as for trajectory, it's -- I would say it's relatively flat except -- Q1's got a few -- it's not a huge difference, but a little bit fewer wells coming on than you do in Q2, 3 and 4, and that's just because of the ramp-up trajectory. So if you look back, we averaged 2 rigs in the third quarter of '20, 5 rigs in the fourth quarter of '20, and then now we're going to average about 12 rigs in Q1. So when you just think about that trajectory and how the wells online lag that, it makes sense for Q1 to be a little bit lighter, but it's -- there's not a huge difference between those. And I'll let Rob take your first one."

Frankly, obviously, we're focused on the top 2 pieces of the project list right now. 
As it relates to the Berkshire, so the way the agreement works is that in order to retire principal, we would have to have at least a $4 per share common distribution over a 12-month period to open up pain on a one-for-one basis down on the Berkshire preferred principle. And so certainly, we don't foresee that type of distribution on the common in the near-term future to open it up. To do anything outside of that would require an agreement with Berkshire in order to make a reduction in the actual principle in the near term. It's not that we're not aware of the fact that our ability to source capital is well below the coupon rate today, but we don't have the ability to force that upon the situation as we sit today."

So just first, can you maybe give us an update or a review of your existing pipeline infrastructure and your ability to capture revenue from just the 45 Q tax credits and sequestering carbon? 
And sort of as we think about, I think you've made comments, Vicki, about revenue from your carbon business matching your oil business in a couple of decades from now, how big does -- how big of a role is directly our capture versus using your existing infrastructure?"
293286,701179890,2219676,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Our plan is to use both. As you may know, we have the largest infrastructure of any CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the world in the Permian.

As you may know, we have the largest infrastructure of any CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the world in the Permian. We have the pipelines that we need to move the CO2 around to wherever we need it to go in -- for our own fields. We also have the gas processing plants and the supporting infrastructure for those plants and the pipelines. So that's why when we think about how to maximize and continue to develop the EOR reserves, that's our preference. 
And as I've mentioned in -- when I was going through the time line, the deal that we made with Wide Energy, they're an ethanol company. So they have 2 plants in the Permian Basin, and they're -- not in the Permian Basin, I'm sorry. They have 2 plants in Texas, and their plants are not too far from a pipeline that will get that CO2 to our infrastructure in the Permian. So that's why we did the deal with them. 
We've also teamed up with a cement plant in Colorado to do the same thing, and that plant there will tie into a pipeline that we have coming from Southern Colorado all the way down to the Permian. So we'll be getting CO2 from that plant into the pipeline and to our EOR operations in the Permian. So it's that infrastructure that we're trying to definitely take advantage of. 
But the really good thing about the direct air capture and the thing that some people have missed is you can put direct air capture anywhere because you don't need to put it where the pollution is because the winds balance the concentration of CO2 around the world. So what we can do with the direct air capture, put it right close to the facility or the reservoir that we want to put it into. That's why it makes us possible to have direct air capture in the Permian and the DJ, the Powder River, Oman and ultimately, and hopefully, in Algeria, too. So we can put it anywhere we want, and this creates opportunities way beyond the Permian. We wanted to prove it up in the Permian because that is the best place for -- almost in the world for enhanced oil recovery. The utilization of the CO2 is best there. And so we've got a good option, good opportunity to maximize our infrastructure. Nobody else has the scale that we do and the size that we do and the opportunity that we have. So we're very, very excited about it. And we do believe that over the next 5 to 10 years that the benefits of our low carbon business will equal our chemical business. And then as you said, ultimately, it's going to be as profitable and deliver as much as our oil and gas business does."

But we're -- I'm most excited about the direct air capture because of where we can put it, and the maritime industry, the airline industry, the tech industry. We're having conversations with companies from all of those industries. 
And the thing that we really need to have in place and what we're working on, too, is to ensure that we have -- that there is a way and a certified process to track the CO2 molecule from the reservoir to its end use. And as that matures, then we're going to be able to ensure that as we build these partnerships that the partners we have will be able to take full credit for what their investment should provide them while we do the same.

It's just like solar and wind. I can tell you that I hear the most negative comments from those who have a reason to say that solar and wind are profitable today, a direct air capture never will be. Reality is there's never been a commercial plant built that -- where you can optimize the process like we're going to do. We do expect -- and as I said earlier, the first plant will be the most expensive, but I don't believe it's going to take very many plants for us to build to get it to the point where it is economical and does not need the credits. Initially, we do need the credit, but we're very close to being in a position to -- for the credits to go away, we believe, because of the fact that we're -- if you couple a direct air capture with an oil reservoir and you don't have to build a pipeline to take it very far, you've already there optimized the cost of the initial bill and the ability to get it in place and make it operate. And every component in the direct air capture is working somewhere, so it's a matter of just putting the components together and getting them to be more efficient. 
I believe, like any new technology, that the cost definitely will come down. How quickly it will come down, I think, is going to be driven by the expertise, experience, commitment and drive of those working on it. I can tell you our team in Worley, the reason we selected them is because they clearly have a vision on how to make this work, and they're committed to it as our team. And so I have high confidence that over time and not too long a time but then second or third unit, we're going to have it down to the level where credits are not going to be needed.

So that will get us through at least another couple of years from a capital efficiency standpoint. 
If you asked us to guess where we're going to be, it's difficult to do that because I wouldn't have expected would be as low as where we are today 3 years ago when we were doing this business as the teams continue to get better. 
And just as an example, our capital intensity in the resources business will be half this year of what it was 2 years ago. And that's in a year where we're ramping up capital, so usually that works the opposite way. So our teams continue to get better and better. So while I would hate to guess on what that's going to be, it wouldn't surprise me to see it be a little bit higher than a $1.2 billion 3 or 4 years from now, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful change from that number to hold our Permian Basin flat. I think you'll get puts and takes. Our decline continues to come down, as you saw the corporate decline going from 25% to 22%. That's largely driven by our improvements in our unconventional businesses, both in Permian resources going from 37 to 33. Also in the Rockies, that's coming down to about 33. So I continue to expect that to improve a bit. And as the teams get better and better, that should also help with that capital intensity going forward.

So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over the cycle, that delivers the most Baer shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020 that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021. So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021. We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20, natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to a cost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on that oil -- on the gas side. 
We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus not doing so. As you can imagine, we do a pure put. It's still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type color hedge is going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending one into 2022. And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge against downturns in the business in the near term. We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And so we have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to kind of continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive in the future."

And if something were to pick up later in the year, is the priority to maintain the production if it requires raising the CapEx a bit for the inflation? Or would you be more inclined to stick hard to the 2x budget?"

I mean we've seen that both flexing up and down generally as a pretty good guide for us with that $10 change in commodity price. We see that type of inflation, deflation. It's a little different this time, and you guys are looking at it really closely. Most of the time in the past, changes in oil price correlated with changes in activity. And so this time, as you know, we've seen a pretty strong run-up in commodity price slightly. We haven't seen the correlative activity change that we historically see with that. And so really, when you kind of layer down where a lot of the inflationary pressures come from, it's from changes in activity and the need for resources and so on. 
So this time, looks a little bit different. We're not seeing huge inflationary pressures yet. Of course, there's parts of the market that are driven by housing starts, more than they are, a number of frac crews running and things like that. And so you get little puts and takes. And what we do know and what we see, we have built into the budget. So it wasn't absent of any of that, but it was largely poured on a lower price environment. But we don't expect with what we see at least right now, that number to have to change materially or inflationary reasons. A little early in the year. But at least with what we see right now, we don't expect that to change."

I mean, I'd say the same thing. So I mean, the GoM is interesting. And so let me hit on that one first. I mean you see what its capital is this year. I think it, yes, if we looked at that over a long period of time, as you know, its capital tends to",519,"Yes. I mean, I'd say the same thing. So I mean, the GoM is interesting. And so let me hit on that one first. I mean you see what its capital is this year. I think it, yes, if we looked at that over a long period of time, as you know, its capital tends to be a little more lumpy. It comes in bigger chunks than it does in the Permian or DJ because one well doesn't just cost a few million dollars. There's much more that goes with that, and there's tieback costs and things like that. 
So if I was going to characterize the GoM, I mean as you know, our strategy is generally around high-return tiebacks. The teams have been super successful with what they've been doing. And I think Vicki hit on the first 2 wells that they drilled, the top sea drilling dynamics are coming in at cost 35% less than where they were in 2019. So that's really going to help when you look at sustaining capital, and we're having good success delineating new reservoirs around our platforms. So a lot of good things happening there. 
But to explicitly answer your question, if you looked over a 5-year period, I would expect the sustaining capital to be higher than the number that we have this year. It may be a couple of hundred million in a given year higher than what we have this year. But it's, again, not a huge difference from where we are this year, but probably a bit higher over a 5- year period. 
When you look at the DJ, it's probably similar to what we said on the Permian. Again, the performance improvements are making. I know we talk about this a lot, a lot, but I am astonished at all our businesses and what they're doing. And let's look at the Rockies, you look at their rig release to rig release time in the fourth quarter. For the 2 rigs they ran, it was 4.3 days. That was 27% better than what it was in 2019, and that's in a restart period. So again, they're doing really, really well. Same thing on our EOR business, one we don't talk a lot about, they pulled over $350 million out of their OpEx last year, and that largely is sustainable this year. 
So you look at those things and all of those kind of benefits are going to flow through to the sustaining capital as we look a few years out. So for DJ, I'd give a very similar answer, and it could be a little bit higher than what we're seeing this year just because of the number of DUCs we brought in this year, but it's not going to be a huge material change. 
So we feel pretty confident with our 2.9%, maybe a little bit higher if you're in a much higher commodity price world for a longer period of time, but we don't see a change in 30%, 40%, that kind of thing. We feel pretty confident about that for the next few years."

With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production",1433,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year of extreme volatility for our industry and the world. With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production at our fourth quarter 2020 rate. 
 
 We entered 2021 with an improved financial position by taking the necessary steps to protect our asset base and derisk our balance sheet. I'm particularly proud of our teams who leveraged our technical expertise to mitigate production decline while relentlessly lowering costs. The capability of our outstanding employees to consistently deliver remarkable results safely was key to our ability to navigate the challenges of the last year as well as the challenges presented by the winter storm last week. 
 
 This morning, we'll provide the details of our full year 2021 plan. This plan maintains our best-in-class capital intensity, even with the modest activity increase we started in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also provide an update on our divestiture and deleveraging progress as well as reviewing our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. 
 
 Throughout 2020, we focused on maintaining the integrity of our production and asset base as well as lowering overhead and operating costs. Our achievements have positioned us to build on our track record of operational excellence and efficiency gains as we stabilize production in 2021. In the fourth quarter, our businesses continued to outperform and generate momentum for a strong start to this year. We exceeded our production guidance while continuing to deliver lower-than-expected operating costs for the quarter. Our oil and gas operating cost of $6.80 per BOE and domestic operating costs of $6.05 per BOE continue to demonstrate the lasting impact of our cost reduction measures as our domestic operating costs were significantly below our original expectations for the year. 
 
 Although our activity slowed in the second and third quarters, our teams did not miss a step as we normalized activity in the fourth quarter. Our onshore domestic assets went from running 22 drilling rigs in the first quarter, down to 0 in the second quarter and then returning to 11 rigs by the end of the year. Operationally, we continue to outperform our expectations and deliver efficiency improvements with new drilling and completion records. Our Texas Delaware and DJ Basin teams demonstrated our consistent drive for efficiency by exceeding our original well cost synergy targets in the quarter, an achievement we're very proud of. 
 
 No matter how favorable or challenging the environment in which we operate, we never take our eye off safety. Many of our teams tied or set new safety records last year, while our company-wide performance was our best ever as we simultaneously work to minimize the risk from COVID. 
 
 We transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position, having achieved our divestiture target for 2020. We closed approximately $2.8 billion of asset sales, $2.4 billion of which closed in the fourth quarter. In 2020, we utilized the divestiture proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt and liabilities by approximately $2.4 billion and $300 million, respectively. 
 
 We also completed a successful refinancing program, extending approximately $7 billion of debt maturities. Together, these achievements place us in a strong position for the year ahead, so we can focus on reducing debt and improving our business while maximizing the value of our unmatched asset base. 
 
 The progress we made last year in reducing operating costs will continue into 2021 as the synergies we delivered and the vast majority of our additional cost savings remain in place. These savings are now embedded in our ongoing operations. We expect to deliver overhead of $1.8 billion, which represents full retention of all synergies and a significant portion of our additional cost reductions. We'll continuously seek new opportunities to lower costs and expand margins as we move forward. We expect to spend $2.9 billion of capital in 2021 to sustain our production at our fourth quarter production rate. 
 
 Our plans are based on a $40 WTI price environment, and we are prepared to flex spending lower, if necessary. If oil prices continue to improve this year, we will not increase capital in support of production growth. The flexibility and optionality that our scale and asset base provide are often underappreciated. We are equipped to adjust to future potential commodity price dips or regulatory changes while being positioned to leverage the benefits of future price uplift. Likewise, our capital and spending plans retain a high degree of flexibility, allowing us to adapt to a changing macro environment. 
 
 The level of capital spending required in 2021 to sustain our production demonstrates our ability to deliver best-in-class capital intensity even in a period where we are not growing production. Leveraging our technical expertise, particularly in subsurface characterization, enables us to drill the best wells while we continue to pursue new ways to lower costs with the goal of spending less to produce more barrels. The efficiency of our capital development, coupled with our low base decline and our relentless pursuit of maximizing every barrel from our existing wells, allows us to hold our production flat with capital of $2.9 billion in 2021. 
 
 We are pleased with the progress achieved to date in closing divestitures and reducing debt, especially given the challenging market in 2020. We exceeded our $2 billion divestiture target with the closing of the mineral and surface acreage in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah as well as our onshore assets in Colombia. Post Colombia, we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of asset sales to be announced by mid-2021. We are making progress towards this new target and have already closed approximately $350 million of transactions. 
 
 As we near the end of our large-scale divestiture program, we will continue to balance transaction timing with price realization. We'll not sacrifice value to close transactions quickly. As commodity prices continue to strengthen, we expect the value that buyers place on assets to adjust accordingly. We will always prioritize obtaining value for our shareholders over meeting a deadline or divestiture target, which we've imposed upon ourselves. 
 
 As Rob will speak to you in a moment, our debt reduction efforts, combined with our ability to refinance $7 billion of near-term maturities over the last year, places us in a favorable position. We continuously review our portfolio to ensure we have the optimal mix of free cash flow generation, capital efficiency and low decline assets. We now have one of the best portfolios in Oxy's 100-year history, but this doesn't mean that we have stopped looking for opportunities to improve our asset base. 
 
 We frequently complete acreage trades to core up positions in operatorship, and on occasion, may pursue opportunities where we see outstanding value with the bolt-on acquisition. For example, we recently exercised a preferential right to increase our working interest in the Lucius project, which we operate in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect that our investment will pay back in slightly over a year in a $40 oil price environment. 
 
 Our oil and gas highlights slides includes just a few of the many achievements our business delivered in the fourth quarter. Even during a period of increasing activity, we continue to improve uptime and reduce time to market by lowering drilling and completion times. This includes our Gulf of Mexico operations, who beat their previous spud to first production record by 3 days. 
 
 Additionally, we'll continue to push the envelope on driving out cost and achieve our original capital synergies for well cost savings in the Texas Delaware and DJ Basin, almost 1 year ahead of schedule. And we are pleased to have been awarded a new concession, onshore Block 5 in Abu Dhabi, which is adjacent to onshore Block 3 where we've been conducting exploration work. Following the award of Block 5, we made a multi-reservoir discovery in Block 3. We still have more exploration and appraisal work to complete, but are highly encouraged by the results to date. 
 
 Last year, we communicated a revised framework for excess cash flow, which prioritizes maintaining our low-cost production base, reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. Our cash flow priorities remain unchanged as we do not anticipate growing production for at least this year. Our immediate goal is to continue reducing debt, and with the support of the strengthened balance sheet, return capital in a more meaningful way to our common shareholders. 
 
 I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results and guidance for the first quarter and full year ahead."

In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share [indiscernible] per diluted share.

In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share [indiscernible] per diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to an approximate $850 million loss on sales related to the carrying value of assets divested during the quarter. 
 
 As Vicki mentioned, our achievements last year contributed to the improved financial position that we have today. And reducing our debt by $2.4 billion and refinancing $7 billion of near-term maturities in 2020, we have significantly derisked our financial profile. This is especially relevant considering we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of divestitures post Colombia. 
 
 In 2020, we repaid or extended almost $6 billion of 2021 maturities to $7 billion in 2022 maturities and more than $260 million of 2023 maturity. This leaves us with less than $375 million of remaining 2021 maturity. We repaid over $9 billion of debt over the last 18 months, lowered outstanding principal to approximately $35 billion. While we were able to adequately manage this level of debt in a mid-cycle environment, our focus remains on debt reduction and strengthen the balance sheet to provide stability throughout the cycle. 
 
 As we guided our fourth quarter, capital spending increase from the third quarter to support normalized activity levels ahead of 2021. Even as activity levels increased in the fourth quarter and we returned to paying deferred dividend and cash, we still generated approximately $800 million of free cash flow, driven by the strong operational performance of our businesses and our focus on improving margins. We entered 2021 with $2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. 
 
 We are pleased with our progress on increasing our share price since our last earnings call. Our shares have traded above the $22 strike price of the warrant we issued last year. And the shares trade above the warrant strike price, warrant holders gain the right but not the obligation to exercise those warrants and purchase Oxy shares for $22. As of January 31, approximately 12,000 warrants have been exercised, resulting in about 12,000 new leased shares. As additional warrants are exercised, we allocate the resulting cash proceeds to debt reduction. 
 
 We are beginning to benefit the activity added in the fourth quarter. As there's often a lag between the change in activity and resulting impact on production, we expect our first quarter production to be slightly lower sequentially when compared to our fourth quarter of 2022 -- 2020. The expected production decline in the first quarter is due to the timing lag in adding activity as well as the impact of the recent storm on our operations and turnaround activity at a [indiscernible] in Tulsa. 
 
 Our first quarter Permian guidance includes a 25,000 BOE per day impact in the unprecedent weather event in Texas last week. Although the storm had a meaningful impact on our Permian production, we expect the impact to be temporary as our operations recovered quickly. While our ultimate ability to recover barrels lost during the winter storm will determine if we were able to reach precisely our full year guidance, we anticipate the full year production will be essentially equivalent to our fourth quarter rate, excluding Colombia. 
 
 Going forward, we have combined Permian Resources and EOR into single Permian entity as it relates to providing guidance and reporting results. As we further integrate our Permian operations and low-carbon strategy in oil and gas, we anticipate increased opportunities in sharing of resources. We are also guiding the Gulf of Mexico separately to provide additional clarity on seasonal production variances as we encounter by this asset. 
 
 Our focus continues to be improving items we can influence, such as growing our cash margin through operational improvement and lowering expenses. We recognize there are certain noncash items that we have less influence over and forecast an increase in non cap expenses this year. On a per barrel basis, we expect DD&A will rise due to higher completion rates as reserve decreased during the year. When we issue our 10-K, we would disclose the lower reserve position, reflecting significantly lower commodity price environment during 2020 and activity level lower than we had forecasted at the end of 2019. 
 
 Our 2021 capital plan slide provides details by asset and investment. The production and capital guidance we provided for the first quarter and full year take into account the regulatory environment as we understand it today. Our high-quality asset base provides the flexibility to adjust activity and capital allocation as the environment may change. If a significant change to the regulatory environment occurs, we will provide an update to our guidance as warranted. 
 
 For the full year, our capital plan includes running 6 rigs in Texas, Delaware, 1 in New Mexico, 4 in the Midland Basin and 2 in the Rockies. The drillship and return to the Gulf of Mexico late last year is expected to remain active throughout 2021. The flexibility embedded in our capital plan, combined with the financial improvements made last year, have placed Occidental in a much stronger position for the years ahead. While we still have work to do to strengthen our balance sheet, we now have the necessary runway to continue optimizing the performance of our assets while improving our financial position. 
 
 I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

Our low carbon strategy enables Occidental to play a leading role in limiting methane emissions and removing CO2 from the atmosphere while amplifying our existing businesses and benefiting our shareholders. We expect to improve the profitability of enhanced oil recovery in the Permian and in other regions as we reduce the carbon intensity of our own emissions and products. 
 
 As we implement our low carbon strategy, we expect to continue working cohesively with regulators under the new administration while demonstrating our commitment to safety and the environment. We expect our operations on federal land to continue and have more than 350 approved permits in New Mexico and approximately 175 in the Powder River Basin with many more pending. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have not experienced any impact to our operations. 
 
 Following our last earnings call, we released our 2020 climate report detailing our target of reaching 0 emissions from our own operations by 2040, with an ambition to accomplish this by 2035 and an ambition to be net 0, including the use of our products by 2050. As part of our low carbon strategy, we can provide a solution for partners and other industries as well, which is airlines and utilities. Those industries may not have an alternative means to significantly lower their carbon footprint. 
 
 As I've said before, the opportunity before us is immense, and we are ready for the challenge. Thanks to our incredible employees, we can plan through the lens of being a best-in-class, low-cost operator with an exceptional portfolio of assets in tandem with a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and executing our strategy to lead in a low-carbon world.

And so we're going to stay very committed to making sure that we get the best value for whatever we execute on, but I will say that I have some confidence that we'll get there because of the fact that we have multiple opportunities. 
 
 We're not depending on just 1 or 2 possible divestitures we have in our portfolio. It's so large, so diverse. We have multiple options to choose from. So I do believe that we could get to the upper end, but that's more likely that we would target the lower end, and the timing of the lower end really depends on how quickly we can get the offers to where we need them to be.

And regardless of oil price, if the value is there, we still want to make the execution to get the divestitures to our $2 billion target, and we believe we can do that."

 And then the second part is, on Slide 38, focuses very much, I think, largely from a low-carbon pathway on the upstream side, arguably maybe with a more U.S. onshore bench. And I wondered if you could talk about the opportunities you see in petrochemicals and international to aid your decarbonization goals."

I would say it's not -- the way we're doing our strategy is not a necessity that we do it in association with our",950,"Well, our enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian are -- they're one of the anchors that we have for our low Carbon Ventures strategy. I would say it's not -- the way we're doing our strategy is not a necessity that we do it in association with our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian, but we believe that's the best way to do it and the best value proposition for our shareholders. So that's what we focused on initially. 
 
 And if I could just point you to -- as I talk about the production cycle, point you to the time line, where it shows how this idea was originally brought up. It was our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian. They were the reason that we started this vision, and we started the vision more than 10 years ago. We started the vision well before 2008, where you see on the time line that the original 45Q tax credit was established. 
 
 We were a part -- or our government group was a part of helping to get 45Q tax credit approved and put in place. And so back then, what we started looking at was how to maximize the vast resources that we had already in conventional reservoirs that were conducive to CO2 enhanced oil recovery. So that started the process back then. What we wanted to do is we wanted to come up with a way to have a lower cost, long term, no decline supply of CO2, and that's why we came up with the [indiscernible] CO2 auction. 
 
 So you see in 2010, it's when our century CO2 plant came on, and it's capturing CO2 delivering it to our Denver unit in West Texas. And the Denver unit MRV plan, you can see we got approved in 2015. The Denver unit is one of our largest CO2 projects. We are continuing to add reserves to it even today. It's massive. And so that and in addition to the hubs MRV plan that we got in 2017, it's important to note that we were the company that got the first 2 permits ever issued by the EPA for the sequestration and capture of CO2 in the reservoir. 
 
 And the MRV is, it means monitoring, reporting and verification. It's just a plan that ensures that you -- when you put the CO2 on the ground, you have properly sequestered it. So we got the first 2 of those. And that whole process, as we started getting that done, was to try to take advantage of the more than a billion barrels of resources that we have left to develop in our current holdings and conventional reservoirs in the Permian. And as you know, the Permian is so vast, we have lots of ability to expand way beyond that. 
 
 And I know you didn't ask the rest of this question, but I do want to talk about what started as a vision to improve our cost structure and extend our ability to develop even more resources in the EOR business. It's now turned into more than that. It's turned into an ability for us to create a new business, a new business that not only will add additional value for our shareholders over time, but reduces emissions in the world. 
 
 And it helps -- we'll be the leaders in helping to test technology, the direct air capture technology, put it in place, make it operational and commercial, and that will be -- will provide an opportunity for others to expand it in the world. 
 
 And so moving to what that does beyond our enhanced oil recovery in the Permian, you have to look at some of the things that are a part of what we're doing. In 2018, another thing that was critical for us was when 45Q was expanded. And when we -- when it was expanded and approved by Congress, it enabled us to make this commercial, the first direct air capture and carbon capture from industry commercial. So that was an important step. 
 
 Then we established our low carbon ventures group. We joined the oil and gas climate initiative. We teamed up with wide energy to capture CO2 from their project. We did some other things around emissions, too. We announced our Goldsmith solar project, and 2 other things that we did is we invested in net power in 2018. 
 
 Net power is a technology that will generate electricity at a lower cost than a typical power plant and with the opportunity to capture the CO2 as a part of the process so that we can a sequester it in our oil reservoirs. And then the start of 2019, we invested in carbon engineering, and carbon engineering has the technology that we will use as a part of our direct air capture process to pull CO2 from the air into -- but then sequestered in our oil reservoirs. 
 
 And you can see through there, there are other things that we continue to do over time that's led us to where we are today. There is -- won't go through and read all of those, but there's a lot that's been done. And the foundation has been very meticulously planned and staged, and now the foundation is set for us to finish some of the processes that we have and discussions that we have in place today to get to a point where this really becomes a business that has 3 ways of benefiting us and benefits the world. And so without going through and reading the rest of that, I'll go ahead and stop here and let you answer or ask your follow-up."

Worley is they're an incredible company. They're -- they have also a passion around carbon capture and around doing the things that they need to do to also become carbon neutral. And I want to point out in all the partnerships that we've developed so far, all the partnerships have been with people who share our vision and our commitment that this is -- has to create value for our shareholders, but it's also the right thing to do for our operations and for the world. 
 
 All of these guys share the same thing. United Airlines, who is partnering with us, too, to build this direct air capture, they all share the same vision that we do. They're committed to become carbon-neutral. So selecting Worley and having them on board with the commitment that they have and to get the FEED study done, that's going to be a significant milestone for us. And we're hoping to get that done by 2022. And then the construction beyond that would take about 18 months to 2 years, but we're very confident in the -- that the technology will work because every part of the direct air capture is being used in some way somewhere. 
 
 And as I think I said on the last earnings call, one of the key things that's needed in there as a part of it is that hydroxide, which we use a lot of anyway. And so we're familiar with what we need to use. We're familiar with the pieces and parts, and I have confidence that our team in working with Worley to work out the details. 
 
 We'll do the same thing that we've been able to do in Al Hosn where that was a very complex facility that we built there. And I know I belabored this probably too much, but that was incredibly impressive to build a facility out the middle of the desk at that huge, and the sulfur recovery units that are a part of Al Hosn were very, very unique and different. 
 
 And I don't think there are any that are that large and anywhere else in the world. But we working with our partners, ADNOC, we're able to make that work right off the bat without any kind of glitch. And not only made it work, so we were able to expand it by 30% with just an incremental $10 million off of the $10 billion that it took to build it. 
 
 So our major projects team knows how to build things. Worley is very, very experienced and knowledgeable. I think between the 2 of us, our team and them, I think we have a great chance to build with this first one. And the first one is always more costly than the next ones to come because we -- you learn a lot from it. But I believe we'll learn a lot from building this first one and making it as efficient as we can be. And then learning as we get it online, how to make it even more efficient."

I mean, even though you start deferred equity from our standpoint, it's no different than the debt. So maybe that you can elaborate a little bit of the thinking. 
 
 Secondly, back on your Page 15, I think you gave some data about the Permian, 11 rigs that you're going to run and the number of wells. And since that that's including the yield out now, so can you break it down, the number of rigs that is related to the unconventional and the number of wells that you're going to come on stream? And in terms of the trajectory, is that a pretty steady program variable throughout the year? Or that is more happy bottom? Or that is early happy or that is bottom happy in terms of the program?"

 And as for trajectory, it's -- I would say it's relatively flat except -- Q1's got a few -- it's not a huge difference, but a little bit fewer wells coming on than you do in Q2, 3 and 4, and that's just because of the ramp-up trajectory. So if you look back, we averaged 2 rigs in the third quarter of '20, 5 rigs in the fourth quarter of '20, and then now we're going to average about 12 rigs in Q1. So when you just think about that trajectory and how the wells online lag that, it makes sense for Q1 to be a little bit lighter, but it's -- there's not a huge difference between those. And I'll let Rob take your first one."

As you may know, we have the largest infrastructure of any CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the world in the Permian. We have the pipelines that we need to move the CO2 around to wherever we need it to go in -- for our own fields. We also have the gas processing plants and the supporting infrastructure for those plants and the pipelines. So that's why when we think about how to maximize and continue to develop the EOR reserves, that's our preference. 
 
 And as I've mentioned in -- when I was going through the time line, the deal that we made with Wide Energy, they're an ethanol company. So they have 2 plants in the Permian Basin, and they're -- not in the Permian Basin, I'm sorry. They have 2 plants in Texas, and their plants are not too far from a pipeline that will get that CO2 to our infrastructure in the Permian. So that's why we did the deal with them. 
 
 We've also teamed up with a cement plant in Colorado to do the same thing, and that plant there will tie into a pipeline that we have coming from Southern Colorado all the way down to the Permian. So we'll be getting CO2 from that plant into the pipeline and to our EOR operations in the Permian. So it's that infrastructure that we're trying to definitely take advantage of. 
 
 But the really good thing about the direct air capture and the thing that some people have missed is you can put direct air capture anywhere because you don't need to put it where the pollution is because the winds balance the concentration of CO2 around the world. So what we can do with the direct air capture, put it right close to the facility or the reservoir that we want to put it into. That's why it makes us possible to have direct air capture in the Permian and the DJ, the Powder River, Oman and ultimately -- and hopefully, in Algeria, too. So we can put it anywhere we want. 
 
 And this creates opportunities way beyond the Permian. We wanted to prove it up in the Permian because that is the best place for -- almost in the world for enhanced oil recovery. The utilization of the CO2 is best there. And so we've got a good option, good opportunity to maximize our infrastructure. Nobody else has the scale that we do and the size that we do and the opportunity that we have. So we're very, very excited about it. And we do believe that over the next 5 to 10 years that the benefits of our low carbon business will equal our chemical business. And then as you said, ultimately, it's going to be as profitable and deliver as much as our oil and gas business does."

Reality is there's never been a commercial plant built that -- where you can optimize the process like we're going to do. 
 
 We do expect -- and as I said earlier, the first plant will be the most expensive, but I don't believe it's going to take very many plants for us to build to get it to the point where it is economical and does not need the credits. Initially, we do need the credit, but we're very close to being in a position to -- for the credits to go away, we believe, because of the fact that we're -- if you couple a direct air capture with an oil reservoir and you don't have to build a pipeline to take it very far, you've already there optimized the cost of the initial bill and the ability to get it in place and make it operate. And every component in the direct air capture is working somewhere, so it's a matter of just putting the components together and getting them to be more efficient. 
 
 I believe, like any new technology, that the cost definitely will come down. How quickly it will come down, I think, is going to be driven by the expertise, experience, commitment and drive of those working on it. I can tell you our team in Worley, the reason we selected them is because they clearly have a vision on how to make this work, and they're committed to it as our team.

I know there's some gross net issues with some of the TIL guidance this year, but how do you anticipate that $1.2 billion being sustainable?"
293286,701179890,2219932,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Yes. I mean, you mentioned a couple of points there, and let me hit on them. So like the Midland Basin JV, it's very helpful from a capital intensity standpoint. If you look at that, where the 750 carry or through, we've still got a little more than 600 l",323,"Yes. I mean, you mentioned a couple of points there, and let me hit on them. So like the Midland Basin JV, it's very helpful from a capital intensity standpoint. If you look at that, where the 750 carry or through, we've still got a little more than 600 left on that. So that will get us through at least another couple of years from a capital efficiency standpoint. 
 
 If you asked us to guess where we're going to be, it's difficult to do that because I wouldn't have expected would be as low as where we are today 3 years ago when we were doing this business as the teams continue to get better. 
 
 And just as an example, our capital intensity in the resources business will be half this year of what it was 2 years ago. And that's in a year where we're ramping up capital, so usually that works the opposite way. So our teams continue to get better and better. So while I would hate to guess on what that's going to be, it wouldn't surprise me to see it be a little bit higher than a $1.2 billion, 3 or 4 years from now, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful change from that number to hold our Permian Basin flat. 
 
 I think you'll get puts and takes. Our decline continues to come down, as you saw the corporate decline going from 25% to 22%. That's largely driven by our improvements in our unconventional businesses, both in Permian resources going from 37 to 33. Also in the Rockies, that's coming down to about 33. So I continue to expect that to improve a bit. And as the teams get better and better, that should also help with that capital intensity going forward. So I guess the short answer is, it could go up a little bit, but I wouldn't expect a huge change over the next few years."

So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over the cycle, that delivers the most buyer shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020 that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021. 
 
 So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021. We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20, natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to a cost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on that oil -- on the gas side. 
 
 We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus not doing so. As you can imagine, we do a pure put. It's still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type color hedge is going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending one into 2022. A
 
 nd so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge against downturns in the business in the near term. We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And so we have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to kind of continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive in the future."

I mean we've seen that both flexing up and down generally as a pretty good guide for us with that $10 change in commodity price. We see that type of inflation-deflation. It's a little different this time, and you guys are looking at it really closely. Most of the time in the past, changes in oil price correlated with changes in activity. And so this time, as you know, we've seen a pretty strong run-up in commodity price slightly. We haven't seen the correlative activity change that we historically see with that. And so really, when you kind of layer down where a lot of the inflationary pressures come from, it's from changes in activity and the need for resources and so on. 
 
 So this time, looks a little bit different. We're not seeing huge inflationary pressures yet. Of course, there's parts of the market that are driven by housing starts, more than they are, a number of frac crews running and things like that. And so you get little puts and takes. And what we do know and what we see, we have built into the budget. So it wasn't absent of any of that, but it was largely poured on a lower price environment. But we don't expect with what we see at least right now, that number to have to change materially or inflationary reasons. A little early in the year. But at least with what we see right now, we don't expect that to change."

I know on past calls, you haven't really wanted to comment too much beyond 2021 yet, but just anything else you could share there would be interesting."
293286,701179890,2219932,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Yes. I mean, I'd say the same thing. So I mean, the GoM is interesting. And so let me hit on that one first. I mean you see what its capital is this year.

And so let me hit on that one first. I mean you see what its capital is this year. I think it -- yes, if we looked at that over a long period of time, as you know, its capital tends to be a little more lumpy. It comes in bigger chunks than it does in the Permian or DJ because one well doesn't just cost a few million dollars. There's much more that goes with that, and there's tieback costs and things like that. 
 
 So if I was going to characterize the GoM. I mean as you know, our strategy is generally around high-return tiebacks. The teams have been super successful with what they've been doing. And I think Vicki hit on the first 2 wells that they drilled, the Oxy Drilling Dynamics are coming in at cost 35% less than where they were in 2019. So that's really going to help when you look at sustaining capital, and we're having good success delineating new reservoirs around our platforms. So a lot of good things happening there. 
 
 But to explicitly answer your question, if you looked over a 5-year period, I would expect the sustaining capital to be higher than the number that we have this year. It may be a couple of hundred million in a given year higher than what we have this year. But it's -- again, not a huge difference from where we are this year, but probably a bit higher over a 5-year period. 
 
 When you look at the DJ, it's probably similar to what we said on the Permian. Again, the performance improvements are making. I know we talk about this a lot, a lot, but I am astonished at all our businesses and what they're doing. And let's look at the Rockies, you look at their rig release-to-rig release time in the fourth quarter. 
 
 For the 2 rigs they ran, it was 4.3 days. That was 27% better than what it was in 2019, and that's in a restart period. So again, they're doing really, really well. Same thing on our EOR business, one we don't talk a lot about. They pulled over $350 million out of their OpEx last year, and that largely is sustainable this year. 
 
 So you look at those things and all of those kind of benefits are going to flow through to the sustaining capital as we look a few years out. So for DJ, I'd give a very similar answer, and it could be a little bit higher than what we're seeing this year just because of the number of DUCs we brought in this year, but it's not going to be a huge material change. 
 
 So we feel pretty confident with our 2.9%, maybe a little bit higher if you're in a much higher commodity price world for a longer period of time, but we don't see a change in 30%, 40%, that kind of thing. We feel pretty confident about that for the next few years."

With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production",1433,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year of extreme volatility for our industry and the world. With the year now behind us, our operations have returned to a normalized activity level in support of stabilizing our full year production at our fourth quarter 2020 rate. 
 
We entered 2021 with an improved financial position by taking the necessary steps to protect our asset base and derisk our balance sheet. I'm particularly proud of our teams who leveraged our technical expertise to mitigate production decline while relentlessly lowering costs. The capability of our outstanding employees to consistently deliver remarkable results safely was key to our ability to navigate the challenges of the last year as well as the challenges presented by the winter storm last week. 
 
This morning, we'll provide the details of our full year 2021 plan. This plan maintains our best-in-class capital intensity, even with the modest activity increase we started in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also provide an update on our divestiture and deleveraging progress as well as reviewing our financial results and guidance for the year ahead. 
 
Throughout 2020, we focused on maintaining the integrity of our production and asset base as well as lowering overhead and operating costs. Our achievements have positioned us to build on our track record of operational excellence and efficiency gains as we stabilize production in 2021. In the fourth quarter, our businesses continued to outperform and generate momentum for a strong start to this year. We exceeded our production guidance while continuing to deliver lower-than-expected operating costs for the quarter. Our oil and gas operating cost of $6.80 per BOE and domestic operating costs of $6.05 per BOE continue to demonstrate the lasting impact of our cost reduction measures as our domestic operating costs were significantly below our original expectations for the year. 
 
Although our activity slowed in the second and third quarters, our teams did not miss a step as we normalized activity in the fourth quarter. Our onshore domestic assets went from running 22 drilling rigs in the first quarter, down to 0 in the second quarter and then returning to 11 rigs by the end of the year. Operationally, we continue to outperform our expectations and deliver efficiency improvements with new drilling and completion records. Our Texas Delaware and DJ Basin teams demonstrated our consistent drive for efficiency by exceeding our original well cost synergy targets in the quarter, an achievement we're very proud of. 
 
No matter how favorable or challenging the environment in which we operate, we never take our eye off safety. Many of our teams tied or set new safety records last year, while our company-wide performance was our best ever as we simultaneously work to minimize the risk from COVID. 
 
We transitioned into 2021 with an improved financial position, having achieved our divestiture target for 2020. We closed approximately $2.8 billion of asset sales, $2.4 billion of which closed in the fourth quarter. In 2020, we utilized the divestiture proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt and liabilities by approximately $2.4 billion and $300 million, respectively. 
 
We also completed a successful refinancing program, extending approximately $7 billion of debt maturities. Together, these achievements place us in a strong position for the year ahead, so we can focus on reducing debt and improving our business while maximizing the value of our unmatched asset base. 
 
The progress we made last year in reducing operating costs will continue into 2021 as the synergies we delivered and the vast majority of our additional cost savings remain in place. These savings are now embedded in our ongoing operations. We expect to deliver overhead of $1.8 billion, which represents full retention of all synergies and a significant portion of our additional cost reductions. We'll continuously seek new opportunities to lower costs and expand margins as we move forward. We expect to spend $2.9 billion of capital in 2021 to sustain our production at our fourth quarter production rate. 
 
Our plans are based on a $40 WTI price environment, and we are prepared to flex spending lower, if necessary. If oil prices continue to improve this year, we will not increase capital in support of production growth. The flexibility and optionality that our scale and asset base provide are often underappreciated. We are equipped to adjust to future potential commodity price dips or regulatory changes while being positioned to leverage the benefits of future price uplift. Likewise, our capital and spending plans retain a high degree of flexibility, allowing us to adapt to a changing macro environment. 
 
The level of capital spending required in 2021 to sustain our production demonstrates our ability to deliver best-in-class capital intensity even in a period where we are not growing production. Leveraging our technical expertise, particularly in subsurface characterization, enables us to drill the best wells while we continue to pursue new ways to lower costs with the goal of spending less to produce more barrels. The efficiency of our capital development, coupled with our low base decline and our relentless pursuit of maximizing every barrel from our existing wells, allows us to hold our production flat with capital of $2.9 billion in 2021. 
 
We are pleased with the progress achieved to date in closing divestitures and reducing debt, especially given the challenging market in 2020. We exceeded our $2 billion divestiture target with the closing of the mineral and surface acreage in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah as well as our onshore assets in Colombia. Post Colombia, we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of asset sales to be announced by mid-2021. We are making progress towards this new target and have already closed approximately $350 million of transactions. 
 
As we near the end of our large-scale divestiture program, we will continue to balance transaction timing with price realization. We'll not sacrifice value to close transactions quickly. As commodity prices continue to strengthen, we expect the value that buyers place on assets to adjust accordingly. We will always prioritize obtaining value for our shareholders over meeting a deadline or divestiture target, which we've imposed upon ourselves. 
 
As Rob will speak to you in a moment, our debt reduction efforts, combined with our ability to refinance $7 billion of near-term maturities over the last year, places us in a favorable position. We continuously review our portfolio to ensure we have the optimal mix of free cash flow generation, capital efficiency and low decline assets. We now have one of the best portfolios in Oxy's 100-year history, but this doesn't mean that we have stopped looking for opportunities to improve our asset base. 
 
We frequently complete acreage trades to core up positions in operatorship, and on occasion, may pursue opportunities where we see outstanding value with a bolt-on acquisition. For example, we recently exercised a preferential right to increase our working interest in the Lucius project, which we operate in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect that our investment will pay back in slightly over a year in a $40 oil price environment. 
 
Our oil and gas highlights slides includes just a few of the many achievements our business delivered in the fourth quarter. Even during a period of increasing activity, we continue to improve uptime and reduce time to market by lowering drilling and completion times. This includes our Gulf of Mexico operations, who beat their previous spud to first production record by 3 days. 
 
Additionally, we'll continue to push the envelope on driving out cost and achieved our original capital synergies for well cost savings in the Texas Delaware and DJ Basin, almost 1 year ahead of schedule. And we are pleased to have been awarded a new concession, onshore Block 5 in Abu Dhabi, which is adjacent to onshore Block 3 where we've been conducting exploration work. Following the award of Block 5, we made a multi-reservoir discovery in Block 3. We still have more exploration and appraisal work to complete, but are highly encouraged by the results to date. 
 
Last year, we communicated a revised framework for excess cash flow, which prioritizes maintaining our low-cost production base, reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. Our cash flow priorities remain unchanged as we do not anticipate growing production for at least this year. Our immediate goal is to continue reducing debt, and with the support of the strengthened balance sheet, return capital in a more meaningful way to our common shareholders. 
 
I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results and guidance for the first quarter and full year ahead."

In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share -- reported diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to an approximate $850 mi",899,"Thank you, Vicki. In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.78 per share and a reported loss of $1.41 per share -- reported diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to an approximate $850 million loss on sales related to the carrying value of assets divested during the quarter. 
 
As Vicki mentioned, our achievements last year contributed to the improved financial position that we have today. And reducing our debt by $2.4 billion and refinancing $7 billion of near-term maturities in 2020, we have significantly derisked our financial profile. This is especially relevant considering we are targeting an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of divestitures post Colombia. 
 
In 2020, we repaid or extended almost $6 billion of 2021 maturities, $2.7 billion in 2022 maturities and more than $260 million of 2023 maturities. This leaves us with less than $375 million of remaining 2021 maturities. We repaid over $9 billion of debt over the last 18 months, lowered outstanding principal to approximately $35 billion. While we were able to adequately manage this level of debt in a mid-cycle environment, our focus remains on debt reduction and strengthen the balance sheet to provide stability throughout the cycle. 
 
As we guided our fourth quarter, capital spending increase from the third quarter to support normalized activity levels ahead of 2021. Even as activity levels increased in the fourth quarter and we returned to paying preferred dividend in cash, we still generated approximately $800 million of free cash flow, driven by the strong operational performance of our businesses and our focus on improving margins. We entered 2021 with $2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. 
 
We are pleased with our progress on increasing our share price since our last earnings call. Our shares have traded above the $22 strike price of the warrants we issued last year. And the shares trade above the warrant strike price, warrant holders gain the right but not the obligation to exercise those warrants and purchase Oxy shares for $22. As of January 31, approximately 12,000 warrants have been exercised, resulting in about 12,000 [ new leased ] shares. As additional warrants are exercised, we allocate the resulting cash proceeds to debt reduction. 
 
We are beginning to benefit from the activity added in the fourth quarter. As there's often a lag between the change in activity and resulting impact on production, we expect our fourth quarter production to be slightly lower sequentially when compared to our fourth quarter of 2022 -- 2020. The expected production decline in the first quarter is due to the timing lag in adding activity as well as the impact of the recent storm on our operations and turnaround activity at Al Hosn in Tulsa. 
 
Our first quarter Permian guidance includes a 25,000 BOE per day impact in the unprecedented weather event in Texas last week. Although the storm had a meaningful impact on our Permian production, we expect the impact to be temporary as our operations recovered quickly. While our ultimate ability to recover barrels lost during the winter storm will determine if we were able to reach precisely our full year guidance, we anticipate the full year production will be essentially equivalent to our fourth quarter rate, excluding Colombia. 
 
Going forward, we have combined Permian Resources and EOR into single Permian entity as it relates to providing guidance and reporting results. As we further integrate our Permian operations and low-carbon strategy in oil and gas, we anticipate increased opportunities in sharing of resources. We are also guiding the Gulf of Mexico separately to provide additional clarity on seasonal production variances as we encounter by this asset. 
 
Our focus continues to be improving items we can influence, such as growing our cash margin through operational improvement and lowering expenses. We recognize there are certain noncash items that we have less influence over and forecast an increase in non cap expenses this year. On a per barrel basis, we expect DD&A will rise due to higher completion rates as reserve decreased during the year. When we issue our 10-K, we would disclose the lower reserve position, reflecting significantly lower commodity price environment during 2020 and activity level lower than we had forecasted at the end of 2019. 
 
Our 2021 capital plan slide provides details by asset and investment. The production and capital guidance we provided for the first quarter and full year take into account the regulatory environment as we understand it today. Our high-quality asset base provides the flexibility to adjust activity and capital allocation as the environment may change. If a significant change to the regulatory environment occurs, we will provide an update to our guidance as warranted. 
 
For the full year, our capital plan includes running 6 rigs in Texas, Delaware, 1 in New Mexico, 4 in the Midland Basin and 2 in the Rockies. The drillship that return to the Gulf of Mexico late last year is expected to remain active throughout 2021. The flexibility embedded in our capital plan, combined with the financial improvements made last year, have placed Occidental in a much stronger position for the years ahead. While we still have work to do to strengthen our balance sheet, we now have the necessary runway to continue optimizing the performance of our assets while improving our financial position. 
 
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

Our low carbon strategy enables Occidental to play a leading role in limiting methane emissions and removing CO2 from the atmosphere while amplifying our existing businesses and benefiting our shareholders. We expect to improve the profitability of enhanced oil recovery in the Permian and in other regions as we reduce the carbon intensity of our own emissions and products. 
 
As we implement our low carbon strategy, we expect to continue working cohesively with regulators under the new administration while demonstrating our commitment to safety and the environment. We expect our operations on federal land to continue and have more than 350 approved permits in New Mexico and approximately 175 in the Powder River Basin with many more pending. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have not experienced any impact to our operations. 
 
Following our last earnings call, we released our 2020 climate report detailing our target of reaching 0 emissions from our own operations by 2040, with an ambition to accomplish this by 2035 and an ambition to be net 0, including the use of our products by 2050. As part of our low carbon strategy, we can provide a solution for partners and other industries as well, such as airlines and utilities. Those industries may not have an alternative means to significantly lower their carbon footprint. 
 
As I've said before, the opportunity before us is immense, and we are ready for the challenge. Thanks to our incredible employees, we can plan through the lens of being a best-in-class, low-cost operator with an exceptional portfolio of assets in tandem with a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and executing our strategy to lead in a low-carbon world. 
 
We'll now open the call for your questions."

And so we're going to stay very committed to making sure that we get the best value for whatever we execute on, but I will say that I have some confidence that we'll get there because of the fact that we have multiple opportunities. 
 
We're not depending on just 1 or 2 possible divestitures we have in our portfolio. It's so large, so diverse. We have multiple options to choose from. So I do believe that we could get to the upper end, but it's more likely that we would target the lower end, and the timing of the lower end really depends on how quickly we can get the offers to where we need them to be. And again, we have a couple of processes in place right now and then the -- some things on hold. So it's all about value for us and getting to that number.

I would say it's not -- the way we're doing our strategy is not a necessity that we do it in association with our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian, but we believe that's the best way to do it and the best value proposition for our shareholders. So that's what we focused on initially. 
 
And if I could just point you to -- as I talk about the production cycle, point you to the time line, where it shows how this idea was originally brought up. It was our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects in the Permian. They were the reason that we started this vision, and we started the vision more than 10 years ago. We started the vision well before 2008, where you see on the time line that the original 45Q tax credit was established. 
 
We were a part -- or our government group was a part of helping to get 45Q tax credit approved and put in place. And so back then, what we started looking at was how to maximize the vast resources that we had already in conventional reservoirs that were conducive to CO2 enhanced oil recovery. So that started the process back then. What we wanted to do is we wanted to come up with a way to have a lower cost, long term, no decline supply of CO2, and that's why we came up with the anthropogenic CO2 auction. 
 
So you see in 2010, it's when our century CO2 plant came on, and it's capturing CO2 delivering it to our Denver unit in West Texas. And the Denver unit MRV plan, you can see we got approved in 2015. The Denver unit is one of our largest CO2 projects. We are continuing to add reserves to it even today. It's massive. And so that and in addition to the hubs MRV plan that we got in 2017, it's important to note that we were the company that got the first 2 permits ever issued by the EPA for the sequestration and capture of CO2 in the reservoir. 
 
And the MRV is, it means monitoring, reporting and verification. It's just a plan that ensures that you -- when you put the CO2 on the ground, you have properly sequestered it. So we got the first 2 of those. And that whole process, as we started getting that done, was to try to take advantage of the more than a billion barrels of resources that we have left to develop in our current holdings and conventional reservoirs in the Permian. And as you know, the Permian is so vast, we have lots of ability to expand way beyond that. 
 
And I know you didn't ask the rest of this question, but I do want to talk about what started as a vision to improve our cost structure and extend our ability to develop even more resources in the EOR business. It's now turned into more than that. It's turned into an ability for us to create a new business, a new business that not only will add additional value for our shareholders over time, but reduces emissions in the world. 
 
And it helps -- we'll be the leaders in helping to test technology, the direct air capture technology, put it in place, make it operational and commercial, and that will be -- will provide an opportunity for others to expand it in the world. 
 
And so moving to what that does beyond our enhanced oil recovery in the Permian, you have to look at some of the things that are a part of what we're doing. In 2018, another thing that was critical for us was when 45Q was expanded. And when we -- when it was expanded and approved by Congress, it enabled us to make this commercial, the first direct air capture and carbon capture from industry commercial. So that was an important step. 
 
Then we established our Low Carbon Ventures group. We joined the oil and gas climate initiative. We teamed up with White Energy to capture CO2 from their project. We did some other things around emissions, too. We announced our Goldsmith Solar project, and 2 other things that we did is we invested in NET Power in 2018. 
 
NET Power is a technology that will generate electricity at a lower cost than a typical power plant and with the opportunity to capture the CO2 as a part of the process so that we can sequester it in our oil reservoirs. And then the start of 2019, we invested in carbon engineering, and carbon engineering has the technology that we will use as a part of our direct air capture process to pull CO2 from the air into -- but then sequester it in our oil reservoirs. 
 
And you can see through there, there are other things that we continue to do over time that's led us to where we are today. There is -- won't go through and read all of those, but there's a lot that's been done. And the foundation has been very meticulously planned and staged, and now the foundation is set for us to finish some of the processes that we have and discussions that we have in place today to get to a point where this really becomes a business that has 3 ways of benefiting us and benefits the world. And so without going through and reading the rest of that, I'll go ahead and stop here and let you answer or ask your follow-up."

Worley is -- they're an incredible company. They're -- they have also a passion around carbon capture and around doing the things that they need to do to also become carbon neutral. And I want to point out in all the partnerships that we've developed so far, all the partnerships have been with people who share our vision and our commitment that this is -- has to create value for our shareholders, but it's also the right thing to do for our operations and for the world. 
 
All of these guys share the same thing. United Airlines, who is partnering with us, too, to build this direct air capture, they all share the same vision that we do. They're committed to become carbon-neutral. So selecting Worley and having them on board with the commitment that they have and to get the FEED study done, that's going to be a significant milestone for us. And we're hoping to get that done by 2022. And then the construction beyond that would take about 18 months to 2 years, but we're very confident in the -- that the technology will work because every part of the direct air capture is being used in some way somewhere. 
 
And as I think I said on the last earnings call, one of the key things that's needed in there as a part of it is that potassium hydroxide, which we use a lot of anyway. And so we're familiar with what we need to use. We're familiar with the pieces and parts, and I have confidence that our team in working with Worley to work out the details. 
 
We'll do the same thing that we've been able to do in Al Hosn where that was a very complex facility that we built there. And I know I belabored this probably too much, but that was incredibly impressive to build a facility out in the middle of the desert that's that huge, and the sulfur recovery units that are a part of Al Hosn were very, very unique and different. 
 
And I don't think there are any that are that large in anywhere else in the world. But we working with our partners, ADNOC, we're able to make that work right off the bat without any kind of glitch. And not only made it work, so we were able to expand it by 30% with just an incremental $10 million off of the $10 billion that it took to build it. 
 
So our major projects team knows how to build things. Worley is very, very experienced and knowledgeable. I think between the 2 of us, our team and them, I think we have a great chance to build with this first one. And the first one is always more costly than the next ones to come because we -- you learn a lot from it. But I believe we'll learn a lot from building this first one and making it as efficient as we can be. And then learning as we get it online, how to make it even more efficient."

I mean, even though you start deferred equity, from our standpoint, it's no different than the debt. So maybe that you can elaborate a little bit of the thinking. 
 
Secondly, back on your Page 15, I think you gave some data about the Permian, 11 rigs that you're going to run and the number of wells. And since that that's including the yield out now, so can you break it down, the number of rigs that is related to the unconventional and the number of wells that you're going to come on stream?

And as for trajectory, it's -- I would say it's relatively flat except -- Q1's got a few -- it's not a huge difference, but a little bit fewer wells coming on than you do in Q2, 3 and 4, and that's just because of the ramp-up trajectory. So if you look back, we averaged 2 rigs in the third quarter of '20, 5 rigs in the fourth quarter of '20, and then now we're going to average about 12 rigs in Q1. So when you just think about that trajectory and how the wells online lag that, it makes sense for Q1 to be a little bit lighter, but it's -- there's not a huge difference between those.

As it relates to the Berkshire, so the way the agreement works is that in order to retire principal, we would have to have at least a $4 per share common distribution over a 12-month period to open up paying on a one-for-one basis down on the Berkshire preferred principle. And so certainly, we don't foresee that type of distribution on the common in the near-term future to open it up. To do anything outside of that would require an agreement with Berkshire in order to make a reduction in the actual principle in the near term. It's not that we're not aware of the fact that our ability to source capital is well below the coupon rate today, but we don't have the ability to force that upon the situation as we sit today."

So just first, can you maybe give us an update or a review of your existing pipeline infrastructure and your ability to capture revenue from just the 45Q tax credits and sequestering carbon? 
 
And sort of as we think about it, I think you've made comments, Vicki, about revenue from your carbon business matching your oil business in a couple of decades from now. How big does -- how big of a role is directly our capture versus using your existing infrastructure?"

As you may know, we have the largest infrastructure of any CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the world in the Permian. We have the pipelines that we need to move the CO2 around to wherever we need it to go in -- for our own fields. We also have the gas processing plants and the supporting infrastructure for those plants and the pipelines. So that's why when we think about how to maximize and continue to develop the EOR reserves, that's our preference. 
 
And as I've mentioned in -- when I was going through the time line, the deal that we made with White Energy, they're an ethanol company. So they have 2 plants in the Permian Basin, and they're -- not in the Permian Basin, I'm sorry. They have 2 plants in Texas, and their plants are not too far from a pipeline that will get that CO2 to our infrastructure in the Permian. So that's why we did the deal with them. 
 
We've also teamed up with a cement plant in Colorado to do the same thing, and that plant there will tie into a pipeline that we have coming from Southern Colorado all the way down to the Permian. So we'll be getting CO2 from that plant into the pipeline and to our EOR operations in the Permian. So it's that infrastructure that we're trying to definitely take advantage of. 
 
But the really good thing about the direct air capture and the thing that some people have missed is you can put direct air capture anywhere because you don't need to put it where the pollution is because the winds balance the concentration of CO2 around the world. So what we can do with the direct air capture, put it right close to the facility or the reservoir that we want to put it into. That's why it makes us possible to have direct air capture in the Permian and the DJ, the Powder River, Oman and ultimately -- and hopefully, in Algeria, too. So we can put it anywhere we want. 
 
And this creates opportunities way beyond the Permian. We wanted to prove it up in the Permian because that is the best place for -- almost in the world for enhanced oil recovery. The utilization of the CO2 is best there. And so we've got a good option, good opportunity to maximize our infrastructure. Nobody else has the scale that we do and the size that we do and the opportunity that we have. So we're very, very excited about it. And we do believe that over the next 5 to 10 years that the benefits of our low carbon business will equal our chemical business. And then as you said, ultimately, it's going to be as profitable and deliver as much as our oil and gas business does."

We're going to continue the other partnerships that we consider, the services agreements with others to help them have a place to send their carbon from their facilities, from their plants or industry. But we're -- I'm most excited about the direct air capture because of where we can put it, and the maritime industry, the airline industry, the tech industry. We're having conversations with companies from all of those industries. 
 
And the thing that we really need to have in place and what we're working on, too, is to ensure that we have -- that there is a way and a certified process to track the CO2 molecule from the reservoir to its end use. And as that matures, then we're going to be able to ensure that as we build these partnerships that the partners we have will be able to take full credit for what their investment should provide them while we do the same. But it's all going to be associated with either as anthropogenic from industry or direct air capture. And I believe, over time, direct air capture will be a bigger percentage of what we do."

It's just like solar and wind. I can tell you that I hear the most negative comments from those who have a reason to say that solar and wind are profitable today, a direct air capture never will be. Reality is there's never been a commercial plant built that -- where you can optimize the process like we're going to do. 
 
We do expect -- and as I said earlier, the first plant will be the most expensive, but I don't believe it's going to take very many plants for us to build to get it to the point where it is economical and does not need the credits. Initially, we do need the credit, but we're very close to being in a position to -- for the credits to go away, we believe, because of the fact that we're -- if you couple a direct air capture with an oil reservoir and you don't have to build a pipeline to take it very far, you've already there optimized the cost of the initial build and the ability to get it in place and make it operate. And every component in the direct air capture is working somewhere, so it's a matter of just putting the components together and getting them to be more efficient. 
 
I believe, like any new technology, that the cost definitely will come down. How quickly it will come down, I think, is going to be driven by the expertise, experience, commitment and drive of those working on it. I can tell you our team in Worley, the reason we selected them is because they clearly have a vision on how to make this work, and they're committed to it as our team. And so I have high confidence that over time, and not too long a time but then second or third unit, we're going to have it down to the level where credits are not going to be needed. That's why we're very confident that we can expand this to other areas internationally."

So like the Midland Basin JV, it's very helpful from a capital intensity standpoint. If you look at that, where the 750 carry or through, we've still got a little more than 600 left on that. So that will get us through at least another couple of years from a capital efficiency standpoint. 
 
If you asked us to guess where we're going to be, it's difficult to do that because I wouldn't have expected we'd be as low as where we are today 3 years ago when we were doing this business as the teams continue to get better. 
 
And just as an example, our capital intensity in the resources business will be half this year of what it was 2 years ago. And that's in a year where we're ramping up capital, so usually that works the opposite way. So our teams continue to get better and better. So while I would hate to guess on what that's going to be, it wouldn't surprise me to see it be a little bit higher than a $1.2 billion, 3 or 4 years from now, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful change from that number to hold our Permian Basin flat. 
 
I think you'll get puts and takes. Our decline continues to come down, as you saw the corporate decline going from 25% to 22%. That's largely driven by our improvements in our unconventional businesses, both in Permian resources going from 37% to 33%. Also in the Rockies, that's coming down to about 33%. So I continue to expect that to improve a bit. And as the teams get better and better, that should also help with that capital intensity going forward. So I guess the short answer is, it could go up a little bit, but I wouldn't expect a huge change over the next few years."

So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over the cycle, we feel that delivers the most value to shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020 that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021. 
 
So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021. We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20, natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12/31 with a value between $2.50 and $3.64 on a costless basis, similar to a costless basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on that oil -- on the gas side. 
 
We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus not doing so. As you can imagine, we do a pure put. It's still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type collar hedge is going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today, last year's hedge, extending one into 2022.
 
And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge against downturns in the business in the near term. We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And so we have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to kind of continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive in the future."

I mean we've seen that both flexing up and down generally as a pretty good guide for us with that $10 change in commodity price. We see that type of inflation-deflation. It's a little different this time, and you guys are looking at it really closely. Most of the time in the past, changes in oil price correlated with changes in activity. And so this time, as you know, we've seen a pretty strong run-up in commodity price lately. We haven't seen the correlative activity change that we historically see with that. And so really, when you kind of layer down where a lot of the inflationary pressures come from, it's from changes in activity and the need for resources and so on. 
 
So this time, looks a little bit different. We're not seeing huge inflationary pressures yet. Of course, there's parts of the market that are driven by housing starts more than they are the number of frac crews running and things like that. And so you get little puts and takes. And what we do know and what we see, we have built into the budget. So it wasn't absent of any of that, but it was largely poured on a lower price environment. But we don't expect with what we see at least right now, that number to have to change materially for inflationary reasons. A little early in the year.

And so let me hit on that one first. I mean you see what its capital is this year. I think it -- yes, if we looked at that over a long period of time, as you know, its capital tends to be a little more lumpy. It comes in bigger chunks than it does in the Permian or DJ because one well doesn't just cost a few million dollars. There's much more that goes with that, and there's tieback costs and things like that. 
 
So if I was going to characterize the GoM. I mean as you know, our strategy is generally around high-return tiebacks. The teams have been super successful with what they've been doing. And I think Vicki hit on the first 2 wells that they drilled, the Oxy Drilling Dynamics are coming in at cost 35% less than where they were in 2019. So that's really going to help when you look at sustaining capital, and we're having good success delineating new reservoirs around our platforms. So a lot of good things happening there. 
 
But to explicitly answer your question, if you looked over a 5-year period, I would expect the sustaining capital to be higher than the number that we have this year. It may be a couple of hundred million in a given year higher than what we have this year. But it's, again, not a huge difference from where we are this year, but probably a bit higher over a 5-year period. 
 
When you look at the DJ, it's probably similar to what we said on the Permian. Again, the performance improvements are making -- I know we talk about this a lot, but I am astonished at all our businesses and what they're doing. And let's look at the Rockies, you look at their rig release-to-rig release time in the fourth quarter. 
 
For the 2 rigs they ran, it was 4.3 days. That was 27% better than what it was in 2019, and that's in a restart period. So again, they're doing really, really well. Same thing on our EOR business, one we don't talk a lot about. They pulled over $350 million out of their OpEx last year, and that largely is sustainable this year. 
 
So you look at those things and all of those kind of benefits are going to flow through to the sustaining capital as we look a few years out. So for DJ, I'd give a very similar answer, and it could be a little bit higher than what we're seeing this year just because of the number of DUCs we brought in this year, but it's not going to be a huge material change. 
 
So we feel pretty confident with our 2.9%, maybe a little bit higher if you're in a much higher commodity price world for a longer period of time, but we don't see a change in 30%, 40%, that kind of thing. We feel pretty confident about that for the next few years."

I'd like to start this morning by saying how pleased we are with our first quarter operational and financial performance. The momentum generated by our improved cost structure and capital intensity leadership",1182,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start this morning by saying how pleased we are with our first quarter operational and financial performance. The momentum generated by our improved cost structure and capital intensity leadership was a catalyst for our strong results this quarter and is expected to continue to provide a solid foundation for free cash flow generation. 
This morning, I will cover our first quarter operational performance and divestiture progress. Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our updated guidance, which includes an increase in guidance for midstream and OxyChem's 2021 earnings. 
Our first quarter results are a perfect example of how our ability to consistently deliver strong operational performance has strengthened our financial position. In the first quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, which is our highest level of quarterly free cash flow in a decade. We also closed almost $500 million of divestitures, repaid $174 million of debt and exited the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of unrestricted cash. 
Our plan to stabilize '21 -- 2021 production at our fourth quarter 2020 exit rate is on track. We delivered first quarter production from continuing operations of over 1.1 million BOE per day, with total company-wide capital spending of only $579 million. We're particularly proud of this achievement, given the operational challenge posed by winter storm Uri. 
Our domestic oil and gas operating cost of $7.20 per BOE continued to demonstrate the lasting impact of our cost-reduction measures and includes about $83 million of atypical costs related to the winter storm. I want to note that we have fully recovered from the storm with no lasting impact. 
Even with incurring storm-related costs in the first quarter, our full year domestic operating guidance has only increased by $0.10 per BOE, which represents a significantly smaller increase than the approximate $0.25 per BOE that the $83 million in total OpEx would have otherwise added. This is a significant achievement made possible by our teams continuously seeking efficiencies and finding innovative ways to safely and effectively lower costs. 
In the first quarter, OxyChem benefited from robust PVC pricing and gradual strengthening in the caustic soda market. OxyChem's integration across multiple chlorine derivatives provides us with the ability to optimize our caustic soda production while opportunistically adjusting our production mix to maximize margins. 
OxyChem's ability to adjust to rapidly changing market dynamics was invaluable during the downturn last year. We were able to provide critical products to the medical, pharmaceutical and disinfection markets to respond to COVID. Given the recent improvements in the chlorovinyl and caustic soda markets, we expect OxyChem to extend its track record as a market leader and consistent generator of free cash flow. 
Additionally, during winter storm Uri, our team was able to safely protect our assets as well as provide essential products to our customers. Our team's effective response limited the storm's impact on facility maintenance cost to an immaterial amount. 
Midstream and marketing's outperformance compared to guidance in the first quarter was primarily driven by our ability to optimize long-haul gas transportation in the Rockies, along with the timing impact of export sales. Following the increase in activity in the fourth quarter, our oil and gas business continued to push the envelope with new efficiency gains as we seamlessly transitioned into the first quarter. 
Our Permian teams outperformed expectations in the first quarter by setting new drilling records in New Mexico, the Texas Delaware and the Midland Basin while also driving down costs. Our first quarter Permian achievements are especially impressive as we have now augmented the efficiency of our Oxy Drilling Dynamics with remote directional drilling, an exciting innovation that allows the drill bit to be steered from a separate location. Being able to control and optimize our operations remotely and instantaneously apply shared expertise to similar activities has numerous advantages that we expect our operations to benefit from in the future. 
We also continue to achieve significant efficiency improvements in the Rockies, where in the first quarter, our DJ drilling team reached our lowest average cost per foot in program history. I'd also like to highlight Oman for their best-ever HES performance with no recordables in the first quarter while drilling the longest laterals in Oxy Oman history and achieving record drilling times. 
After a pause of the issuance of new drilling permits on federal land earlier this year, we have now started to see the process move forward again with the approval of new permits. We currently do not expect the permitting process to have an impact on our activity levels as we still plan to run an average of 11 rigs in the Permian this year and 2 in the Rockies. 
In late April, I testified before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in support of lifting the federal leasing moratorium. As I told the committee, continued onshore oil and gas development means high-paying jobs, community reinvestment and meeting energy and product needs during the transition to a low-carbon economy. We look forward to working with Congress and the administration on ways to create clarity and short- and long-term regulatory certainty. 
After we announced the sale of our Colombia onshore assets last year, we updated our divestiture plan to sell $2 billion to $3 billion of assets by the middle of this year. Our progress towards this target continues as we closed almost $500 million of sales in the first quarter. Post Colombia, we now have closed approximately $835 million of divestitures and are well on our way to achieving our target. But we will continue to make the best value decisions by weighing the impact of future cash flows in our current environment versus the benefits of meeting a deadline or divestiture target. 
Looking back over the last year, I'm particularly proud of the accomplishments our teams have achieved and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Not only have we optimized our portfolio, improved our balance sheet and continued to reduce costs, we've also created the pathway to achieve net 0 emissions. As we take our next steps toward achieving our future goals, including further balance sheet improvement, returning additional capital to shareholders and bringing our first commercial scale direct air capture plant online, we will continue to maintain our low-cost, capital efficient, stable production base with a goal of maximizing free cash flow generation through capital discipline and margin preservation. 
Our cash flow priorities are structured with the aim of positioning our company for future success. While we are encouraged by the improving macro environment and are especially proud of our team's ability to maintain and sustain our production base, we will continue to improve our balance sheet until we reach the point where our financial position will support a more meaningful return on capital and return of capital to our shareholders throughout the commodity cycle. 
I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the first quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our cash flow priorities illustrate the importance we continue to place on capital discipline, free cash flow generation and balance sheet improvement. As yo",817,"Thank you, Vicki. I want to echo Vicki's comments on our strong performance in the first quarter. Our cash flow priorities illustrate the importance we continue to place on capital discipline, free cash flow generation and balance sheet improvement. As you look ahead on the steps necessary to transition from our current to our medium-term cash flow priorities, our focus on balance sheet improvement will continue to influence our financial policies. 
Throughout 2020, which was one of the worst years our industry has endured, we focused on deleveraging and continue to reduce debt in the first quarter of this year. We repaid approximately $9.6 billion of principal since August of 2019, with more to come as we can complete our divestiture program combined with leveraging our ability to rate excess free cash flow and maintain our commitment to capital discipline. 
On past calls, I've highlighted our preference for a viable path to return to investment-grade and credit rating. We're allocating excess cash flow to our medium-term priorities. While credit ratings are based on several factors, including a certain level of debt, returning to investment-grade in a mid-cycle commodity price environment may include reducing debt to the mid-$20 billion range. We are not there here today, but we believe this goal is achievable, given our potential to generate free cash flow. 
We repaid $174 million of debt in the first quarter and now have less than $225 million of maturities due the remainder of 2021. If we generate cash from organic free cash flow and close our remaining divestitures, we have some more options available to deploy that cash, improve our balance sheet. We have the option to call the 2022 floating rate notes prior to maturity and may at times allow our cash cushion to build until maturities come due. 
We have additional options available to address future maturities, which we are currently evaluating. We may also consider retiring $750 million of notional interest rate swaps later this year for the fair value amount, which was approximately $665 million at quarter end. This would improve cash flows by almost $50 million per annum at the current curve. 
In the first quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.15 per share and a reported loss of $0.36 per share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to a gain on asset sales and positive fair value adjustments, offset by planned lease expiries and a legal contingency related to our 2016 settlement with Ecuador. 
This quarter, we classified all derivative instruments of mark-to-market adjustments as items affecting the clearability. We expect this change will be helpful to investors comparing underlying business performance between periods and reconciling actual results to our guidance, which had previously excluded the mark-to-market adjustment. 
We were able to add additional gas hedges in the quarter and have now hedged approximately half of our 2021 domestic natural gas production with a floor of $2.50 per Mcf. We are on track to spend within our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion, having incurred capital expenditures of only $579 million in the first quarter. 
Our operational success, combined with our focus on sustaining production in a more supportive commodity price environment, enabled us to generate $1.6 billion in free cash flow and exit the quarter with almost $2.3 billion on restricted cash in hand. Our business incurred a negative working capital change in the quarter, which was largely driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to the commodity price recovery. Over half of the working capital change was due to commodity price, which reflects the timing difference between whatever it is recognized and when the cash is received. 
We also made several payments that are typical in the first quarter, including property taxes, cash interest payments, employee benefit payments and pension contributions. We see the potential for the working capital change to partially reverse over the remainder of this year as expenses are accrued last year are already paid in the first quarter of this year. 
We are pleased to be able to update our full year guidance for midstream and OxyChem, reflecting strong first quarter performance and improved market conditions. Our revised guidance, combined with our operational achievements, have enabled us to lower our 2021 breakeven to the mid-$30 range on a WTI basis before the preferred dividend. 
I would like to reiterate that despite the first quarter weather impact to our Permian production of approximately 25,000 BOE per day as guided on our last call, combined with the production impact associated with divesting $282 million -- $285 million of minerals and a negative PSC impact of over 5,000 BOE per day related to higher oil prices, our full year production guidance of 1.14 million BOEs per day remains intact as does our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion. 
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

We understand that many of our stakeholders have a desire to learn more about our low-carbon projects and the returns these projects will generate. 
While we are not yet able to share the economics, we will have created partnerships to finance and deploy cutting-edge CCUS technology, which leverages our expertise and our tens of billions of dollars worth of CO2 infrastructure assets and floor space. We are creating these cross-industry opportunities for others to invest alongside us to maximize the deployment pace and carbon removal impact. We look forward to sharing more information when possible. 
As part of being a socially and environmentally responsible operator, we consistently make operational improvements in addition to working toward our net 0 goals. In the first quarter, we started a water recycling facility in the Midland Basin and began utilizing recycled water in our South Curtis Ranch development. In partnership with an industry-leading water midstream company, we were able to increase our water recycling efforts and lower costs. Recycling water has been a large focus of ours in New Mexico for several years, and we are pleased to have been able to expand this effort into Texas. 
Before we begin the Q&A, I want to announce that in April, we became the first U.S. oil and gas company to commit to adopting the World Economic Forum's stakeholder capitalism metrics. This commitment will guide our process to incorporate the forum's metrics most relevant to our business into our environmental, social and governance reporting. We believe this is the appropriate framework to supplement our reporting on ESG progress, enhance transparency and strengthen our engagement with investors and other stakeholders.

So our revised guidance, when you combine in operational achievements, did lower our breakeven, what was say the mid-$30 range on a WTI basis before the preferred dividend. Specifically, we give a range because it is influenced by a number of factors that you listed, including the cash flows, including the natural gas prices, realization for our products, investiture timing and where chemicals and midstream falls in respect of earnings guidance. And obviously, this quarter, we were able to significantly improve our guidance on both the chemicals and midstream business, which has a material impact on that range. 
In addition to that, as we take that organic cash flow and we can further improve the breakeven and doing things like I mentioned in my opening comments regarding interest rate swaps, where we retired the $665 million of notional value or $750 million notional value, that was $665 million at the end of the quarter, we're able to eliminate about $50 million of interest costs for the year using the current curve. So there's a lot of things that go into that. 
In terms of forecasting out cash flow end of the year, we don't forecast cash flow forward on that side of it. I think you can see pretty representative quarter. It's a fairly clean quarter outside of a few things. And I think you can see -- illuminate the working capital and get an idea what kind of cash we would generate at similar prices moving forward."

But it's helpful to -- when we can to generate some cash as we're building the facility. That's what that request was about. And if we could get that request, what that enables us to do is accelerate development of the next facility. 
So what we're trying to do is what I believe the CARB and others want to do. And that is accelerate our ability to be able to have a positive impact on the environment and also to be able to create value for our shareholders. 
We're trying to accelerate that where we can. And so we believe that we will be able to provide or obtain some funds either from that or potentially from some modifications that we think is critically important to 45Q because currently 45Q is a tax credit. If that were a direct pay to us for the carbon that we capture, that's another enabler that allows us to accelerate the construction of the technology, get that advanced faster and more built sooner. So there, we're looking at multiple ways to accelerate all that we're doing in the Permian with respect to direct air capture."

That",406,"I think the changes that will come out will not impact current leases. I do believe that we'll be able to continue permitting on current leases. My concern is that there could be a moratorium, a longer-term moratorium on picking up additional leases. That would be bad for our industry. It would be bad for the United States. It would put our country in a position where we would likely have an even tougher time increasing production above where the United States is today. 
As you know, we were at one point over 13 million barrels a day of oil production from the U.S. That's a scenario that gave us strength in world politics. It gave us the ability to completely supply our own oil and products domestically. We would not have to import very much at all at a 13 million barrel a day level because I believe our refining capacity is somewhere near 17 million. So we would have some capability to be almost completely independent. 
With a moratorium on federal leases, that would really drive down our industry's ability to react. Now where we are in that, we've got 9.5 million acres of -- to develop in the U.S. And of that 9.5 million acres, I think only about 1.6 million are federal, and about half of that is offshore. So from a new lease standpoint, there are some companies that are in better positions than others, and we believe we are. 
But what I'm advocating for is the industry and for the country because the other thing about this is some of this is being touted as a way to reduce emissions for the United States, which would be definitely a bad move because we are very prudent with what we're doing in the United States compared to a lot of countries around the world. We've reduced emissions significantly in the U.S. and continue to push technologies to further reduce. 
API, we're part of API, and a lot of companies within API have committed to a voluntary partnership where we're all working to share technologies then to help each other reduce emissions and to get the best available technology in place to address emissions and climate change. So I think that, for me, the biggest worry is not on existing leases. It's just the moratorium could be extended for a long time on picking out or anybody picking up any new releases."

And as we have mentioned before, we started working on this low-carbon strategy because we wanted a more sustainable source for CO2 and a lower-cost CO2 for our enhanc",666,"No. Our low-carbon strategy is very connected to our CO2 enhanced or recovery projects. And as we have mentioned before, we started working on this low-carbon strategy because we wanted a more sustainable source for CO2 and a lower-cost CO2 for our enhanced oil recovery. 
Where we're positioned today is incredibly exciting because in the Permian Basin, we have such a footprint of not only reservoirs, floor space and resources, we have the processing plants. We have the pipelines and all of that necessary to further accelerate development of additional 2 billion barrels in our conventional reservoirs. And this, we haven't even been able to calculate yet what we could get from CO2 enhanced oil recovery in the shale. 
But doing that in the Permian, doing that in the DJ Basin and the Powder River, that sets us up for decades to come of generating new reserves and production from existing reservoirs. And so really, it's tied to that. It's tied to being able to create value for our shareholders through the extended production of more reserves than what can typically be produced out of conventional or unconventional resources. 
For example, in conventional reservoirs, with CO2, you can get up to 70% or better recovery. And whereas it was just primary development, normally, you get 20% to 25% at most. So we can get better than 70% with CO2 flooding. In the unconventional where most companies will tell you that you'll get at most 10% to 12% recovery of the hydrocarbons from the shale play, but with CO2 enhanced oil recovery, we've tested it. We've run 4 pilots, and we now know that we can potentially get 75% additional recovery or maybe even double it. 
So we're sitting in a position now where we have a significant amount of future potential development. And we have it in the areas where we operate, the areas where we already have the infrastructure. So as we go forward, our incremental production and recoveries are just going to continue to be at lower and lower cost beyond the point where we were able to get these direct air capture facilities built. 
But what's also going to help us there, too, and help further lower cost is executing on our NET Power technology, which we're also an equity investor in. NET Power is the process that generates a lower cost of electricity by combusting hydrocarbons with oxygen, and it therefore spits off a pure stream of CO2 that -- and no other emissions. So we can take that CO2 and use it in our reservoirs. So it's essentially a lower-cost, emission-free electrical generation process for us. 
So we have a lot of ways as we go forward, and this is why we're incredibly excited, a lot of ways to get more oil out of the ground for lower cost. And so as we go forward, our cost structure will continue to decrease, not just from the debt reduction that Rob has talked about, but from the actual development and operations in the field. 
And in addition to that, we will be able to provide aviation and maritime industries with a net carbon 0 oil. So we're going to be the solution for actually aviation and maritime, and that's why United wanted to join with us on building this first direct air capture facility. So it's exciting for us. 
Sorry, if I'm talking too long on this. I'll stop here and see if you have anything else to ask, but it's exciting for us. And we're really looking forward to being able to talk more about this. And as I said in my script, we can't yet because we're in the middle of some processes and some discussions and interactions with others. But we hope that in the fall or close to the end of the year, we will be able to share more about it and get you a model that you'll be able to see and understand at that point."

So it's a value proposition for us. And it's also ensuring that -- the other part of the consideration is making sure that we have enough cash flow to meet our maturities, debt maturities and even to go beyond that to, as Rob was saying, to deal with the interest rate swaps and some other minor costs that we have.

So if you look at a typical first quarter, we historically see a somewhat of a significant draw in the first quarter because of the -- but it was certainly more sizable in the first quarter of this year. When y",389,"Yes. Sure, Neil. Happy to do that for you. So if you look at a typical first quarter, we historically see a somewhat of a significant draw in the first quarter because of the -- but it was certainly more sizable in the first quarter of this year. 
When you go back to 2018, Q1 withdraw about $700 million. In 2019, it was about $900 million. For the opposite reasons of this quarter, 2020 was about $200 million draw because we price going the opposite direction, obviously, in March when the pandemic hit and with the price wars going on. So regardless of the $1.3 billion draw we experienced in the first quarter does and is exceptionally large. The majority of that was driven by the change in commodity prices. It was the timing difference between revenue recognition and cash received. 
So at the end of 2020, WTI was about $48 a barrel, and it was $61 a barrel at the end of March. And so this price increase impacts both our AR balances and our inventory significantly, especially when you consider our midstream business and how many barrels are on the water at any given point in time. And even that's a bit exacerbated because we discussed a bit last time that Europe essentially has been shut down the significant cargoes of oil from the Gulf since the third quarter of last year. And as a result, we've had to change our mix or portfolio of export shipments, which are now, for the most part, heavily weighted to -- it's not exclusively related to shipments to Asia, which is longer voyages, more crude on the water longer because of the transit times. 
And then obviously, compared to other years, we have a pretty modest capital budget. And so we're not creating the significant amount of payables or capital spending. And so when you look at it, a combination of the price impacts, coupled with all those first quarter events like the interest payments, the payments for property tax as we made a significant contribution to the ABC pension plan during the first quarter, and then -- so we put it all together, we do expect as you pointed out, as receivables start to come in that some of that will reverse the top of the year goes on."

So absolutely, nothing I'm happy to do than talk about our chemical business, which had an excellent start to the year. When you look at the chemical business, it has both some impacts from winter storm Uri, to some extent, but also because how winte",599,"Yes. So absolutely, nothing I'm happy to do than talk about our chemical business, which had an excellent start to the year. When you look at the chemical business, it has both some impacts from winter storm Uri, to some extent, but also because how winter storm Uri impacted the overall business itself. 
And so  production struggled significantly in March post storm. If you think about Uri, it had a much wider impact than an individual hurricane had in the past. And so you still have a lot of inspections, et cetera, going on and restarts going in the month of March. And that has extended into after a very difficult hurricane season last year. And so going into the end of 2020, we already had a pretty tight supply-demand balance in the second half of the year. And that was coupled with a pretty significant amount of damage, though building products are in very high demand right now. So our PVC demand and margins were significant already going into the year. 
And so if you look at our operating rates as the industry, they're only about 71.5% for the first quarter of '21, whereas last year, they were 89%. And so the combination of the stronger demand, coupled with the production off-line to start the year, has already tightened up an already tight supply demand balance. 
And so in the case of PVC, construction investment is very strong. Demand is expected to range strong, with the housing starts outlook, low mortgage rates, a lot of emphasis on remodeling, et cetera, right now that is driving PVC demand. So PVC demand domestically is up almost 5% compared to the same period in 2020, which drives down the amount of PVC that's actually being exported. And exports were actually down about 30% compared to the same period last year. 
And so with resin tight in the domestic market, we're able to expand margins just like we would in our commodity supply-demand balance. And then what we're seeing in the caustic soda business is whereas previously when we guided, we anticipated to start -- we're seeing caustic soda bottom, and we thought we would start to see improvements in the second half of the year, Uri has pulled that forward a bit. And so now we're seeing caustic soda prices improve in the second quarter as we move forward. So we're just getting more of that as the year goes on. And so we're expecting not only continued high margins in the PVC business and Brazilian demand through the balance of the year as construction continues to pull. I mean, PVC's different. We're seeing prices of wood and everything else. We'll also see caustic soda benefit from that process at all. 
And as Vicki mentioned, Oxy's a significant amount of other derivatives beyond just PVC that we sell gives the company a lot more variability in the molecules that it can sell, produce additional caustic soda and produce additional value in other parts of the chlorine chain, which is going to expand our ability to increase the value delivered by the business. I just -- it's the reason why we talk about how much value is locked in the chemical business and why when people talk to us about the chemical business a lot of times and why we don't see something different with it is because it's just hard for people to grasp with a small commodity chemical business that can turn out these types of cash flow on this asset base. And it's really -- it's a remarkable business."

So getting down to the mid-$20 billion range on gross debt, that's where you think you need to be to hit IG status at mid-cycle prices. And I think ultimately, that's an important goal for you all. So about $10 billion more to go from there. Can you just remind us what your view of mid-cycle prices are at this point? And how does this jive with your prior target of 3x leverage as the trigger for growth, which I think was also at mid-cycle prices?"

They're not -- so they don't move their price decks with the current environment of being in the mid- to low 60s. And so that makes a significant difference on where that breakeven location is at. 
So is it exactly 20 -- $10 billion, right? Obviously, there's a lot of different things that factor as indicated in my remarks, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of that. It's somewhere -- other things will go into that. It could mitigate it to be a little higher than that would be possible or even a little lower than that. But obviously, there's a lot of things to go into it, but it's somewhere in that range. 
So even though that you can probably move forward and get pretty close to that or [ low ] that 3x in your model for the second half of the year. By the end of the year, based on oil prices were to continue, it's not that price deck that we're going to be considered for investment-grade."

We've got the preferred, but you do have like very healthy oil prices as well as asset sales that are coming in. So I'm just kind of wondering when we're looking at our free cash flow profile and the new debt targets when we can kind of revisit the growth conversation versus the dividend and paying off other things?"

So Jeanine, I would say that, obviously, as with Vicki's remarks, we're squarely focused on the leverage reduction right now and looking at the opportunity to get down to that investment-grade type level. Embodied in that is going to be using the proceeds, both from the free cash flow from the business, using the proceeds of the divestitures that take place and combine those 2 things together to reduce the cost -- what we have outstanding. And that can be through a host of different things, as I discussed on remarks, between what we're evaluating near term on the ability to put that cash to work to reduce debt. 
That conversation will eventually rotate over into medium-term priorities, focusing on the dividend. But we haven't established a policy on what the dividend might look like. It's going to need to be sustainable, as we've indicated in our priorities. So it could be a combination of something that's fixed and some variable component. 
We haven't decided on that at this point. But that conversation will come at the -- after we made more progress on our debt reduction."

You had said that you were able to identify some cost-reduction opportunities in the quarter that offset some of the winter storm impacts. I was wondering if you could comment just whether that was deferrals or more structural reductions? 
And then as part of that, as you think about the margin expansion opportunities going forward, are you still identifying things like upside the contribution of the Anadarko transaction? Or maybe said another way, is there still more room to run on reducing the cost structure here? And what are some of the levers to drive that cost structure down?"

There's more opportunities to continue to reduce our cost structure in both capital and OpEx. And one example I'll give is we went back recently and took a look at our drilling performance between 2015 up through what we're doing in 202",718,"Yes, you're right. There's more opportunities to continue to reduce our cost structure in both capital and OpEx. And one example I'll give is we went back recently and took a look at our drilling performance between 2015 up through what we're doing in 2021. And I can tell you, we rolled out our physics and logistics space, Oxy Drilling Dynamics in our domestic operations in 2015 and then rolled it out internationally in late 2016. 
And I think I said before, we haven't seen an area where we've rolled this out that we haven't had about a 20% to 30% reduction in our cost. And the exciting thing in looking at our data today is we've decreased our drilling cost from $200 a foot back in 2015 to $135 a foot in 2021 for our global drilling. That's everything around the world. 
And so we've individually pointed out the performance improvements in the Permian, but we've not only seen it in the Permian. We've seen it in the DJ, in the Powder River. And now Oman is seeing a lot of good things happening there by using this process, and it's proprietary to us. We developed it. 
So it's making a difference. We've also started deploying it to the Gulf of Mexico and seeing some good things there that we'll be able to quantify and report on here in the near future. 
So it's drilling. On the drilling side, it's still -- and I will say before I leave drilling, some people might say that you probably got all that. And right now, we're not improving. From 2019 to 2020, even in the downturn, we improved by 14% what we were doing there. So there's -- the improvement is happening even today. So far this year, we've improved by about 4% only 1 quarter into it. This is as we were picking up rigs. 
So this is -- what we're doing there is working. But also on the completion side, we're still setting records for how many fracs we can do in a 24-hour period, and so that's improving. 
The other thing we're seeing is that our Permian team, the -- every one of them actually is continuing to work on the subsurface model. And this has been a point of extreme emphasis for us because of the variation in the shale play. So we started really enhancing our subsurface expertise about 6 or 7 years ago and working hard to get that to where we needed it to be. 
We have some incredible people in-house that now do that work. And that -- what we've learned in the shale play, we've extended also to looking at conventional and to doing more with seismic. And part of that was driven by the good efforts that the Anadarko staff had accomplished and achieved with some of the 3D seismic. And our team, some of our domestic people started looking at how others were doing things and taking what others are doing and made it better. 
So every phase of what we're doing, we're trying to do better. And we're seeing still continuing improvement. Oman is using what they call an Oxy jetting system where in existing wells, they can go in and jet with a process that ensures maximum contact with the reservoir through each phase of the jetting process, both in vertical and horizontal wells. That's delivering better recovery from the existing reservoirs, too. And to me, the more you can get out of the reservoir that you've developed, the better off you are and even better when you can go back into existing wells and get more out of those. 
So I'm quite confident that we will continue on both the OpEx side and the drilling side, completion side and facilities to continue to lower our cost. Our teams are driven to do it and did it even during this pandemic and did it in a big way. 
So I think in New Mexico, they -- in several of the areas that they worked really hard there, they lowered our breakeven on some of those areas by $10 a barrel. So all of that's incredibly encouraging for what we have going forward, considering the footprint that we have in the areas that we know the best."

We do fully expect that debt goes down, it will translate into equity value in the total enterprise value, which is good for our shareholders. But we understand that talking about reducing debt doesn't seem to suit wholly exciting. But there's something other exciting going on.

And what are the risk of drilling the 3 miles versus 1 mile or 10,000 feet? 
So I think that there are cases where there may be situations and scenarios where longer lateral than 10,000. In fact, we drilled 15,000 ourselves. We did at least 1 or 2 of those. And we've drilled more than 10,000. In other cases, they didn't go all the way to the 15,000, but I think it really depends on the reservoir and the things that you have to take into consideration against your acreage position, your full fill development plan, how you intend to complete it, how you intend to -- what kind of artificial lift you intend to use. 
So there are a lot of variables involved. But I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't say that we would never consider doing our 15,000-foot wells again. It's always under evaluation, not only in the Permian, but anywhere we drill horizontal wells. So we wouldn't rule it out. 
And with respect to CO2, CO2 we expect to use in both the conventional and the unconventional. And in the conventional alone, there's 2 billion barrels of additional resources that could be developed with what we expect to be much lower or no cost CO2 in the future. And then the enhanced oil recovery of the shale as well. So we're excited about that."

I'd like to start this morning by saying how pleased we are with our first quarter operational and financial performance.

I'd like to start this morning by saying how pleased we are with our first quarter operational and financial performance. The momentum generated by our improved cost structure and capital intensity leadership was a catalyst for our strong results this quarter and is expected to continue to provide a solid foundation for free cash flow generation. 
This morning, I will cover our first quarter operational performance and divestiture progress. Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our updated guidance, which includes an increase in guidance for midstream and OxyChem's 2021 earnings.  
Our first quarter results are a perfect example of how our ability to consistently deliver strong operational performance has strengthened our financial position. In the first quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, which is our highest level of quarterly free cash flow in a decade. We also closed almost $500 million of divestitures, repaid $174 million of debt and exited the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of unrestricted cash.  
Our plan to stabilize 2021 production at our fourth quarter 2020 exit rate is on track. We delivered first quarter production from continuing operations of over 1.1 million BOE per day, with total company-wide capital spending of only $579 million. We're particularly proud of this achievement, given the operational challenge posed by winter storm Uri.  
Our domestic oil and gas operating cost of $7.20 per BOE continued to demonstrate the lasting impact of our cost-reduction measures and includes about $83 million of atypical costs related to the winter storm. I want to note that we have fully recovered from the storm with no lasting impact. Even with incurring storm-related costs in the first quarter, our full year domestic operating guidance has only increased by $0.10 per BOE, which represents a significantly smaller increase than the approximate $0.25 per BOE that the $83 million in total OpEx would have otherwise added. This is a significant achievement made possible by our teams continuously seeking efficiencies and finding innovative ways to safely and effectively lower costs.  
In the first quarter, OxyChem benefited from robust PVC pricing and gradual strengthening in the caustic soda market. OxyChem's integration across multiple chlorine derivatives provides us with the ability to optimize our caustic soda production while opportunistically adjusting our production mix to maximize margins. OxyChem's ability to adjust to rapidly changing market dynamics was invaluable during the downturn last year, and we were able to provide critical products to the medical, pharmaceutical and disinfection markets to respond to COVID. Given the recent improvements in the chlorovinyl and caustic soda markets, we expect OxyChem to extend its track record as a market leader and consistent generator of free cash flow. 
Additionally, during winter storm Uri, our team was able to safely protect our assets as well as provide essential products to our customers. Our team's effective response limited the storm's impact on facility maintenance cost to an immaterial amount. 
Midstream and marketing's outperformance compared to guidance in the first quarter was primarily driven by our ability to optimize long-haul gas transportation in the Rockies, along with the timing impact of export sales. Following the increase in activity in the fourth quarter, our oil and gas business continued to push the envelope with new efficiency gains as we seamlessly transitioned into the first quarter.  
Our Permian teams outperformed expectations in the first quarter by setting new drilling records in New Mexico, the Texas Delaware and the Midland Basin, while also driving down costs. Our first quarter Permian achievements are especially impressive as we have now augmented the efficiencies of our Oxy Drilling Dynamics with remote directional drilling, an exciting innovation that allows the drill bit to be steered from a separate location. Being able to control and optimize our operations remotely and instantaneously apply shared expertise to similar activities has numerous advantages that we expect our operations to benefit from in the future.  
We also continue to achieve significant efficiency improvements in the Rockies, where in the first quarter, our DJ drilling team reached our lowest average cost per foot in program history. I'd also like to highlight Oman for their best-ever HES performance with no recordables in the first quarter while drilling the longest laterals in Oxy Oman history and achieving record drilling times.  
After a pause of the issuance of new drilling permits on federal land earlier this year, we have now started to see the process move forward again with the approval of new permits. We currently do not expect the permitting process to have an impact on our activity levels as we still plan to run an average of 11 rigs in the Permian this year and 2 in the Rockies.  
In late April, I testified before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in support of lifting the federal leasing moratorium. As I told the committee, continued onshore oil and gas development means high-paying jobs, community reinvestment and meeting energy and product needs during the transition to a low-carbon economy. We look forward to working with Congress and the administration on ways to create clarity and short- and long-term regulatory certainty.  
After we announced the sale of our Colombia onshore assets last year, we updated our divestiture plan to sell $2 billion to $3 billion of assets by the middle of this year. Our progress towards this target continues as we closed almost $500 million of sales in the first quarter. Post Colombia, we now have closed approximately $835 million of divestitures and are well on our way to achieving our target. But we will continue to make the best value decisions by weighing the impact of future cash flows in our current environment versus the benefits of meeting a deadline or divestiture target.  
Looking back over the last year, I'm particularly proud of the accomplishments our teams have achieved and look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. Not only have we optimized our portfolio, improved our balance sheet and continued to reduce costs, we've also created the pathway to achieve net 0 emissions. As we take our next steps toward achieving our future goals, including further balance sheet improvement, returning additional capital to shareholders and bringing our first commercial scale direct air capture plant online, we will continue to maintain our low-cost, capital efficient, stable production base with a goal of maximizing free cash flow generation through capital discipline and margin preservation.  
Our cash flow priorities are structured with the aim of positioning our company for future success. While we are encouraged by the improving macro environment and are especially proud of our team's ability to maintain and sustain our production base, we will continue to improve our balance sheet until we reach the point where our financial position will support a more meaningful return on capital and return of capital to our shareholders throughout the commodity cycle.  
I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the first quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year."

I want to echo Vicki's comments on our strong performance in the first quarter. Our cash flow priorities illustrate the importance we continue to place on capital discipline, free cash flow generation and balance sheet improvement. As we look ahead on the steps necessary to transition from our current to our medium-term cash flow priorities, our focus on balance sheet improvement will continue to influence our financial policies.  
Throughout 2020, which was one of the worst years our industry has endured, we focused on deleveraging and have continued to reduce debt in the first quarter of this year. We repaid approximately $9.6 billion of principal since August of 2019, with more to come as we can complete our divestiture program combined with leveraging our ability to rate excess free cash flow and maintain our commitment to capital discipline.  
On past calls, I've highlighted our preference for a viable path to return to investment-grade credit rating. We're allocating excess cash flow to our medium-term priorities. Our credit ratings are based on several factors, including a certain level of debt, returning to investment-grade in a mid-cycle commodity price environment may include reducing debt to the mid-$20 billion range. We are not there here today, but we believe this goal is achievable, given our potential to generate free cash flow.  
We repaid $174 million of debt in the first quarter and now have less than $225 million of maturities due the remainder of 2021. If we generate cash from organic free cash flow, close our remaining divestitures, we have some more options available to deploy that cash, improve our balance sheet. We have the option to call the 2022 floating rate notes prior to maturity and may at times allow our cash cushion to build until maturities come due.  
We have additional options available to address future maturities, which we are currently evaluating. We may also consider retiring $750 million of notional interest rate swaps later this year for the fair value amount, which was approximately $665 million at quarter end. This would improve cash flows by almost $50 million per annum at the current curve.  
In the first quarter, we announced an adjusted loss of $0.15 per share and a reported loss of $0.36 per share. The difference between our adjusted and reported results is primarily due to a gain on asset sales and positive fair value adjustments, offset by planned lease expiries and a legal contingency related to our 2016 settlement with Ecuador.  
This quarter, we classified all derivative instruments with mark-to-market adjustments as items affecting the clearability. We expect this change will be helpful to investors comparing underlying business performance between periods and reconciling actual results to our guidance, which had previously excluded the mark-to-market adjustment.  
We were able to add additional gas hedges in the quarter and have now hedged approximately half of our 2021 domestic natural gas production with a floor of $2.50 per Mcf. We are on track to spend within our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion, having incurred capital expenditures of only $579 million in the first quarter.  
Our operational success, combined with our focus on sustaining production in a more supportive commodity price environment, enabled us to generate $1.6 billion in free cash flow and exit the quarter with almost $2.3 billion on restricted cash in hand. Our business incurred a negative working capital change in the quarter, which was largely driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to commodity price recovery. Over half of the working capital change was due to commodity price, which reflects the timing difference between whatever is recognized when the cash is received.  
We also made several payments that are typical in the first quarter, including property taxes, cash interest payments, employee benefit payments and pension contributions. We see the potential for the working capital change to partially reverse over the remainder of this year as expenses accrued last year were already paid in the first quarter of this year. 
We are pleased to be able to update our full year guidance for midstream and OxyChem, reflecting strong first quarter performance and improved market conditions. Our revised guidance, combined with our operational achievements, have enabled us to lower our 2021 breakeven to the mid-$30 range on a WTI basis before the preferred dividend.  
I would like to reiterate that despite the first quarter weather impact to our Permian production of approximately 25,000 BOE per day, as guided on our last call, combined with the production impact associated with divesting $282 million -- $285 million of minerals and a negative PSC impact of over 5,000 BOE per day related to higher oil prices, our full year production guidance of 1.14 million BOEs per day remains intact, as does our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion.  
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

We are encouraged by the positive reception our 2020 Climate Report received following its release in December as well as the enthusiasm our low carbon strategy continues to generate.

While we are not yet able to share the economics, we will have created partnerships to finance and deploy cutting-edge CCUS technology, which leverages our expertise and our tens of billions of dollars worth of CO2 infrastructure, assets and floor space. We are creating these cross-industry opportunities for others to invest alongside us to maximize the deployment pace and carbon removal impact. We look forward to sharing more information when possible.  
As part of being a socially and environmentally responsible operator, we consistently make operational improvements in addition to working toward our net 0 goals. In the first quarter, we started a water recycling facility in the Midland Basin and began utilizing recycled water in our South Curtis Ranch development. In partnership with an industry-leading water midstream company, we were able to increase our water recycling efforts and lower cost. Recycling water has been a large focus of ours in New Mexico for several years, and we are pleased to have been able to expand this effort into Texas.  
Before we begin the Q&A, I want to announce that in April, we became the first U.S. oil and gas company to commit to adopting the World Economic Forum's stakeholder capitalism metrics. This commitment will guide our process to incorporate the forum's metrics most relevant to our business into our environmental, social and governance reporting. We believe this is the appropriate framework to supplement our reporting on ESG progress, enhance transparency and strengthen our engagement with investors and other stakeholders.

So our revised guidance, when you combine in operational achievements, did lower our breakeven, I would say, mid-$30 range on a WTI basis before the preferred dividend. Specifically, we give a range because it is influenced by a number of factors that you listed, including the cash flows, including the natural gas prices, realization for our products, divestiture timing and where chemicals and midstream falls in respect of earnings guidance. And obviously, this quarter, we were able to significantly improve our guidance on both the chemicals and midstream business, which has a material impact on that range.  
In addition to that, as we take that organic cash flow and we can further improve the breakeven and doing things like I mentioned in my opening comments regarding interest rate swaps, where we retired the $665 million of notional value or $750 million notional value, that was $665 million at the end of the quarter, we're able to eliminate about $50 million of interest costs for the year using the current curve. So there's a lot of things that go into that.  
In terms of forecasting out cash flow into the year, we don't forecast cash flow forward on that side of it. I think you can see a pretty representative quarter. It's a fairly clean quarter outside of a few things. And I think you can see -- illuminate the working capital and get an idea what kind of cash we would generate at similar prices moving forward."

If that were a direct pay to us for the carbon that we capture, that's another enabler that allows us to accelerate the construction of the technology, get that advanced faster and more built sooner. So there, we're looking at multiple ways to accelerate all that we're doing in the Permian with respect to direct air capture."

That",405,"I think the changes that will come out will not impact current leases. I do believe that we'll be able to continue permitting on current leases. My concern is that there could be a moratorium, a longer-term moratorium on picking up additional leases. That would be bad for our industry. It would be bad for the United States. It would put our country in a position where we would likely have an even tougher time increasing production above where the United States is today. 
As you know, we were at one point over 13 million barrels a day of oil production from the U.S. That's a scenario that gave us strength in world politics. It gave us the ability to completely supply our own oil and products domestically. We would not have to import very much at all at a 13 million barrel a day level because I believe our refining capacity is somewhere near 17 million. So we would have some capability to be almost completely independent. 
With a moratorium on federal leases, that would really drive down our industry's ability to react. Now where we are in that, we've got 9.5 million acres of -- to develop in the U.S. And of that 9.5 million acres, I think only about 1.6 million are federal, and about half of that is offshore. So from a new lease standpoint, there are some companies that are in better positions than others, and we believe we are. 
But what I'm advocating for is the industry and for the country because the other thing about this is some of this is being touted as a way to reduce emissions for the United States, which would be definitely a bad move because we are very prudent with what we're doing in United States compared to a lot of countries around the world. We've reduced emissions significantly in the U.S. and continue to push technologies to further reduce. 
API, we're part of API, and a lot of companies within API have committed to a voluntary partnership where we're all working to share technologies and to help each other reduce emissions and to get the best available technology in place to address emissions and climate change. So I think that, for me, the biggest worry is not on existing leases. It's just the moratorium could be extended for a long time on picking -- or anybody picking up any new releases."

And as we have mentioned before, we started working on this low carbon strategy because we wanted a more sustainable source for CO2 and a lower-cost CO2 for our enhan",665,"No. Our low carbon strategy is very connected to our CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects. And as we have mentioned before, we started working on this low carbon strategy because we wanted a more sustainable source for CO2 and a lower-cost CO2 for our enhanced oil recovery. 
Where we're positioned today is incredibly exciting because in the Permian Basin, we have such a footprint of not only reservoirs, floor space and resources, we have the processing plants. We have the pipelines and all of that necessary to further accelerate development of additional 2 billion barrels in our conventional reservoirs. And this, we haven't even been able to calculate yet what we could get from CO2-enhanced oil recovery in the shale. 
But doing that in the Permian, doing that in the DJ Basin and the Powder River, that sets us up for decades to come of generating new reserves and production from existing reservoirs. And so really, it's tied to that. It's tied to being able to create value for our shareholders through the extended production of more reserves than what can typically be produced out of conventional or unconventional resources. 
For example, in conventional reservoirs, with CO2, you can get up to 70% or better recovery. And whereas with just primary development, normally, you get 20% to 25% at most. So we can get better than 70% with CO2 flooding. In the unconventional where most companies will tell you that you'll get, at most, 10% to 12% recovery of the hydrocarbons from the shale play, but with CO2-enhanced oil recovery, we've tested it, we've run 4 pilots, and we now know that we can potentially get 75% additional recovery or maybe even double it. 
So we're sitting in a position now where we have a significant amount of future potential development. And we have it in the areas where we operate, the areas where we already have the infrastructure. So as we go forward, our incremental production and recoveries are just going to continue to be at lower and lower cost beyond the point where we were able to get these direct air capture facilities built. 
But what's also going to help us there, too, and help further lower cost is executing on our NET Power technology, which we're also an equity investor in. NET Power is a process that generates a lower cost of electricity by combusting hydrocarbons with oxygen, and it therefore spits off a pure stream of CO2 that -- and no other emissions. So we can take that CO2 and use it in our reservoirs. So it's essentially a lower-cost, emission-free electrical generation process for us. 
So we have a lot of ways as we go forward, and this is why we're incredibly excited, a lot of ways to get more oil out of the ground for lower cost. And so as we go forward, our cost structure will continue to decrease, not just from the debt reduction that Rob has talked about, but from the actual development and operations in the field. 
And in addition to that, we will be able to provide aviation and maritime industries with a net carbon 0 oil. So we're going to be the solution for actually aviation and maritime, and that's why United wanted to join with us on building this first direct air capture facility. So it's exciting for us. 
Sorry, if I'm talking too long on this. I'll stop here and see if you have anything else to ask, but it's exciting for us. And we're really looking forward to being able to talk more about this. And as I said in my script, we can't yet because we're in the middle of some processes and some discussions and interactions with others. But we hope that in the fall or close to the end of the year, we will be able to share more about it and get you a model that you'll be able to see and understand at that point."

And then everything that we're getting in and every divestiture that we have the potential to do, we always want to evaluate what it delivers for us versus what the cash flow in the future would generate. 
So it's a value proposition for us. And it's also ensuring that -- the other part of the consideration is making sure that we have enough cash flow to meet our maturities, debt maturities and even to go beyond that to, as Rob was saying, to deal with the interest rate swaps and some other minor costs that we have. So it's all about lowering our cost structure, making sure that we maximize our higher-margin cash flow, keep that intact. 
So we still have gone -- we have not announced any others that we have, but we do have a couple of -- several things actually in process, a couple that have a -- that are higher priorities for us to do. One is Ghana, as we've talked about it before. But because we have several processes running now, we feel comfortable that we'll get to the $2 billion.

When you go",390,"Yes. Sure, Neil. Happy to do that for you. So if you look at a typical first quarter, we historically see a somewhat significant draw in the first quarter because of the -- but it was certainly more sizable in the first quarter of this year. 
When you go back to 2018, Q1 draw of about $700 million. In 2019, it was about $900 million. And for the opposite reasons for this quarter 2020, it was about $200 million draw because with price going the opposite direction, obviously, in March when the pandemic hit and with the price wars going on. So regardless, the $1.3 billion draw we experienced in the first quarter does and is exceptionally large. The majority of that was driven by the change in commodity prices. It was the timing difference between revenue recognition and cash received. 
So at the end of 2020, WTI was about $48 a barrel, and it was $61 a barrel at the end of March. And so this price increase of 30% impacts both our AR balances and our inventory significantly, especially when you consider our midstream business and how many barrels are on the water at any given point in time. And even that's a bit exacerbated because we discussed a bit last time that Europe essentially has been shut down a significant cargoes of oil from the Gulf since the third quarter of last year. And as a result, we've had to change our mix or portfolio of export shipments, which are now, for the most part, heavily weighted to -- it's not exclusively related to shipments to Asia, which is longer voyages, more crude on the water longer because of the transit times. 
And then obviously, compared to other years, we have a pretty modest capital budget. And so we're not creating a significant amount of payables or capital spending. And so when you look at it, it's a combination of the price impacts, coupled with all those first quarter events like the financial interest payments, the payments for property taxes, we made a significant contribution to the APC pension plan during the first quarter, and then -- so we put it all together, we do expect, as you pointed out, as receivables start to come in, that some of that will reverse as the year goes on."

So absolutely, nothing happy to do than talk about our chemical business, which had an excellent start to the year. When you look at the chemical business, it has both some impacts from winter storm Uri, to some extent, but also because how winter storm Uri impacted the overall business itself. 
And so chlor-alkali production struggled significantly in March post storm. If you think about Uri, it had a much wider impact than any individual hurricane we had in the past. And so you still have a lot of inspections, et cetera, going on, restarts going in the month of March. And that has extended into after a very difficult hurricane season last year. And so going into the end of 2020, we already had a pretty tight supply-demand balance in the second half of the year. And that was coupled with a pretty significant amount of demand. As you know, building products are in very high demand right now. So our PVC demand and margins were significant already going into the year. 
And so if you look at our operating rates as the industry, they're only about 71.5% for the first quarter of '21, whereas last year, they were 89%. And so the combination of the stronger demand, coupled with the production off-line to start the year, has already tightened up an already tight supply-demand balance. 
And so in the case of PVC, construction investment is very strong. Demand is expected to range strong, with the housing starts outlook, low mortgage rates, a lot of emphasis on remodeling, et cetera, right now that is driving PVC demand. So PVC demand domestically is up almost 5% compared to the same period in 2020, which drives down the amount of PVC that's actually being exported. And exports were actually down about 30% compared to the same period last year. 
And so with resin tight in the domestic market, we're able to expand margins, just like we would in our commodity under a tight supply-demand balance. And then what we're seeing in the caustic soda business is whereas previously when we guided, we anticipated to start -- we're seeing caustic soda bottom, and we thought we would start to see improvements in the second half of the year, Uri has pulled that forward a bit. And so now we're seeing caustic soda prices improve in the second quarter as we move forward. So we're just getting more of that as the year goes on. And so we're expecting not only continued high margins in the PVC business and resilient demand through the balance of the year as construction continues to pull. I mean, PVC's really different. We're seeing prices of wood and everything else. We'll also see caustic soda benefit from that process at all. 
And as Vicki mentioned, Oxy's significant amount of other derivatives beyond just PVC that we sell gives the company a lot more variability in the molecules that it can sell, produce additional caustic soda and produce additional value in other parts of the chlorine chain, which is going to expand our ability to increase the value delivered by the business. I just -- it's the reason why we talk about how much value is locked in the chemical business and why when people talk to us about the chemical business a lot of times and why we don't see something different with it is because it's just hard for people to grasp with a small commodity chemical business that can turn out these types of cash flow on this asset base. And it's really -- it's a remarkable business."

And so is it exactly 20 -- $10 billion? Obviously, there's a lot of different things to factor, as I indicated in my remarks, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of that. It's somewhere -- other things will go into that. It could mitigate it to be a little higher than that would be possible or even a little lower than that. But obviously, there's a lot of things that go into it, but it's somewhere in that range. 
So even though that you can probably move forward and get pretty close to that or lower that 3x in your model for the second half of the year.

So Jeanine, I would say that, obviously, as with Vicki's remarks, we're squarely focused on the leverage reduction right now and looking at opportunity to get down to that investment-grade type level.

And that can be through a host of different things, as I discussed on remarks, between what we're evaluating near term on the ability to put that cash to work to reduce debt. 
That conversation will eventually rotate over into medium-term priorities, focusing on the dividend. But we haven't established a policy on what the dividend might look like. It's going to need to be sustainable, as we've indicated in our priorities. So it could be a combination of something that's fixed and some variable component.

And then as part of that, as we think about the margin expansion opportunities going forward, are you still identifying things like upside with contribution from the Anadarko transaction? Or maybe said another way, is there still more room to run on reducing the cost structure here? And what are some of the levers to drive that cost structure down?"
293286,710695552,2280689,"Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 11, 2021",2021-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Occidental Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Yes, you're right. There's more opportunities to continue to reduce our cost structure in both capital and OpEx. And one example I'll give is we went back recently and took a look at our drilling performance between 2015 up through what we're doing in 202",718,"Yes, you're right. There's more opportunities to continue to reduce our cost structure in both capital and OpEx. And one example I'll give is we went back recently and took a look at our drilling performance between 2015 up through what we're doing in 2021. And I can tell you, we rolled out our physics and logistics space, Oxy Drilling Dynamics in our domestic operations in 2015 and then rolled it out internationally in late 2016. 
And I think I said before, we haven't seen an area where we've rolled this out that we haven't had about a 20% to 30% reduction in our cost. And the exciting thing in looking at our data today is we've decreased our drilling cost from $200 a foot back in 2015 to $135 a foot in 2021 for our global drilling. That's everything around the world. 
And so we've individually pointed out the performance improvements in the Permian, but we've not only seen it in the Permian. We've seen it in the DJ, in the Powder River. And now Oman is seeing a lot of good things happening there by using this process, and it's proprietary to us. We developed it. 
So it's making a difference. We've also started deploying it to the Gulf of Mexico and seeing some good things there that we'll be able to quantify and report on here in the near future. 
So it's drilling. On the drilling side, it's still -- and I will say before I leave drilling, some people might say that you probably got all that. And right now, we're not improving. From 2019 to 2020, even in the downturn, we improved by 14% what we were doing there. So there's -- the improvement is happening even today. So far this year, we've improved by about 4% only 1 quarter into it. This is as we were picking up rigs. So this is -- what we're doing there is working. But also on the completion side, we're still setting records for how many fracs we can do in a 24-hour period, and so that's improving. 
The other thing we're seeing is that our Permian team, the -- every one of them actually is continuing to work on the subsurface model. And this has been a point of extreme emphasis for us because of the variation in the shale play. So we started really enhancing our subsurface expertise about 6 or 7 years ago and working hard to get that to where we needed it to be. 
We have some incredible people in-house that now do that work. And that -- what we've learned in the shale play, we've extended also to looking at conventional and to doing more with seismic. And part of that was driven by the good efforts that the Anadarko staff had accomplished and achieved with some of the 3D seismic. And our team, some of our domestic people started looking at how others were doing things and taking what others are doing and made it better. 
So every phase of what we're doing, we're trying to do better. And we're seeing still continuing improvement. Oman is using what they call an Oxy jetting system where in existing wells, they can go in and jet with a process that ensures maximum contact with the reservoir through each phase of the jetting process, both in vertical and horizontal wells. That's delivering better recovery from the existing reservoirs, too. And to me, the more you can get out of the reservoir that you've developed, the better off you are and even better when you can go back into existing wells and get more out of those. 
So I'm quite confident that we will continue on both the OpEx side and the drilling side, completion side and facilities to continue to lower our cost. Our teams are driven to do it and did it even during this pandemic and did it in a big way. 
So I think in New Mexico, they -- in several of the areas that they worked really hard there, they lowered our breakeven on some of those areas by $10 a barrel. So all of that's incredibly encouraging for what we have going forward, considering the footprint that we have in the areas that we know the best."

We do fully expect that when debt goes down, it will translate into equity value, in the total enterprise value, which is good for our shareholders. But we understand that talking about reducing debt doesn't seem to suit wholly exciting. But there's something exciting going on.

And maybe then shifting focus to some of the other initiatives. I know carbon capture and low carbon, you spoke a few times already, but I have one follow-up there. As we think about the milestones from here to reaching FID on some of these potential projects, including the direct air capture project in the Permian, can you just walk us through what's remaining there? It sounds like policy and financing isn't one of the milestones at this point. But what are we looking for in order to bring that project to fruition?"

And what are the risk of drilling the 3 miles versus 1 mile or 10,000 feet? 
So I think that there are cases where there may be situations and scenarios where longer lateral than 10,000. In fact, we drilled 15,000 ourselves. We did at least 1 or 2 of those. And we've drilled more than 10,000. In other cases, they didn't go all the way to the 15,000, but I think it really depends on the reservoir and all the things that you have to take into consideration against your acreage position, your full fill development plan, how you intend to complete it, how you intend to -- what kind of artificial lift you intend to use. 
So there are a lot of variables involved. But I wouldn't -- I certainly wouldn't say that we would never consider doing our 15,000-foot wells again. It's always under evaluation, not only in the Permian, but anywhere we drill horizontal wells. So we wouldn't rule it out. 
And with respect to CO2, CO2, we expect to use in both the conventional and the unconventional. And in the conventional alone, there's 2 billion barrels of additional resources that could be developed with what we expect to be much lower or no cost CO2 in the future. And the enhanced oil recovery of the shale as well. So we're excited about that."

Our strong operational performance in the second quarter continued to drive robust financial performance as we marked our second consecutive quarter of generating the highest level of free cash flow in over a decade. As was the case last quarter, our cost structure and capital intensity leadership were catalysts for our strong results and continue to provide a solid foundation for free cash flow generation in the future. We're especially pleased to have been in a position at the end of the second quarter to launch a tender process to retire over $3 billion of debt using excess cash generated from operations as well as proceeds from divestitures. While we made incremental progress in reducing debt throughout 2020 in the first half of 2021, the completion of this tender represents a sizable step forward in our deleveraging efforts. 
This morning, I'll cover our second quarter operational performance and divestiture progress, and Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our updated guidance, which includes an improvement to our DD&A rate an increase in guidance for our full year production and for midstream and oxygen 2021 earnings. In the second quarter, our business -- all of our businesses outperformed. Our capital discipline and efficiency, combined with the supportive and improving commodity price environment positions us to generate the highest level of free cash flow before and after working capital since the third quarter of 2008 when WTI hit $145 a barrel. 
We are proud of our teams for this accomplishment, and we appreciate that they are continuing to improve our capital execution and operating efficiencies to further expand our margins. We exited the quarter with approximately $4.6 billion of unrestricted cash, which does not include cash received in July from the recently closed divestiture or the cash used for the debt tender, which closed in July. Rob will touch on this under in a little more detail, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are to be once again making notable progress in reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Turning to our operational results. Our oil and gas business delivered second quarter production from continuing operations of over 1.2 million BOE per day. The total company-wide capital spending of almost $698 million. Our domestic oil and gas operating cost of $6 per BOE came in substantially below our full year guidance as our teams continue to demonstrate their innovative operations expertise by finding new ways to safely reduce costs in our field operations. In the second quarter, OxyChem continued to benefit from robust PBC demand and pricing as well as gradual strengthening in the caustic soda market. We believe the fundamentals for these markets will remain supportive through the second half of 2021, we are confident in increasing our full year guidance to a midpoint of $1.25 billion, representing an almost 60% increase over our original guidance for the year. The ability of our oil and gas business to overcome challenges while increasing efficiencies has been transformational. Looking back over the first 6 months of this year, we overcame the impacts of a major weather event and divested of producing our assets. 
We were able to make up the lost and divested production and have increased our full year production guidance for continuing operations to 1.15 million BOE per day. We continue to be highly encouraged by well performance across our portfolio. For example, in the Texas Delaware, we recently brought online a new silver chip development that is producing approximately 20% more oil compared to a prior development in this area. Additionally, in an area of roughly 10 miles southeast of Silvertip, we brought online a 5-well development with average 30-day peak rates of almost 5,000 BOE per day. As I mentioned, operationally, our teams continue to set new efficiency records while constantly pursuing opportunities to improve. We set new quarterly records across our portfolio on feet drilled and hours pumps in a single day. In the Midland Basin, we set a new drilling record with over 9,500 feet drilled in 24 hours, contributing to a new Oxy Permian Bud to rig release record, drilling a 10,000-foot horizontal well in only 8 days. In the DJ Basin, we set a new company-wide track record of pumping over 23 hours in a single day. 
Utilizing Oxy drilling dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico, we have significantly lower drilling cost and duration as the well drilled in 2021 have cost 15% less than the average for 2019. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we've had excellent results, leveraging remote operations. Our innovative mindset and ability to deleverage technological breakthroughs have allowed us to continue pushing the performance envelope, giving me confidence that our best-in-class capital efficiency will continue. Our divestiture plan advanced in the second quarter with the recent closing of a noncore Permian acreage sale for approximately $510 million. Given our industry-leading inventory depth, we welcome the opportunity to monetize these assets at an attractive price as it is unlikely that we would have developed this acreage in the near future. 
We expect to close at least $2 billion of divestitures post Colombia. And as we've said previously, we'll always prioritize obtaining value for our shareholders over meeting a deadline. I want to take a few minutes to talk about our chemical business and how we plan to leverage its leadership and expertise into our low carbon ventures business. OxyChem's success is demonstrated by its financial performance and track record of consistent free cash flow generation. OxyChem has been a consistent generator of free cash flow during past downturns. And with the macro environment improving, OxyChem is on track to deliver record earnings this year, even surpassing 2018's results. The business may also continue to strengthen in future years as caustic soda, one of the key profit drivers for the business, has experienced only a moderate price recovery to date. 
Last quarter, I spoke about how OxyChem's integration across multiple [indiscernible] derivatives provides us with the ability to optimize our caustic soda production while opportunistically adjusting our production mix to maximize margins. There are many opportunities for us to apply the same approach to integration as we develop opportunities between OxyChem and our Low Carbon Ventures business. As a major producer of PVC and caustic potash, OptoChem has the engineering, R&D and process technology expertise as well as the production capability necessary to build our low-carbon business. OxyChem is the world leader in the customization, handling and usage of PVC, which will be a major component in the construction and ongoing operation of the direct air capture facility. We're also one of the world's largest leading producers of caustic potash. The key chemical utilized in the direct air capture process to separate carbon dioxide for sequestration or carbon neutral enhanced oil recovery. 
Our vast knowledge of equipment design and our experience with operating and handling the caustic potash will be key to helping us quickly optimize our direct air capture facilities. In addition to being a market leader and consistent free cash flow generator, OxyChem is integral to our business of today and of tomorrow. It's also worth noting that OxyChem is a market leader in health, safety and environmental performance. recently earned a remarkable 31 responsible care awards. These are from the American Chemistry Council and or the U.S. chemical manufacturing industry's leading performance awards. The award recognized OxyChem's achievements in safety, waste reduction and improving energy efficiency. Several of the award-winning initiatives focused on waste minimization, reuse, recycling and energy efficiency which will all contribute to our 2025 sustainability goals. I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our businesses continue to perform well in the second quarter as our free cash flow generation affirmed our confidence not us ability to generate cash and a healthy price environment. The strong performance contributed to a quarter end u",1124,"Thank you, Vicki. Our businesses continue to perform well in the second quarter as our free cash flow generation affirmed our confidence not us ability to generate cash and a healthy price environment. The strong performance contributed to a quarter end unrestricted cash balance of $4.6 billion. On our last call, I mentioned the potential for a partial reversal of the working capital change incurred in the first quarter. As expected, we benefited from a positive working capital change this quarter of approximately $600 million further contributing to our cash build during the quarter. As Vicki mentioned, we launched a tender late in the quarter and able to repay over $3 billion of debt in July subsequent to successful execution of a debt tender in July, we received proceeds from the nonstrategic Permian acreage, partially refreshing our post-tender cash position early in the quarter. 
In the second quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $0.32 and a reported loss of $0.10 per diluted share. While we place greater importance on cash flow generation, especially as we are focused on deleveraging we are pleased to be generating income on an adjusted basis. Indeed, this is a positive indication that our financial position continues to improve. Our reported results were less than our adjusted results primarily due to mark-to-market impact of derivatives. We delivered outstanding production results year-to-date while having deployed less than half of our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion. We expect capital spending to remain within budget, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and our capital intensity leadership, even as capital spending is pretty higher in the second half than the first half of the year. The positive working capital change realized in the quarter was driven by lower cash payments for items that are accrued throughout the year and lower crude inventory from fewer barrels in the water, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance due to the increase in commodity prices. 
As the interest payments on our bonds are made semiannually, our cash interest payments are soon to be lower in the second and fourth quarters than they are in the first and third quarters. During the downturn last year, we received approximately $1 billion of additional cash flow from our oil hedges. To obtain a cost of structure, we sold a 2021 call position of 350,000 barrels a day at an average strike price of [ $74.16 ] rent. As the commodity prices rose at the end of the second quarter, we made payments of $5.7 million under the sold call position and $1 million under our gas hedges in July.  As [indiscernible] paid to date on the hedges have been minimal and are certainly what the benefit we received last year. 
We continue to maintain an opportunistic approach towards hedging in the fourth curve is supportive but not added any hedges past the end of this year. We believe creating a manageable debt maturity profile and reducing debt as a more effective long-term solution to derisking the balance sheet while providing shareholders with exposure to commodity price gains. We raised our full year production guidance following our strong second quarter results and have increased our earnings guidance for OxyChem and Midstream for the second time this year, reflecting strong first half performance and improved market conditions. 
We expect that 2021 will be a record year for OxyChem. Even surpassing our earnings in 2018, we benefit from exceptionally strong caustic soda prices in the middle part of that here. Instruments expected the benefit in the second half of the year from continued higher sulfur prices at [indiscernible] as well as an uplisting the third quarter related to the timing of export sales. We also lowered our DD&A guidance for 2021, reflecting the midyear reserves update. This update takes an account more supportive trailing 12-month commodity prices at midyear compared to year-end 2020 as well as our activity plans and recent success in lowering operating costs. 
The combination of these factors have increased our proved reserves, which we expect to result in a lower DD&A rate going forward. Our production in the second half of 2021 is expected to average [ 1.14 million ] BOE per day, using the second quarter benefited from time to market acceleration in the Rockies and Permian. -- favor weather conditions and optimization of planned maintenance schedules to better sequence shutdown activities resulted in lower-than-expected downtime in Gulf of Mexico, contributing to higher-than-expected production. 
Our expected third quarter production of 1.145 million BOE per day includes an allowance for seasonal weather and maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico, the divestiture of approximately 10,000 BOE per day in the Permian, the timing impact of our Rockies capital program, which was front-loaded in 2021, as well as PSC impact seater price. Even as production in the second half of year is cite lower than the impressive second quarter production results, we remain confident in our production trajectory leveling out as we enter 2022, where we anticipate a production pattern similar to 2021. We've updated our activity slide include 2 additional New Mexico rigs. 
New Mexico activity change to be fully funded through the cost savings and optimization of our capital projects came to efficiency improvements and will not increase our capital budget.  Adding activity in one of our highest return to assets will place us in a strong position as we transition into 2022. With the successful completion of our debt tender, we paid over $3 billion in 2022 through 2026 maturities, and I have a clear runway over the next few years. As we generate cash from organic free cash flow, we continue to value the options available for additional debt reduction and we'll seek to further our debt maturity profile so that we're not exposed to any significant amount of maturities in any single year. 
The options available to us for debt reduction include potentially calling the 2020 floating rate notes prior to maturity, executing additional tenders, exercising attractive make-whole provisions, pursuing over market debt repurchases or we may choose, in some cases, to build a cash position which may be applied towards retire maturities as they come due. We also plan to retire $750 million of notional interest rate swaps in the third quarter for the fair value amount, which will improve cash flow by almost [ $50 million ] per annum at the current curve. We entered the second half of 2021 in a strong position at the beginning of the year, and as we look forward to being focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position, deleveraging or regain investment-grade metrics and preserving financial policies and cash flow priorities and bet capital discipline. 
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

As you can see on Slide 7 of the deck, the 2 businesses are the major profit drivers for our chemical business. And it's unusual, but we do have conditions with both business and favorable market conditions, the earnings impact that you're seeing is significant. So on the PVC business, the business remains extremely strong due to a tight supply-demand balance. 
On a year-to-date basis, we're seeing domestic demand as an industry about 16% higher compared to the same period in 2020. But more importantly, it's up 13% from where it was in 2019 in a non-COVID period. And so strong demand is also attributed to really low levels of inventory and supply chain, combined with the construction sector, which you're seeing, and obviously, in a lot of their construction materials. And we expect demand to remain strong with a very favorable housing start outlook. Mortgage rates remaining low, which tends to also drive historically the business and a lot of investment remodeling. And so we're -- those kind of factors are all pointing towards sustained improvement in the PVC business. 
The other thing I would say is that when the export business is soft like it is now, where we're seeing year-to-date exports are down 33%, which tends to be the last location of PVC production, that's indicative of a strong market. And so there's not enough product to go around, we shouldn't see margins remain favorable for us. On the [indiscernible] side, a chlorine molecule itself is very tight. And so producers are seeking the highest value outlets for coin molecules. And as Vicki mentioned, our very diverse portfolio according to derivatives allows us to really maximize the bag of these [indiscernible] molecules through our chain opportunities. And so coil production itself has been under pressure for the year simply because of a lot of both unplanned and planned outages. If you look at [indiscernible] rates, they're actually lower in '21 than they were in '20 year-to-date, running about 75% year-to-date versus 80% over the same period last year, resulting in about 6% less caustic production available this year versus last year. So caustic is quite tight, which is helping improve prices. And with playing out in the schedule in the third quarter, we would anticipate that further support for additional price increases in the caustic soda business. 
And then as you see, caustic for us tends to be something that moves with the global economy. And certainly, as economies open up and eventually travel restrictions eased globally, we should see additional demand in underlying sectors. And so as far as the key demand sectors in the second half, we see better demand in the alumina sector, the paper sector, water treatment and certainly [ ablation ] sectors all improving in the third quarter. So both sides of the ECU are looking strong headed into the second half of the year. the underlying factors certainly are bullish for both of them as we move into 2022 and beyond."

So certainly a topic, [indiscernible]. So we depicted on the 13th slide of the deck, which was the new we included that were essentially on a journey when it comes to cash flow priorities.

So we depicted on the 13th slide of the deck, which was the new we included that were essentially on a journey when it comes to cash flow priorities. And after a lot of risk in 2020 to derisk the company and what I call a post-COVID world between the stabilization of production, the slashing of our costs and refinance near-term maturities,  now we're making headway, as Vicki detailed on our deleveraging process. And we took a significant step quarter with upside tender in July, through both a combination of cash available from strong production performance the continued capital execution and diligent cost management and really the remarkable turnaround in chemicals all contributed to the success of that. 
And so now we've retired about $12.7 billion of principal since the middle of '19 through that combination of our [indiscernible] cash generation and the investor program. And I think we'll continue to work towards the $2 billion to $3 billion post Colombia divesture target that we've established. But as we look forward, it's anticipated that the majority of free cash flow from the business will be the source of future cash for debt retirement. And it's critical that as we take advantage of the elevated prices deleverage the balance sheet because we know any time they are going to be changed in the macro environment that could affect our ultra commodity prices that would inhibit our ability to do that. 
So when I look at the time it takes, our path does remain focused right now on the 2 top priorities being --  that we're focused on in our list. And how long we're on that path, it's certainly dependent upon future commodity prices because that certainly impacts the rate at which we're able to move down the path. But I do think that the steps we've taken since March of '20 are all part of a long-term strategy around increasing value to our shareholders. For example, look at last year in the derisking side, we could have saved a little interest in our refinance process by using more owners and ventures. What we see today with a much less risky maturity profile and a much in the same simple capital structure we started with. And we do believe ultimately deleveraging in the company is going to be the benefit of equity holders in the form of equity appreciation. And we also understand that, that leverage to oil price remains attractive and is a pace of that process. And our EBITDA does fluctuate obviously a lot with commodity prices. And while some agencies have modestly increased their models, their prices are still well below the current strip. So that's why we keep saying it to get to a more sustainable debt level in the mid-20 range is likely necessary to achieve those ID-like financial metrics. In addition to debt ratio, we understand obviously financial policies matter and invest great decision. So use of cash or dividends growth, et cetera, also be viewed in the near term unfavorably. So that's why we remain focused on the deleveraging process. And once we reach that more sustainable debt level, we will start resuming a greater amount of cash to shareholders."

So we're constantly looking at and updating optimizing our plans and looking at those opportunities where could there be additional situations where we have the same thing that we just did with this Permian acreage, monetize it today and have the opportunity to create better value today than to to keep it in the portfolio when we know we can't get to it.

But for us, the things we've sold just could not compete and could not add the value that other things in our portfolio could.

So certainly, historically, the company has not been one with a hedging philosophy and felt like the combination of our exposure to commodities and exposure to the price of the long haul would ultimately deliver the most value to our shareholders versus attempting to use hedges to try and create value. And that's certainly changed in 2020 because we were in a position where our leverage was such that it was necessary for us to create some protection in the event we are in a negative price environment like what [indiscernible] worked out that way. And certainly, the $1 billion that we were able to create in value last year from the hedge was something that was critical to our success last year. And we'll continue to maintain the opportunity approach. But as we evaluate hedges, we're consuming a lot of factors. Number 1 is the cost to execute the hedge. Certainly, at [indiscernible] the cost of pegs that we did last year came with a call provision this year. which hasn't been very expensive, but they can be and the implications that the hedge is going to have on the upside to leverage our oil price, such as a collar. And so a pure put hedge is pretty expensive. -- and then colors introduce an upside that limitation that we would like to put on our shareholders. And so if you look at the -- we think that creating that manageable debt profile, as I discussed in the comments, particularly knocking down the taller towers beyond just the near-term stuff that we focused on. If you look at the recent tender, 80% of the bonds that we addressed were in that 2022 to 2024 time frame.  And it's a more effective long-term solution by sending and provide that. 
And so I do think that you can use a trailing -- prices were to continue with the current strip values and use a trailing EBITDA by the end of the year. You could -- and we were able to continue on as we've been doing with [indiscernible] below a 3x multiple. But certainly, as I discussed, and that's not necessarily [indiscernible] -- that's the script value that's much higher than what's being used by the rating agencies. And so I do think it's important to us to maintain the ratios, but it's also why I mentioned my comments, it's important for us to really go after the maturities while we have the wind at our back in terms of commodity prices, which is exactly what we're doing. And so taking that out and continue to move forward. And then you can look at the way that we structure the tender and strategy approach on that, we left aside a significant amount of debt that's easily avail to us. $2 billion worth it's either going to be maturable at the end of the year, is callable for the new year, or we have an attractive make-whole payments in addition to the floating interest rate notes. 
And so that gives us access to very cheaply continue to retire debt moving forward over the balance of the year, which will go further and further towards that. And so we've just got work to do. We made a giant step forward with the debt tender in the last quarter. We see little work to do. But I do feel like that the work we've done, particularly between the deleveraging, and the [indiscernible] runway has made us give us a lot more selectivity around hedging strategies moving forward. Not to say that we would never do them again, but it certainly is going to -- certainly, our preference is to create the value for shareholders and give us the exposure to oil price, which is something that Oxy to offer right now that many others don't."

And as you know, Phil, it's a little early for us to forecast what 2022 looks like. We usually do that on our fourth quarter call. But to your point about cadence because I think that's relevant and you can kind of read some things into that. When you look at our capital profile, it's [ 2 9 ] for the year, as you mentioned, we spent [ 1 3 ] in the first half. And there's a couple of things that drive that, and you can see it. Like for example, our chems business, we forecasted about $300 million. They've spent a little over $100 million. So a lot of those activities are back-end weighted. On our Permian activity slide, you can see of our $1.2 billion, we've only spent $500 million of that. And the reason for that is a lot of our Midland Basin wells were front-end loaded. So much lower working interest with the carry. 
Now we're getting some of our higher working interest wells that go with that. So it's really more about where we're spending capital and how it is more than a cadence of an activity set drastically changing. So I wouldn't read into like a 800 quarter type number being what we need for next year. So as you look to 2022, I mean, obviously, we'd give a lot more color on this going forward. But I think the same narrative we've talked about in previous calls,  we continue to see great improvement from an operational standpoint. I think when you look at what our teams have done this year, it's exceeded all of our expectations, from an efficiency standpoint. I mean we -- every time we look to put the slides together, and we ask for new records have been set we're blown away by the new tons that come up again and again and again that our teams are doing. And so I don't think that's going to stop. I mean, we -- even after we put the slides together for this, we got notice last night, where our Rockies team set a record for the month of July for pumping efficiency of like 630 hours pumped. So you start doing the math on, and that's 10% better in our previous record in the best Western Hemisphere record for the service provider that did that. Halliburton. 
So I think we're going to continue to see those improvements that are going to help with capital efficiency going forward. And we do know there's takes against that, that we'll need to build in that we've talked about. GAM was especially low this year, and we know that probably takes a little more capital to run the type of business we want to run there. We've got other projects going on that could push that up, but those will be offset by some improvement. So -- More to come on that in the future. But I do think as we kind of roll that out, we will talk about some of the benefits and then some of the things that may cause us to spend a little more capital in the short term, but we definitely don't want to underestimate all the great things the teams are doing to get more efficient and get better results from the money that they spend. And I think that's what you saw in the first half of this year, is that rolling through and hence, why we connect add activity compared to what we thought without increasing the capital budget."

But we see that the incremental for an enhanced oil recovery will probably come closer to the time of the -- getting the first direct air capture facility online. We still have access to organic CO2, and we'll have minor increases as we continue to expand phases within the Permian EOR business significant improvement in escalation will come as a part of our low carbon strategy. and that will help to provide the low decline assets and production that we've been used to having in the past, which will help to offset some of the resources decline. 
So it's a key part of our low carbon strategy, and it will be a key contributor in growth engine for us as we go forward beyond the implementation of the first few tacks."

As Jeff said, I can't reiterate enough how they've blown us away with the work that they've done that is not just at steady state today. It's continuing to improve. As Jeff mentioned, the subsurface work goes beyond what I ever expected to see in the shale play. And they're now really pushing the technology envelope on how to model how to first evaluate do the data analytics and then model the surface production in the shale reservoirs and to know exactly where to land and how to frac and how to complete. You combine that with the fact that our drilling and completion guys are continuing to set records. 
And I tell you, Three years ago, we would not have predicted where we are today. And even last year, we wouldn't have predicted some of the things that are happening this year. That's why when we talk about capital in the future, it's really hard to say what our sustaining capital would be because we didn't expect it to be 2.9% this year back when we looked at it 18 months ago. So the progress made in pushing the envelope being innovative and really developing the leading edge part of the industry with respect to this kind of technology has been amazing.

Our strong operational performance in the second quarter continued to drive robust financial performance as we marked our second consecutive quarter of generating the highest level of free cash flow in over a",1305,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong operational performance in the second quarter continued to drive robust financial performance as we marked our second consecutive quarter of generating the highest level of free cash flow in over a decade. As was the case last quarter, our cost structure and capital intensity leadership were catalysts for our strong results and continue to provide a solid foundation for free cash flow generation in the future.
We were especially pleased to have been in a position at the end of the second quarter to launch a tender process to retire over $3 billion of debt using excess cash generated from operations as well as proceeds from divestitures. While we made incremental progress in reducing debt throughout 2020 in the first half of 2021, the completion of this tender represents a sizable step forward in our deleveraging efforts.
This morning, I'll cover our second quarter operational performance and divestiture progress, and Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our updated guidance, which includes an improvement to our DD&A rate, an increase in guidance for our full year production and for midstream and OxyChem's 2021 earnings.
In the second quarter, our business -- all of our businesses outperformed. Our capital discipline and efficiency, combined with the supportive and improving commodity price environment, positions us to generate the highest level of free cash flow before and after working capital since the third quarter of 2008 when WTI hit $145 a barrel.  We are proud of our teams for this accomplishment, and we appreciate that they are continuing to improve our capital execution and operating efficiencies to further expand our margins.
We exited the quarter with approximately $4.6 billion of unrestricted cash, which does not include cash received in July from the recently closed divestiture or the cash used for the debt tender which closed in July. Rob will touch on the under in a little more detail, but I would like to reiterate how pleased we are to be once again making notable progress in reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet.
Turning to our operational results. Our oil and gas business delivered second quarter production from continuing operations of over 1.2 million BOE per day, with total company-wide capital spending of almost $698 million. Our domestic oil and gas operating cost of $6 per BOE came in substantially below our full year guidance as our teams continued to demonstrate their innovative operations expertise by finding new ways to safely reduce costs in our field operations.
In the second quarter, OxyChem continued to benefit from robust PVC demand and pricing as well as gradual strengthening in the caustic soda market. We believe the fundamentals for these markets will remain supportive through the second half of 2021, and we are confident in increasing our full year guidance to a midpoint of $1.25 billion, representing an almost 60% increase over our original guidance for the year.
The ability of our oil and gas business to overcome challenges while increasing efficiencies has been transformational. Looking back over the first 6 months of this year, we overcame the impacts of a major weather event and divested a producing asset. We were able to make up the loss and divested production and have increased our full year production guidance for continuing operations to 1.15 million BOE per day.
We continue to be highly encouraged by well performance across our portfolio. For example, in the Texas Delaware, we recently brought online a new Silvertip development that is producing approximately 20% more oil compared to a prior development in this area. Additionally, in an area of roughly 10 miles southeast of Silvertip, we brought online a 5-well development with average 30-day peak rates of almost 5,000 BOE per day.
As I mentioned, operationally, our teams continue to set new efficiency records while constantly pursuing opportunities to improve. We set new quarterly records across our portfolio on feet drilled and hours pumped in a single day. In the Midland Basin, we set a new drilling record with over 9,500 feet drilled in 24 hours, contributing to a new Oxy Permian spud-to-rig-release record, drilling a 10,000-foot horizontal well in only 8 days.
In the DJ Basin, we set a new company-wide track record of pumping over 23 hours in a single day. Utilizing Oxy Drilling Dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico, we have significantly lowered drilling cost and duration as the well drilled in 2021 have cost 15% less than the average for 2019. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we've had excellent results leveraging remote operations. Our innovative mindset and ability to leverage technological breakthroughs have allowed us to continue pushing the performance envelope, giving me confidence that our best-in-class capital efficiency will continue.
Our divestiture plan advanced in the second quarter with the recent closing of a noncore Permian acreage sale for approximately $510 million. Given our industry-leading inventory depth, we welcome the opportunity to monetize these assets at an attractive price as it is unlikely that we would have developed this acreage in the near future. We expect to close at least $2 billion of divestitures post Colombia. And as we've said previously, we'll always prioritize obtaining value for our shareholders over meeting a deadline.
I want to take a few minutes to talk about our Chemical business and how we plan to leverage its leadership and expertise into our Low Carbon Ventures business. OxyChem's success is demonstrated by its financial performance and track record of consistent free cash flow generation. OxyChem has been a consistent generator of free cash flow during the past downturns. And with the macro environment improving, OxyChem is on track to deliver record earnings this year, even surpassing 2018's results. The business may also continue to strengthen in future years as caustic soda, one of the key profit drivers for the business, has experienced only a moderate price recovery to date.
Last quarter, I spoke about how OxyChem's integration across multiple chlorine derivatives provides us with the ability to optimize our caustic soda production while opportunistically adjusting our production mix to maximize margins. There are many opportunities for us to apply the same approach to integration as we develop opportunities between OxyChem and our Low Carbon Ventures business. As a major producer of PVC and caustic potash, OxyChem has the engineering, R&D and process technology expertise as well as the production capability necessary to build our Low Carbon business.
OxyChem is a world leader in the customization, handling and usage of PVC, which will be a major component in the construction and ongoing operation of the direct air capture facility. We're also one of the world's largest leading producers of caustic potash, the key chemical utilized in the direct air capture process to separate carbon dioxide for sequestration of carbon-neutral enhanced oil recovery. Our vast knowledge of equipment design and our experience with operating and handling the caustic potash will be key to helping us quickly optimize our direct air capture facility.
In addition to being a market leader and consistent free cash flow generator, OxyChem is integral to our business of today and of tomorrow. It's also worth noting that OxyChem is a market leader in health, safety and environmental performance. OxyChem recently earned a remarkable 31 Responsible Care awards. These are from the American Chemistry Council and are the U.S. chemical manufacturing industry's leading performance awards. The awards recognize OxyChem's achievements in safety, waste reduction and improving energy efficiency. Several of the award-winning initiatives focused on waste minimization, reuse, recycling and energy efficiency, which will all contribute to our 2025 sustainability goals.
I will now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the remainder of the year."

Our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter as our free cash flow generation affirmed our confidence in Oxy's ability to generate cash in a healthy price environment. The strong performance contributed to a quarter end",1128,"Thank you, Vicki. Our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter as our free cash flow generation affirmed our confidence in Oxy's ability to generate cash in a healthy price environment. The strong performance contributed to a quarter end unrestricted cash balance of $4.6 billion.
On our last call, I mentioned the potential for a partial reversal of the working capital change incurred in the first quarter. As expected, we benefited from a positive working capital change this quarter of approximately $600 million, further contributing to our cash build during the quarter. As Vicki mentioned, we launched a tender late in the quarter and enabled us to repay over $3 billion of debt in July. Subsequent to successful execution of a debt tender in July, we received proceeds from the nonstrategic Permian acreage, partially refreshing our post-tender cash position early in the quarter.
In the second quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $0.32 and a reported loss of $0.10 per diluted share. While we placed a greater importance on cash flow generation, especially as we are focused on deleveraging, we are pleased to be generating income on an adjusted basis. Indeed, this is a positive indication that our financial position continues to improve. Our reported results were less than our adjusted results primarily due to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives.
We delivered outstanding production results year-to-date while having deployed less than half of our full year capital budget of $2.9 billion. We expect capital expenditure to remain within budget, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and our capital intensity leadership, even as capital spending has been higher in the second half than the first half of the year.
The positive working capital change realized in the quarter was driven by lower cash payments for items that are accrued throughout the year and lower crude inventory from fewer barrels in the water, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance due to the increase in commodity prices. As the interest payments on our bonds are made semiannually, our cash interest payments are going to be lower in the second and fourth quarters than they are in the first and third quarters.
During the downturn last year, we received approximately $1 billion of additional cash flow from our oil hedges. To obtain a costless structure, we sold a 2021 call position of 350,000 barrels a day with an average strike price of $74.16 Brent. As the commodity prices rose at the end of the second quarter, we made payments of $5.7 million under the sold call position and $1 million under our gas hedges in July. Cash settlements paid to date on the hedges have been minimal and are certainly worth the benefit we received last year.
We continue to maintain an opportunistic approach towards hedging, and the forward curve is supportive but have not added any hedges past the end of this year. We believe creating a manageable debt maturity profile and reducing debt is a more effective long-term solution to derisking the balance sheet while providing shareholders with exposure to commodity price gains.
We raised our full year production guidance following our strong second quarter results and have increased our earnings guidance for OxyChem and midstream for the second time this year, reflecting strong first half performance and improved market conditions.
We expect that 2021 will be a record year for OxyChem, even surpassing our earnings in 2018. We benefit from exceptionally strong caustic soda prices in the middle part of that year. Midstream is expected to benefit in the second half of the year from continued higher sulfur prices at Al Hosn as well as an uplift in the third quarter related to the timing of export sales.
We also lowered our DD&A guidance for 2021, reflecting the midyear reserves update. This update takes into account more supportive trailing 12-month commodity prices at midyear compared to year-end 2020 as well as our activity plans and recent success in lowering operating costs. The combination of these factors have increased our proved reserves, which we expect to result in a lower DD&A rate going forward.
Our production in the second half of 2021 is expected to average 1.14 million BOE per day. Production in the second quarter benefited from time-to-market acceleration in the Rockies and Permian. Favorable weather conditions and optimization of planned maintenance schedules to better sequence shutdown activities resulted in lower-than-expected downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, contributing to higher-than-expected production.
Our expected third quarter production of 1.145 million BOE per day includes an allowance for seasonal weather and maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico, the divestiture of approximately 10,000 BOE per day in the Permian, the timing impact of our Rockies capital program, which was front-loaded in 2021 as well as PSC impact due to price. Even as production in the second half of the year is pretty lower than the impressive second quarter production results, we remain confident in our production trajectory leveling out as we enter 2022, where we anticipate a production pattern similar to 2021.
We have updated our activity slide to include 2 additional New Mexico rigs. The New Mexico activity change will be fully funded through the cost savings and optimization of our capital projects' gain through efficiency improvements and will not increase our capital budget.  Adding activity in one of our highest return to assets will place us in a strong position as we transition into 2022.
With the successful completion of our debt tender, we paid over $3 billion of 2022 through 2026 maturities and have a clear runway over the next few years. As we generate cash from organic free cash flow, we continue to value the options available for additional debt reduction, and we'll seek to further our debt maturity profile so that we're not exposed to any significant amount of maturities in any single year. The options available to us for debt reduction include potentially calling the 2022 floating rate notes prior to maturity, executing additional tenders, exercising attractive make-whole provisions, pursuing all the market debt repurchases, or we may choose, in some cases, to build a cash position which may be applied towards retiring maturities as they come due.
We also plan to retire $750 million of notional interest rate swaps in the third quarter for the fair value amount, which will improve cash flow by almost $50 million per annum at the current curve. We entered the second half of 2021 in a strong position at the beginning of the year, and as we look forward, we remain focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position, deleveraging to regain investment-grade metrics and preserving financial policies and cash flow priorities and embed capital discipline.
I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

We continue to see very strong conditions in both our vinyl business and steady improvements in the caustic soda business, as Vicki indicated.

We continue to see very strong conditions in both our vinyl business and steady improvements in the caustic soda business, as Vicki indicated. As you can see on Slide 7 of the deck, these 2 businesses are the major profit drivers for our Chemical business. And it's unusual, but we do have conditions when both businesses are seeing favorable market conditions, the earnings impact that you're seeing is significant. So on the PVC business, the business remains extremely strong due to a tight supply/demand balance.
On a year-to-date basis, we're seeing domestic demand as an industry about 16% higher compared to the same period in 2020. But more importantly, it's up 13% from where it was in 2019 in a non-COVID period. And so strong demand is also attributed to really low levels of inventory and supply chain, combined with the construction sector, which we're seeing in, obviously, in a lot of their construction materials.
And we expect demand to remain strong with a very favorable housing start outlook, mortgage rates remaining low, which tends to also drive historically the business and a lot of investment remodeling. And so we're -- those kind of factors are all pointing towards sustained improvement in the PVC business.
The other thing I would say is that when the export business is soft like it is now, where we're seeing year-to-date exports are down 33%, which tends to be the last location of PVC production, that's indicative of a strong market. And so when there's not enough product to go around, we shouldn't see margins remain favorable for us.
On the chlor-alkali side, the chlorine molecule itself is very tight, and so producers are seeking the highest-value outlets for chlorine molecules. And as Vicki mentioned, our very diverse portfolio of chlorine derivatives allows us to really maximize the bag of these chlorine molecules through our chain of opportunities. And so chlor-alkali production itself has been under pressure for the year simply because of a lot of both unplanned and planned outages. And if you look at chlor-alkali rates, they're actually lower in '21 than they were in '20 year-to-date, running about 75% year-to-date versus 80% over the same period last year, resulting in about 6% less caustic production available this year versus last year.
So caustic is quite tight, which is helping to improve prices. And with it playing out into the schedule in the third quarter, we would anticipate that -- further support for additional price increases in the caustic soda business. And then as you see, caustic for us tends to be something that moves with the global economy. And well, certainly, as economies open up and eventually travel restrictions close -- ease globally, we should see additional demand in underlying sectors. And so as far as the key demand sectors in the second half, we see better demand in the alumina sector, the pulp/paper sector, water treatment and certainly the leasing sectors all improving in the third quarter.
So both sides of the ECU are looking strong headed into the second half of the year. And the underlying factors certainly are bullish for both of them as we move into 2022 and beyond."

So certainly a topic du jour. So we depicted on the 13th slide of the deck, which was newly included, that we're essentially on a journey when it comes to cash flow priorities.

So we depicted on the 13th slide of the deck, which was newly included, that we're essentially on a journey when it comes to cash flow priorities. And after a lot of risk in 2020, to derisk the company in what I call a post-COVID world, between the stabilization of production, the slashing of our costs and refinance near-term maturities, now we're making headway, as Vicki detailed, on our deleveraging process. And we took a significant step forward with the upside tender in July, through both a combination of cash available, from strong production performance, the continued capital execution and diligent cost management and really the remarkable turnaround in Chemicals, all contributed to the success of that.
And so now we've retired about $12.7 billion of principal since the middle of '19 through that combination of our great cash generation and investor program. And I think we'll continue to work towards the $2 billion to $3 billion post-Colombia divesture target that we've established. But as we look forward, it's anticipated that the majority of free cash flow from the business will be the source of future cash for debt retirement. And it's critical that as we take advantage of the elevated prices, to deleverage the balance sheet because we know any time there are going to be changes in the macro environment that could affect or alter commodity prices, that it would inhibit our ability to do that.
So when I look at the time it takes, our path does remain focused right now on the 2 top priorities being that we're focused on in our list. And how long we're on that path is certainly dependent upon future commodity prices because that certainly impacts the rate at which we're able to move down the path. But I do think that the steps we've taken since March of '20 are all part of a long-term strategy around increasing value to our shareholders. For example, if you look at last year, in the derisking side, we could have saved a little interest in our refinance process by using more owners and ventures.
But we sit here today with a much less risky maturity profile and much in the same simple capital structure we started with. And we do believe ultimately deleveraging the company is going to be the benefit of equity holders in the form of equity appreciation. And we also understand that, that leverage to oil price remains attractive and is determined at the pace of that process.
And our EBITDA does fluctuate obviously a lot with commodity prices. And while some agencies have modestly increased their models, their prices are still well below the current strip. So that's why we keep saying that to get to a more sustainable debt level in the mid-20 range is likely necessary to achieve those ivy-like financial metrics.
In addition to debt ratio, we understand obviously financial policies matter and thus great decisions. So use of cash or dividends, growth, et cetera, will also be viewed in the near-term unfavorably, so that's why we remain focused on the deleveraging process. And once we reach that more sustainable debt level, we will start resuming a greater amount of cash to shareholders."

It's not meaningful value for our shareholders today.
So we're constantly looking at and updating, optimizing our plans and looking at those opportunities, where could there be additional situations where we have the same thing that we just did with this Permian acreage, monetize it today and have the opportunity to create better value today than to keep it in the portfolio when we know we can't get to it.

Because we started out the divestiture program by cutting off the very tail end of what we felt like fit within our portfolio, that could fit with another portfolio in a higher level.

I guess what I would like to maybe address, some of the metrics you're using that underpin the decision to move away from any sort of a hedging strategy and maybe getting back to thinking about from a debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-cap, maybe a long-term debt number you're more comfortable with, just maybe all the pieces that have gone into it that kind of speaks to where you are now versus where everything was 12 and 24 months ago."

So certainly, historically, the company has not been one with a hedging philosophy and felt like the combination of our exposure to commodities and exposure to the price of a long-haul would ultimately deliver the most value to",676,"Yes, fair question, Roger. So certainly, historically, the company has not been one with a hedging philosophy and felt like the combination of our exposure to commodities and exposure to the price of a long-haul would ultimately deliver the most value to our shareholders versus attempting to use hedges to try and create value. And that certainly changed in 2020 because we were in a position where our leverage was such that it was necessary for us to create some protection in the event we were in a negative price environment, like -- but it ultimately worked out that way.
And certainly, the $1 billion that we were able to create in value last year from the hedge was something that was critical to our success last year. And we'll continue to maintain the opportunistic approach. But as we evaluate hedges, we're considering a lot of factors. Number one is the cost to execute the hedge. Certainly, as a -- the cost of hedges that we did last year came with a call provision this year, which hasn't been very expensive, but they can be, and the implications that the hedge is going to have on the upside to leverage our oil price, such as a collar. And so a pure put hedge is pretty expensive. I think collars introduce an upside to that limitation that we would like to put on our shareholders.
And so if you look at the -- we think that creating that manageable debt profile, as I discussed in the comments, particularly knocking down the taller towers beyond just the near-term stuff that we focused on, if you look at the recent tender, 80% of the bonds that we addressed were in that 2022 to 2024 time frame.  And it's a more effective long-term solution by [ certainly providing ] that.
And so I do think that you can use a trailing -- if prices were to continue with the current strip values and use a trailing EBITDA by the end of the year, you could -- and we were able to continue on as we've been doing with debt retirement, would be easily be below a 3x multiple. But certainly, as I discussed, that's [ nothing necessarily that slipped in ] with a strip value that's much higher than the -- what's being used by the rating agencies.
And so I do think it's important to us to maintain those ratios, but it's also why I mentioned in my comments it's important for us to really go after the maturities while we have the wind at our back in terms of commodity prices, which is exactly what we're doing and so taking that out and continuing to move forward. And then you can look at the way that we structured the tender and strategy approach on that, we left aside a significant amount of debt that's easily available to us, $2 billion worth, it's either going to be maturable at the end of the year, is callable for the new year, or we have attractive make-whole payments in addition to the floating interest rate notes.
And so that gives us access to very cheaply continue to retire debt moving forward over the balance of the year, which will go further and further towards that. And so we've just got work to do. We made a giant step forward with the debt tender in the last quarter. But we see still have a little more work to do. But I do feel like that the work we've done, particularly between the deleveraging and the [ cleaned out ] runway has made us -- [ give us that ] -- a lot more selectivity around hedging strategies moving forward, not to say that we would never do them again, but it certainly [ is going to ] -- certainly, our preference is to create the value for shareholders and give [ them the exposure ] to oil price, which is something that Oxy has to offer right now that many others don't."

And the impact is really more about next year. If you look at that activity set, those -- one rig started up, another will start up soon, that -- it will add approximately 20,000 barrels a day to second quarter next year. So that will help our capital profile going into next year."

And as you know, Phil, it's a little early for us to forecast what 2022 looks like. We usually do that on our fourth quarter call. But to your point about cadence because I think that's relevant and you can kind of read some things into that, when you look at our capital profile, and that's $2.9 billion for the year, as you mentioned, we spent $1.3 billion in the first half. And there's a couple of things that drive that, and you can see it. Like for example, our Chems business, we forecasted about $300 million. They've spent a little over $100 million. So a lot of those activities are back-end-weighted.
On our Permian activity slide, you can see, of our $1.2 billion, we've only spent $500 million of that. And the reason for that is a lot of our Midland Basin wells were front-end-loaded, so much lower working interest with the carry. Now we're getting to some of our higher-working interest wells that go with that. So it's really more about where we're spending capital and how it is more than a cadence of an activity set drastically changing. So I wouldn't read into like a 800 quarter-type number being what we need for next year.
So as you look to 2022, I mean, obviously, we would give a lot more color on this going forward, but I think the same narrative we've talked about in previous calls, we continue to see great improvement from an operational standpoint. I think when you look at what our teams have done this year, it's exceeded all of our expectations from an efficiency standpoint. I mean we -- every time we look to put the slides together and we ask for new records that have been set, we're blown away by the new things that come up again and again and again that our teams are doing.
And so I don't think that's going to stop. I mean we -- even after we put the slides together for this, we got notice last night, where our Rockies team set a record for the month of July for pumping efficiency of like 630 hours pumped. So you start doing the math on that, and that's 10% better than our previous record and the best Western Hemisphere record for the service provider that did that in Halliburton.
So I think we're going to continue to see those improvements that are going to help with capital efficiency going forward. And we do know there's takes against that, that we'll need to build in, that we've talked about. GoM was especially low this year, and we know that probably takes a little more capital to run the type of business we want to run there. We've got other projects going on that could push that up, but those will be offset by some improvement.
So more to come on that in the future. But I do think, as we kind of roll that out, we will talk about some of the benefits and then some of the things that may cause us to spend a little more capital in the short term. But we definitely don't want to underestimate all the great things the teams are doing to get more efficient and get better results from the money that they spend. And I think that's what you saw in the first half of this year, is that rolling through and hence, why we could add activity compared to what we thought without increasing the capital budget."

But we see that the incremental for Enhanced Oil Recovery will probably come closer to the time of the -- getting the first direct air capture facility online. We still have access to organic CO2, and we'll have minor increases as we continue to expand phases within the Permian EOR business. But significant improvement in escalation will come as a part of our low carbon strategy, and that will help to provide the low-decline assets and production that we've been used to having in the past, which will help to offset some of the resources' decline.

We actually may look at additional JVs in the Delaware Basin to continue to accelerate what we're doing there. And partnering with others where we can join forces and find ways to obtain synergies and to utilize our team to -- for the execution part of it and the evaluation part, I think is a really good idea because I'm so proud of our teams.
As Jeff said, I can't reiterate enough how they've blown us away with the work that they've done that is not just at steady-state today, it's continuing to improve. As Jeff mentioned, the subsurface work goes beyond what I ever expected to see in the shale play. And they're now really pushing the technology envelope on how to model, how to first evaluate, do the data analytics and then model the surface production in the shale reservoirs and to know exactly where to land and how to frac and how to complete. You combine that with the fact that our drilling and completion guys are continuing to set records.
And I tell you, 3 years ago, we would not have predicted where we are today. And even last year, we wouldn't have predicted some of the things that are happening this year. That's why when we talk about capital in the future, it's really hard to say what our sustaining capital would be because we didn't expect it to be $2.9 billion this year back when we looked at it 18 months ago. So the progress made in pushing the envelope, being innovative and really developing the leading-edge part of the industry, with respect to this kind of technology, has been amazing.

So the one that we're going to build will be the largest direct share capture facility in the world. Currently, there are a couple of other different technologies that can capture CO2 from the air.

So -- and it should be then online toward the end of 2023 or into 2024. So it will be up and running certainly by 2024. The process around what we're doing to ensure that we get the right funding for it is we have been talking with partners. And so we have multiple opportunities to bring in others who want to be a part of this.
United Airlines has announced that they will be a part of our direct air capture facility. So they will be not only contributing to the capital needed to build it, but they will be taking the fuel from the facility. So they are committing to an offtake of the low carbon fuel that will be provided by the CO2 that's captured from the air.
So there are multiple ways to fund it. So one is to making investment in the facility itself. Second is to commit to taking the CO2 credits. Third is to commit to purchasing the oil that's generated from the CO2 that goes into Enhanced Oil Recovery. So we have several ways of financing the facility. And so it's -- we haven't finalized how we'll do that. We're working through that now and talking to a lot of interested parties. We should have more information on how we're going to do that by early next year.
But it's -- there's definitely a lot of interest in making this happen. It's for the U.S. and for the world. Direct air capture needs to happen successfully and happen in a big way. And so that's generating the interest in the parties that want to be contributing to it and then get to participate in the results of it."

Our strong operational and financial performance continued in the third quarter. Consistent with prior quarters this year, we generated a record level of free cash flow before working capital, which we apply",1425,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong operational and financial performance continued in the third quarter. Consistent with prior quarters this year, we generated a record level of free cash flow before working capital, which we apply towards reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. Operationally, our business has excelled driving our robust financial performance. OxyChem had its strongest quarter in over 30 years in our Permian, Rockies, Gulf of Mexico and Oman teams, set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks. As was the case last quarter, our cost structure and capital intensity leadership served as catalysts for our strong financial results and provided a solid foundation for free cash flow generation. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and OxyChem operations were impacted during this quarter by Hurricane Ida. Our primary focus was the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors, and we were relieved to hear that our people remained safe during the storm. We are working closely with those that were impacted, and I could not have been more pleased with how our teams overcame the challenging events triggered by the storm. The Gulf of Mexico and OxyChem operations that were affected by Ida are back online with no lasting impacts. I'd also like to pass along our best wishes to our coworkers in Oman's capital of Muscat and to all the people of Oman as they recover from the devastation recently caused by Cyclone Shaheen. 
This morning, I'll cover our third quarter operational performance and divestiture progress, Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our fourth quarter guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year includes an increase in production and an improvement to earnings guidance for Midstream and OxyChem. 
The commodity price environment continued to be supportive in the third quarter as our focus remained on generating free cash flow and maximizing margins. This is the third consecutive quarter that our operational success and capital intensity leadership have produced a record level of free cash flow. In fact, our third quarter free cash flow was the highest it's been since at least the turn of the century. As you know, that time frame included several periods of significantly higher oil prices. 
Total production for the quarter reached the high end of our guidance, which is a noteworthy accomplishment considering the extended downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Ida's impact on third quarter production and the costs associated with safely shutting in production, evacuating and then restarting the platforms and ongoing projects resulted in higher-than-expected domestic operating costs for the quarter. Our fourth quarter domestic operating cost guidance reflects normalized conditions and is relatively in line with our previous expectations for the year. 
On our last earnings call, we highlighted OxyChem's many strengths and consistent free cash flow generation. OxyChem's third quarter earnings were the strongest since 1990 and are a great example of what the business is capable of delivering. While Hurricane Ida disrupted third quarter operations, the impact to OxyChem's Louisiana-based facilities was temporary. The storm reduced production capacity in the period when market inventories were already fairly tight by historical standards. 
OxyChem continued to benefit from supportive TBC and caustic pricing resulting in a stronger-than-anticipated earnings. Our Midstream and marketing business benefited from the timing of export sales during a rising crude price environment and a healthy market for the sulfur produced at Al Hosn. The marketing team was able to capitalize on natural gas price volatility during the quarter by directing gas towards transportation solutions, yielding the high spreads. In summary, our team was once again able to utilize existing contracts and their expertise to maximize margins by delivering product to the markets that needed it the most. 
We continue to make notable progress in reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. We exited the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash following the repayment of $4.3 billion of debt and the settlement of $750 million of notional interest rate swaps. We are pleased to have delivered such a sizable reduction in debt in a single quarter. In a healthy commodity price environment, we expect to continue reducing debt in future quarters as we delever and take the necessary steps to move towards returning additional capital to shareholders. 
Our oil and gas teams continued to demonstrate a consistent drive for efficiency as we never tire of setting new operational records or generating record levels of free cash flow. I continue to be impressed by how our global teams are able to deliver outstanding results. And I want to highlight several of the examples of operational excellence in the third quarter. 
I'll start in the Permian, where we drilled our first 15,000-foot lateral wells in the Midland Basin and did so with impressive results. One of the first wells was delivered in less than 10 days from spud to rig release. In the Delaware Basin, year-to-date, we're drilling 16% faster than we were just a year ago. The efficiency gains that our teams are recording extend well beyond the Permian. Our Rockies teams set a new Oxy daily drilling record in the DJ Basin with over 9,700 feet drilled in 24 hours. In the Gulf of Mexico, we set a new cycle time drilling record, and our hosting platform achieved a size production in 10 years. In Oman, we set new multiple drilling records and completions efficiency records as our teams continued to leverage new technologies and drilling techniques to improve performance. 
Another significant milestone reached by our international business was Dolphin, delivering its tenth Tcf of natural gas in the third quarter. The impressive efficiency gains we have highlighted on the last few earnings calls are translating into tangible financial results. Our innovative approach to drilling and completion techniques, coupled with supply chain optimization, will enable us to deliver higher production than initially planned this year. And I want to point out, we're accomplishing this all while maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. 
We continuously seek new ways to work with our partners to lower cost in a socially and environmentally responsible way, and we're pleased to have been able to do that in the third quarter. Through our partnership with a leading midstream company, we increased by about 30% the capacity of the water recycling plant that supports our Midland Basin, South Curtis Ranch development. This expansion has enabled us to recycle and utilize higher volumes of water from the plant. In addition to lowering costs, we have not disposed of any water at the South Curtis Ranch development since August. 
Across our U.S. onshore assets, our transition to using dual fuel frac fleets and drilling rigs has saved over 6 million gallons of diesel year-to-date, lowering cost and reducing emissions. And Colorado's new permitting process became effective at the beginning of this year, we worked closely with regulators to adapt to the new process and requirements. As members of the communities where we operate, our goal is to serve as a resource and educate stakeholders on Oxy's approach to responsible development. Our inclusive approach has been helpful in securing DJ permits. In September, we were pleased to see the process move forward for Oxy with the approval of additional permits in [ Weld ] County. Our engagement with and support from communities remains strong, as does our commitment to responsible development as we work to secure additional permits. The momentum that our oil and gas business has generated throughout 2021 has helped position us for a strong start in 2022. 
We recently completed our large-scale divestiture program with the sale of our Ghana assets for $750 million. As many of you know, we have been working closely with our partners in Ghana to complete this divestiture and  have successfully closed the transactions with both buyers. For the Ghana divestiture, we have completed our goal of divesting $2 billion to $3 billion post Colombia, marking the end of our large-scale ongoing divestiture program. We have now divested approximately $10 billion of assets since August of 2019, and including the debt that was repaid in the third quarter, we have repaid approximately $14 billion of debt. 
As we maintain our focus on shareholder value, we'll continue to seek opportunities to optimize our portfolio. We will continue to complete acreage trades or bolt-on acquisitions if they create value for our shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter."

In the third quarter, we generated a record level of free cash flow as commodity prices remained healthy and our businesses performed well.

In the third quarter, we generated a record level of free cash flow as commodity prices remained healthy and our businesses performed well. We exited the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet after repaying $4.3 billion of debt in the quarter. Through September 30, we have repaid $4.5 billion of debt and retired $750 million of notional interest rate swaps. We estimate this will reduce interest and financing costs by $170 million per year going forward. 
Our consistently strong operational results, in combination with current commodity price environment, are driving improved profitability on top of our already robust free cash flow generation. In the third quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $0.87 and a reported profit of $0.65 per diluted share, following on a return to profitability on an adjusted basis in the second quarter. Similar to previous quarters this year, our reported results were less than our adjusted results primarily due to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives. 
As commodity prices improved throughout the third quarter, we made payments of $14.2 million on the remaining oil hedge position and $24.1 million under our gas hedges. We recognize that shareholders appreciate our leveraged oil prices. and the recent uplift of natural gas prices. Our current oil and gas hedges will expire by the end of this year, and we have not added any new hedges for future periods. 
As Vicki mentioned, the sale of our Ghana asset marks the completion of our large-scale divestiture program. These assets were classified as discontinued operations around financial statements, so there will be no impact on ongoing production. We will apply the cash from this divestiture and any cash to generate from future portfolio optimization  to our cash flow priorities, which are currently focused on reducing debt. 
We have raised our full year production guidance to 1.155 million BOE per day for 2021, while our full year capital guidance of $2.9 billion remains unchanged. Last quarter, we raised our full year production guidance shortly before Hurricane Ida temporarily disrupted our Gulf of Mexico production. Even taking into account the impact of this sizable storm, we met the high end of our company-wide production guidance for the third quarter. 
Our fourth quarter capital spend is expected to be higher than prior quarter this year primarily due to the timing of maintenance activities in all 3 of our business segments. In oil and gas, for example, a portion of the capital spending in the Gulf of Mexico was moved from the third to the fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ida, and we plan to let the start of 2 rigs in the Permian, which I'll touch on shortly. 
Company-wide fourth quarter production is expected to be 1.14 million BOE per day, which represents a 5,000 per day increase from the guidance provided on our last call. Our fourth quarter guidance, which is slightly lower than our third quarter results, takes into account production sharing contract price sensitivities, planned maintenance and our activity schedules. We expect to exit 2021 at approximately the same average quarter production as we exit 2020 with. 
We have updated our activity slide to include 2 additional Permian rigs that were originally scheduled to start early next year and will now begin operating in the fourth quarter in the Texas Delaware and New Mexico. Similar to activity change we announced last quarter, this adjustment will be fully funded through cost savings and optimization of capital projects came to efficiency improvements and will not increase our 2021 capital budget. 
Texas Delaware and New Mexico are 2 of our highest return assets, and introducing activity in the fourth quarter will place us in a stronger position for 2022. We expect that the market dynamics, which drove Midstream and marketing performance in the third quarter, will continue in the fourth quarter. We have increased forward guidance to reflect improved differentials benefiting the gas marketing business and robust sulfur pricing at Al Hosn. 
We have increased earnings guidance for OxyChem for the third time this year, reflecting year-to-date performance and continued strong product demand. Not only do we expect 2021 to be a record year for OxyChem. We also anticipate the fourth quarter will be even stronger than the record third quarter. 
We believe that the market recognizes and appreciates the value being delivered to shareholders through debt reduction and balance sheet improvement. As we work to pay additional debt, we expect that shareholders will continue to benefit in several key ways. First, we expect that the additional debt reduction will translate into share price appreciation. We acknowledge that healthy commodity prices have played a role in the improvement of Oxy's enterprise value over the last 18 months. Assuming the enterprise value our company remains stable or improves, equity will become a larger portion of enterprise value over time as debt is reduced. 
The interest and financing costs saved on a go-forward basis lowers our cash flow breakeven. We expected the lower cash flow breakeven will result in additional discretionary cash being available to allocate towards our future cash flow priorities, including returning capital to shareholders. As we stated previously, we want to ensure that returning additional capital to shareholders, including any increase in the dividend, is sustainable and ratable throughout the cycle. Reducing the amount of cash committed to interest payments today places us in a stronger position for the sustainable return of capital in the future. 
Finally, lowering fixed costs in the form of interest or interest rate swap payments improves our flexible and optionalities at any point in the commodity cycle. Our balance sheet improvement efforts have placed us with a clear runway for the next few years, and we are taking a thoughtful approach to repaying additional debt in a manner that is opportunistic for Oxy. Executing additional tenders or exercising attractive make-whole provisions are just 2 of the solutions we are considering. We may also choose to retire the remaining interest rate swaps, which have an uncollateralized value of approximately $400 million and could be another opportunity to improve cash flow by approximately $45 million per year at the current interest rate curve. As we advance our cash flow priorities, we expect Oxy's financial position to strengthen, aided by our deleveraging efforts and our strong liquidity position. 
As we near the end of 2021, we are preparing for the year ahead with the underlying focus on safe, responsible operations and financial discipline, which we believe will create value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

We think that, that, that's going to be needed for the energy transition. And we're actually filling a gap with what we're doing, as you know, with respect to what others are doing. Every -- there's a lot that really needs to happen in this energy transition for us to be successful to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees. 
So there are some companies in the oil and gas industry that are moving more towards renewables, and that's very much needed. And there's -- there are others that are working very hard to mitigate all of their emissions from current operations. We're working on both of those but not the renewables. 
We're working on reducing our current emissions from ongoing operations but we're also, as you know, taking advantage of the core competence we have with CO2 and the handling of CO2 will enhance ore recovery. So we believe that that's a gap that nobody else is selling. 
And the reason that gap is necessary is for several reasons. First of all, there has to be CO2 removed from the atmosphere. There's nobody in the world that disputes that. So direct air capture is going to be critical for that to happen. So with direct air capture, not only can we remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but also that helps us to develop and produce oil that's either net zero or net negative carbon. So that enables us to provide the hard to decarbonize industry, such as aviation or maritime with fuels that are our net zero carbon. 
So there are 2 reasons to build direct air capture, first of all, for the removal from the atmosphere, the provision for providing those net zero carbon fuels. And the things that makes it very versatile is you can build it anywhere. So we think that because of the magnitude of that impact around the world and the need for thousands of these to be built, it provides us the opportunity to be a big part of that and to actually be a leader in developing the technology. So we think we will transition the transition will take some time. But over the next 10 to 15 years, I think we'll make a lot of progress towards becoming a carbon management company and a go-to company for those that need the CO2 offsets."

I've got a couple of questions, specifically around the return of cash comments. And if you don't -- if you can indulge me for a minute, I'd like to kind of lay out my thinking here. Your share price is lagging pretty badly today despite extraordinary free cash flow yield in our numbers and a clear line of sight to deleveraging. So there's something the market is not acknowledging, obviously. 
And our feedback, I guess, is that you're the only company not giving meaningful cash returns back to investors. So my question is, how do you think about the right level or the appropriate mechanism to return cash when your stock has such a high free cash flow yield. Let's assume that persists. That's my first question. 
And my second question is pioneering NOG, one1 has practically no net debt. The other is targeting no net debt. Where do you think the right level of debt is once you surpass your $25 billion target? Where do you want it to be? So first question, the mechanism for cash returns. Second question, the long-term mid-cycle appropriate level of your balance sheet."

I think we've talked about it over the last couple of years that we feel like it's very important to keep our breakeven around $40. So as we establish a fixed dividend and move forward, we would grow our cash flow to match the growth in the dividend rate. So that it will happen, and it will happen over time. 
With respect to other considerations for the use of cash, it will really depend on the circumstances that we're in when we actually have reestablished or actually grown the existing fixed dividend that we have."

And if it continues that way, it's not that far away that we'll reach that target. But we aren't there yet, and that's the reason why we're not increasing value returned to shareholders because we're sticking to our messaging and the plan we've set out in front of our shareholders. And so for us to prematurely deviate from that plan, bringing inconsistency to that message, we certainly don't want to bring to the marketplace."

Our teams have worked hard to try to establish the right kind of contracts and business situations with service providers and materials providers to mitigate inflation. We don't think necessarily we would mitigate all of it. We're just not sure right now what inflation will be. But we know that our efficiencies and our established relationships and business situations will help to mitigate some of it. We're hoping to continue also to further improve our efficiency so that we can mitigate more than what we would see today. But that's -- there's a lot of work going on around that and especially with respect to how we manage our supply chain and the strength of our position not only in the U.S. but around the world. So we're leveraging that as well. 
With respect to the sustainability capital, I will say that inflation, whatever amount we can't mitigate would be certainly on top of what we have today. And the only thing that I could really point to in terms of what we've said before about this is, in 2022, we won't have as many DUCs to complete as we did in 2021. So there's a difference there. We completed about 100 DUCs this year. In addition to that, we're going to have some capital investment that we'll need to make in 2 other areas.  both of which we mentioned before. Al Hosn, we'll begin the expansion of that in 2022. So we'll have that cost. We'll also have some incremental cost in the Gulf of Mexico. So it will be higher than the $300 million we had this year because the Gulf is a little bit lumpy in terms of capital investments. So we'll have those things to consider when we are putting together our final plan for 2022."

So Oman is important to us from that respect. And we do have a low cost of development there, and we get our cash back fairly quickly. So that's the good part of Oman. It delivers good returns. And Al Hosn is a low decline asset for us. So it plays that role. We want to continue building on our low-decline assets, but that will be -- a lot of the growth for that will be going back to EOR at some point to start building there as we get the -- CO2.

And so I'm not saying that we would never do it or never consider it. We're just not at the point now where we have all the data to be able to make that assessment. 
For example, today, we're not at $25 billion net debt. Now when we get there, we will take a look at all the things that are available to us to do. But starting to grow the dividend we have today is a high priority because of the fact that we did have to reduce it significantly when we want to start restoring it.

So I would say what we see today in the chemical business is still very strong conditions in our vinyl business and steady improvements in the caustic business. And you're correct. Typically, we're normally entering into a seasonally slower period of time. But we're just not seeing that thus far because if you step back and look at the year, the industry, which already was pretty tight on supply to begin the year, lost almost 2 months of production because of the freeze we had in the Gulf states in February and then the impact of Ida that we had in the third quarter. So the combination of those 2 has kept -- coupled with the demand being as strong as over all our products has kept the supply-demand balance much tighter than anticipated or typically historically -- the year. 
Those are the 2 main drivers. On Slide 31 of the deck, we include. Obviously, the main profit drivers for the business and the earnings are going to come from both the PBC business and the caustic soda business. The operating rates year-to-date are over 80% in the PVC business despite the impacts of the 2 storms in the last months of production. And domestic demand is up over 13% versus this time year-to-date last year. And that's even when we started picking up the demand post COVID last year. 
The other thing I would say is that the construction sector, much like it is other building products remains very strong with inventory levels still very low. And you can tell that inventories are very tight because exports are really soft still compared to historical levels. And what you have is with exports being down over 1/3 versus prior year, even prior being a COVID year, that's because the discretionary of resin is just not available. And so what you only exported PVC resin is really destined for long-term contractual sales from U.S.-based producers have relationships overseas. And you're not seeing that spot resin flow in the market, which means people are still just trying to get enough resin for the domestic market, which is going to keep prices elevated and margins elevated through that period of time. And so that's kind of atypical for this time of the year, but we do see it continuing through the balance of the year. 
Does it continue all into the winter? Construction necessarily has to slow during the winter, but we don't have a flavor for is how much are people going to want to restock inventories to be ready for what looks like another strong spring construction set, which will return pretty early in the year next year. 
On the chlor-alkali side, I'd say chlorine is extremely tight producers are still trying to seek the highest value for the outlet. This is where OxyChem's vast portfolio of derivatives gives us so much strength versus many others because -- We're not just making PVC. We're making all 3 parts of the Vinyls chain. We're also selling into a domestic market that gives us exposure to the polyurethane markets, the TiO2 markets, et cetera, and water -- beyond just water treatment and others traditionally think of in our own chloromethanes business. 
And so all those we're seeing strong demand and supply/demand balances are very tight. And we will see more than likely in the backside of another difficult operating year in the industry and continued effort to rebuild inventories, not only in supply chain. But there's also -- we're seeing a lot of pent-up demand still coming back as things somewhat return to normal on the backside of the pandemic. Particularly, caustic soda demand globally will continue to improve as manufacturing activity is restored in both South America and Asia and Europe. 
And so what we're seeing on the caustic side is, again, steady improvements where we're not seeing record prices on caustic soda like we are in PVC, but some of the prices in and Asia have risen to levels that haven't been seen before. And so both businesses are very strong right now. We will see a seasonal slowdown in caustic domestically because you're no longer able to transport caustic up the Mississippi River for the winter, but we don't see it really impacting the industry enough just because inventories are so tight. And so I still think January, February will continue to be slower months for the industry but it's going to be such a narrow period with the tight inventories. We'll probably hit the ground running pretty quick in this spring again."

We'll share more information as we get there about what our next target would be with respect to debt reduction. And then again, it's to start growing our dividend again. 
And the only point at which we would really need to start growing our production would be down the road, where we want to continue growing the dividend. We don't need additional growth from production right now to be able to increase the dividend over the next couple of years because, again, with what we expect the macro to be and the level of increase in our dividend, we believe that we can do that without any production growth over the next at least couple of years. 
So it would be continuing to maintain our operations, our production level. And then these occasional projects that are beyond the sustainability capital, like -- Al Hosn could be those over the next couple of years. But other than that, it's then going to the dividend and further debt reduction."

It has to happen. So the only way that it can happen and at the pace that's needed for the world is for the U.S. to get on board with supporting it, and the U.S. has the strength and the capability to do that. And the best way to do it is through 45Q and direct pay 45Q. 
So you're right on that, that's incredibly important to us. Otherwise, the U.S. will not achieve the targets that we've set with even the prior Paris accord, much less what's happening in Glasgow right now. So 45Q has to happen and really needs to be direct pay. Otherwise, we're going to struggle to be successful. But with respect to what we're doing, there is going to be a price for carbon because there's a lot of commitment from corporations now to get to net neutral. 
Everybody, I think, realizes at some point that if we don't achieve our goals through the incentives like 45Q, and there's going to have to be some price mechanism on carbon to make it happen. And so what we're seeing is a lot of corporations are trying to get ahead of that. A lot of corporations are starting to fill. Just see that there's a social license to operate in that -- to have that, there has -- they have to proactively start seeking CO2 credit offsets to become net neutral. United has been one, as you know, that we've announced that wants to do that, and they're proactively committing to dollars to the building of the direct air capture plus, the purchase of the  oil that would be the net zero oil. 
Other corporations are calling us. We're getting a lot of incoming interest in the direct air capture because of that. So I do believe that  there's going to be sufficient growth and commitment to make what we're doing here in the next -- in the initial phases work. But beyond that, again, what it's going to require is a much more acceleration than that."

Our strong operational and financial performance continued in the third quarter. Consistent with prior quarters this year, we generated a record level of free cash flow before working capital, which we apply",1423,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong operational and financial performance continued in the third quarter. Consistent with prior quarters this year, we generated a record level of free cash flow before working capital, which we apply towards reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. 
Operationally, our business has excelled driving our robust financial performance. OxyChem had its strongest quarter in over 30 years in our Permian, Rockies, Gulf of Mexico and Oman teams, set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks. As was the case last quarter, our cost structure and capital intensity leadership served as catalysts for our strong financial results and provided a solid foundation for free cash flow generation. 
Our Gulf of Mexico and OxyChem operations were impacted during this quarter by Hurricane Ida. Our primary focus was the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors, and we were relieved to hear that our people remained safe during the storm. We are working closely with those that were impacted, and I could not have been more pleased with how our teams overcame the challenging events triggered by the storm. 
The Gulf of Mexico and OxyChem operations that were affected by Ida are back online with no lasting impacts. I'd also like to pass along our best wishes to our coworkers in Oman's capital of Muscat and to all the people of Oman as they recover from the devastation recently caused by Cyclone Shaheen. 
This morning, I'll cover our third quarter operational performance and divestiture progress, Rob will cover our financial results and balance sheet improvement as well as our fourth quarter guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year includes an increase in production and an improvement to earnings guidance for Midstream and OxyChem. 
The commodity price environment continued to be supportive in the third quarter as our focus remained on generating free cash flow and maximizing margins. This is the third consecutive quarter that our operational success and capital intensity leadership have produced a record level of free cash flow. In fact, our third quarter free cash flow was the highest it's been since at least the turn of the century. As you know, that time frame included several periods of significantly higher oil prices. 
Total production for the quarter reached the high end of our guidance, which is a noteworthy accomplishment considering the extended downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Ida's impact on third quarter production and the costs associated with safely shutting in production, evacuating and then restarting the platforms and ongoing projects resulted in higher-than-expected domestic operating costs for the quarter. Our fourth quarter domestic operating cost guidance reflects normalized conditions and is relatively in line with our previous expectations for the year. 
On our last earnings call, we highlighted OxyChem's many strengths and consistent free cash flow generation. OxyChem's third quarter earnings were the strongest since 1990 and are a great example of what the business is capable of delivering. While Hurricane Ida disrupted third quarter operations, the impact to OxyChem's Louisiana-based facilities was temporary. The storm reduced production capacity in the period when market inventories were already fairly tight by historical standards. 
OxyChem continued to benefit from supportive PVC and caustic pricing resulting in a stronger-than-anticipated earnings. Our Midstream and marketing business benefited from the timing of export sales during a rising crude price environment and a healthy market for the sulfur produced at Al Hosn. The marketing team was able to capitalize on natural gas price volatility during the quarter by directing gas towards transportation solutions, yielding the high spreads. In summary, our team was once again able to utilize existing contracts and their expertise to maximize margins by delivering product to the markets that needed it the most. 
We continue to make notable progress in reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet. We exited the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash following the repayment of $4.3 billion of debt and the settlement of $750 million of notional interest rate swaps. We are pleased to have delivered such a sizable reduction in debt in a single quarter. In a healthy commodity price environment, we expect to continue reducing debt in future quarters as we delever and take the necessary steps to move towards returning additional capital to shareholders. 
Our oil and gas teams continued to demonstrate a consistent drive for efficiency as we never tire of setting new operational records or generating record levels of free cash flow. I continue to be impressed by how our global teams are able to deliver outstanding results. And I want to highlight several of the examples of operational excellence in the third quarter. 
I'll start in the Permian, where we drilled our first 15,000-foot lateral wells in the Midland Basin and did so with impressive results. One of the first wells was delivered in less than 10 days from spud to rig release. In the Delaware Basin, year-to-date, we're drilling 16% faster than we were just a year ago. The efficiency gains that our teams are recording extend well beyond the Permian. Our Rockies teams set a new Oxy daily drilling record in the DJ Basin with over 9,700 feet drilled in 24 hours. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we set a new cycle time drilling record, and our hosting platform achieved a size production in 10 years. In Oman, we set new multiple drilling records and completions efficiency records as our teams continued to leverage new technologies and drilling techniques to improve performance. 
Another significant milestone reached by our international business was Dolphin, delivering its tenth Tcf of natural gas in the third quarter. The impressive efficiency gains we have highlighted on the last few earnings calls are translating into tangible financial results. Our innovative approach to drilling and completion techniques, coupled with supply chain optimization, will enable us to deliver higher production than initially planned this year. And I want to point out, we're accomplishing this all while maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. 
We continuously seek new ways to work with our partners to lower cost in a socially and environmentally responsible way, and we're pleased to have been able to do that in the third quarter. Through our partnership with a leading midstream company, we increased by about 30% the capacity of the water recycling plant that supports our Midland Basin, South Curtis Ranch development. This expansion has enabled us to recycle and utilize higher volumes of water from the plant. In addition to lowering costs, we have not disposed of any water at the South Curtis Ranch development since August. 
Across our U.S. onshore assets, our transition to using dual fuel frac fleets and drilling rigs has saved over 6 million gallons of diesel year-to-date, lowering cost and reducing emissions. And Colorado's new permitting process became effective at the beginning of this year, we worked closely with regulators to adapt to the new process and requirements. As members of the communities where we operate, our goal is to serve as a resource and educate stakeholders on Oxy's approach to responsible development. 
Our inclusive approach has been helpful in securing DJ permits. In September, we were pleased to see the process move forward for Oxy with the approval of additional permits in Weld County. Our engagement with and support from communities remains strong, as does our commitment to responsible development as we work to secure additional permits. The momentum that our oil and gas business has generated throughout 2021 has helped position us for a strong start in 2022. 
We recently completed our large-scale divestiture program with the sale of our Ghana assets for $750 million. As many of you know, we have been working closely with our partners in Ghana to complete this divestiture and  have successfully closed the transactions with both buyers. For the Ghana divestiture, we have completed our goal of divesting $2 billion to $3 billion post Colombia, marking the end of our large-scale ongoing divestiture program. We have now divested approximately $10 billion of assets since August of 2019, and including the debt that was repaid in the third quarter, we have repaid approximately $14 billion of debt. 
As we maintain our focus on shareholder value, we'll continue to seek opportunities to optimize our portfolio. We will continue to complete acreage trades or bolt-on acquisitions if they create value for our shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our financial results for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter."

In the third quarter, we generated a record level of free cash flow as commodity prices remained healthy and our businesses performed well. We exited the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance s",1101,"Thank you, Vicki. In the third quarter, we generated a record level of free cash flow as commodity prices remained healthy and our businesses performed well. We exited the third quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet after repaying $4.3 billion of debt in the quarter. Through September 30, we have repaid $4.5 billion of debt and retired $750 million of notional interest rate swaps. We estimate this will reduce interest and financing costs by $170 million per year going forward. 
Our consistently strong operational results, in combination with current commodity price environment, are driving improved profitability on top of our already robust free cash flow generation. In the third quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $0.87 and a reported profit of $0.65 per diluted share, following on a return to profitability on an adjusted basis in the second quarter. Similar to previous quarters this year, our reported results were less than our adjusted results primarily due to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives. 
As commodity prices improved throughout the third quarter, we made payments of $14.2 million on the remaining oil hedge position and $24.1 million under our gas hedges. We recognize that shareholders appreciate our leveraged oil prices, and the recent uplift in natural gas prices. Our current oil and gas hedges will expire by the end of this year, and we have not added any new hedges for future periods. 
As Vicki mentioned, the sale of our Ghana asset marks the completion of our large-scale divestiture program. These assets were classified as discontinued operations around financial statements, so there will be no impact on ongoing production. We will apply the cash from this divestiture and any cash to generate from future portfolio optimization  towards our cash flow priorities, which are currently focused on reducing debt. 
We have raised our full year production guidance to 1.155 million BOE per day for 2021, while our full year capital guidance of $2.9 billion remains unchanged. Last quarter, we raised our full year production guidance shortly before Hurricane Ida temporarily disrupted our Gulf of Mexico production. Even taking into account the impact of this sizable storm, we met the high end of our company-wide production guidance for the third quarter. 
Our fourth quarter capital spend is expected to be higher than prior quarter this year primarily due to the timing of maintenance activities in all 3 of our business segments. In oil and gas, for example, a portion of the capital spending in the Gulf of Mexico was moved from the third to the fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ida, and we plan to accelerate the start of 2 rigs in the Permian, which I'll touch on shortly. 
Company-wide fourth quarter production is expected to be 1.14 million BOE per day, which represents a 5,000 BOE per day increase from the guidance provided on our last call. Our fourth quarter guidance, which is slightly lower than our third quarter results, takes into account production sharing contract price sensitivities, planned maintenance and our activity schedules. We expect to exit 2021 at approximately the same average quarter production as we exit 2020 with. 
We have updated our activity slide to include 2 additional Permian rigs that were originally scheduled to start early next year and will now begin operating in the fourth quarter in the Texas Delaware and New Mexico. Similar to the activity change we announced last quarter, this adjustment will be fully funded through cost savings and optimization of capital projects gained through efficiency improvements and will not increase our 2021 capital budget. 
Texas Delaware and New Mexico are 2 of our highest return assets, and introducing activity in the fourth quarter will place us in a stronger position for 2022. We expect that the market dynamics, which drove Midstream and marketing performance in the third quarter, will continue in the fourth quarter. We have increased forward guidance to reflect improved differentials benefiting the gas marketing business and robust sulfur pricing at Al Hosn. 
We have increased earnings guidance for OxyChem for the third time this year, reflecting year-to-date performance and continued strong product demand. Not only do we expect 2021 to be a record year for OxyChem, we also anticipate the fourth quarter will be even stronger than the record third quarter. 
We believe that the market recognizes and appreciates the value being delivered to shareholders through debt reduction and balance sheet improvement. As we work to repay additional debt, we expect that shareholders will continue to benefit in several key ways. First, we expect that the additional debt reduction will translate into share price appreciation. We acknowledge that healthy commodity prices have played a role in the improvement of Oxy's enterprise value over the last 18 months. Assuming the enterprise value our company remains stable or improves, equity will become a larger portion of enterprise value over time as debt is reduced. 
The interest and financing costs saved on a go-forward basis lowers our cash flow breakeven. We expected a lower cash flow breakeven will result in additional discretionary cash being available to allocate towards our future cash flow priorities, including returning capital to shareholders. As we stated previously, we want to ensure that returning additional capital to shareholders, including any increase in the dividend, is sustainable and ratable throughout the cycle. Reducing the amount of cash committed to interest payments today places us in a stronger position for the sustainable return of capital in the future. 
Finally, lowering fixed costs in the form of interest or interest rate swap payments improves our flexible and optionalities at any point in the commodity cycle. Our balance sheet improvement efforts have placed us with a clear runway for the next few years, and we are taking a thoughtful approach to repaying additional debt in a manner that is opportunistic for Oxy. 
Executing additional tenders or exercising attractive make-whole provisions are just 2 of the solutions we are considering. We may also choose to retire the remaining interest rate swaps, which have an uncollateralized value of approximately $400 million and could be another opportunity to improve cash flow by approximately $45 million per year at the current interest rate curve. As we advance our cash flow priorities, we expect Oxy's financial position to strengthen, aided by our deleveraging efforts and our strong liquidity position. 
As we near the end of 2021, we are preparing for the year ahead with the underlying focus on safe, responsible operations and financial discipline, which we believe will create value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki."

And we're actually filling a gap with what we're doing, as you know, with respect to what others are doing. Every -- there's a lot that really needs to happen in this energy transition for us to be successful to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees. 
So there are some companies in the oil and gas industry that are moving more towards renewables, and that's very much needed. And there's -- there are others that are working very hard to mitigate all of their emissions from current operations. We're working on both of those but not the renewables. 
We're working on reducing our current emissions from ongoing operations but we're also, as you know, taking advantage of the core competence we have with CO2 and the handling of CO2 will enhance oil recovery. So we believe that that's a gap that nobody else is filling. 
And the reason that gap is necessary is for several reasons. First of all, there has to be CO2 removed from the atmosphere. There's nobody in the world that disputes that. So direct air capture is going to be critical for that to happen. So with direct air capture, not only can we remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but also that helps us to develop and produce oil that's either net zero or net negative carbon. So that enables us to provide the hard to decarbonize industry, such as aviation or maritime with fuels that are net zero carbon. 
So there are 2 reasons to build direct air capture, first of all, for the removal from the atmosphere, the provision for providing those net zero carbon fuels. And the things that makes it very versatile is you can build it anywhere. So we think that because of the magnitude of that impact around the world and the need for thousands of these to be built, it provides us the opportunity to be a big part of that and to actually be a leader in developing the technology. So we think we will transition, the transition will take some time. But over the next 10 to 15 years, I think we'll make a lot of progress towards becoming net carbon management company and a go-to company for those that need the CO2 offsets."

I've got a couple of questions, specifically around the return of cash comments. And if you don't -- if you can indulge me for a minute, I'd like to kind of lay out my thinking here. Your share price is lagging pretty badly today despite extraordinary free cash flow yield in our numbers and a clear line of sight to deleveraging. So there's something the market is not acknowledging, obviously. 
And our feedback, I guess, is that you're the only company not giving meaningful cash returns back to investors. So my question is, how do you think about the right level or the appropriate mechanism to return cash when your stock has such a high free cash flow yield. Let's assume that persists. That's my first question. 
And my second question is Pioneer and NOG, one has practically no net debt, the other is targeting no net debt. Where do you think the right level of debt is once you surpass your $25 billion target? Where do you want it to be? So first question, the mechanism for cash returns. Second question, the long-term mid-cycle appropriate level of your balance sheet."

And then beyond that, again, I don't see capital growth until we've gotten to a point where we need to make that happen. 
I think we've talked about it over the last couple of years that we feel like it's very important to keep our breakeven around $40. So as we establish a fixed dividend and move forward, we would grow our cash flow to match the growth in the dividend rate. So that it will happen, and it will happen over time. 
With respect to other considerations for the use of cash, it will really depend on the circumstances that we're in when we actually have reestablished or actually grown the existing fixed dividend that we have."

Our teams have worked hard to try to establish the right kind of contracts and business situations with service providers and material providers to mitigate inflation. We don't think necessarily we would mitigate all of it. We're just not sure right now what inflation will be. But we know that our efficiencies and our established relationships and business situations will help to mitigate some of it. 
We're hoping to continue also to further improve our efficiency so that we can mitigate more than what we would see today. But that's -- there's a lot of work going on around that and especially with respect to how we manage our supply chain and the strength of our position not only in the U.S. but around the world. So we're leveraging that as well. 
With respect to the sustainability capital, I will say that inflation, whatever amount we can't mitigate would be certainly on top of what we have today. And the only thing that I could really point to in terms of what we've said before about this is, in 2022, we won't have as many DUCs to complete as we did in 2021. So there's a difference there. 
We completed about 100 DUCs this year. In addition to that, we're going to have some capital investment that we'll need to make in 2 other areas, both of which we mentioned before. Al Hosn, we'll begin the expansion of that in 2022. So we'll have that cost. We'll also have some incremental cost in the Gulf of Mexico. So it will be higher than the $300 million we had this year because the Gulf is a little bit lumpy in terms of capital investments. So we'll have those things to consider when we are putting together our final plan for 2022."

In fact, the -- for example, the Middle East, that's a -- that area for us is very helpful to continue development there because the contracts provide us some protection in a down market the PSCs do. 
So Oman is important to us from that respect. And we do have a low cost of development there, and we get our cash back fairly quickly. So that's the good part of Oman. It delivers good returns. And Al Hosn is a low decline asset for us. So it plays that role. We want to continue building on our low-decline assets, but that will be -- a lot of the growth for that will be going back to EOR at some point to start building there as we get this anthropogenic CO2. So EOR in the Permian will play a bigger role in the future. But low decline assets are important to us, but the bulk of our dollars beyond sustainability ultimately would go to the Permian."

For example, today, we're not at $25 billion net debt. Now when we get there, we will take a look at all the things that are available to us to do. But starting to grow the dividend we have today is a high priority because of the fact that we did have to reduce it significantly, we want to start restoring it.

So I would say what we see today in the chemical business is still very strong conditions in our vinyl business and steady improvements in the caustic business. And you're correct. Typically, we're normally entering into a seasonally slower period of time. But we're just not seeing that thus far because if you step back and look at the year, the industry, which already was pretty tight on supply to begin the year, lost almost 2 months of production because of the freeze we had in the Gulf states in February and then the impact of Ida that we had in the third quarter. So the combination of those 2 has kept coupled with the demand being as strong as of all our products has kept the supply-demand balance much tighter than anticipated or typically historically at that time of the year. 
Those are the 2 main drivers. On Slide 31 of the deck, we included. Obviously, the main profit drivers for the business and the earnings are going to come from both the PVC business and the caustic soda business. The operating rates year-to-date are over 80% in the PVC business despite the impacts of the 2 storms and the lost months of production. And domestic demand is up over 13% versus this time year-to-date last year. And that's even when we started picking up the demand post COVID last year. 
The other thing I would say is that the construction sector, much like it is with other building products remains very strong with inventory levels still very low. And you can tell that inventories are very tight because exports are really soft still compared to historical levels. And what you have is with exports being down over 1/3 versus prior year, even prior being a COVID year, that's because the discretionary resin is just not available. And so what you only exported PVC resin is really destined for long-term contractual sales from U.S.-based producers that have relationships overseas. And you're not seeing that spot resin flow into the market, which means people are still just trying to get enough resin for the domestic market, which is going to keep prices elevated and margins elevated through that period of time. And so that's kind of atypical for this time of the year, but we do see it continuing through the balance of the year. 
Does it continue all into the winter? Construction necessarily has to slow during the winter, but we don't have a flavor for is how much are people going to want to restock inventories to be ready for what looks like another strong spring construction, which will return pretty early in the year next year. 
On the chlor-alkali side, I'd say chlorine is extremely tight as producers are still trying to seek the highest value for the outlet. This is where OxyChem's vast portfolio of derivatives gives us so much strength versus many others because we're not just making PVC, we're making all 3 parts of the Vinyl's chain. We're also selling into a domestic market that gives us exposure to the polyurethane markets, the TiO2 markets, et cetera, and water -- beyond just water treatment and others that traditionally think of and our own chloromethanes business. 
And so all those we're seeing strong demand and supply/demand balances are very tight. And we will see more than likely in the backside of another difficult operating year in the industry a continued effort to rebuild inventories, not only in supply chain, but there's also -- we're seeing a lot of pent-up demand still coming back as things somewhat return to normal on the backside of the pandemic. Particularly, caustic soda demand globally will continue to improve as manufacturing activity is restored in both South America and Asia and Europe. 
And so what we're seeing on the caustic side is, again, steady improvements where we're not seeing record prices on caustic soda yet like we are on PVC, but some of the prices in Asia have risen to levels that haven't been seen before. And so both businesses are very strong right now. We will see a seasonal slowdown in caustic domestically because you're no longer able to transport caustic up the Mississippi River for the winter, but we don't see it really impacting the industry enough just because inventories are so tight. And so I still think January, February will continue to be slower months for the industry but it's going to be such a narrow period with the tight inventories. We'll probably hit the ground running pretty quick in this spring again."

We'll share more information as we get there about what our next target would be with respect to debt reduction. And then again, it's to start growing our dividend again. 
And the only point at which we would really need to start growing our production would be down the road, where we want to continue growing the dividend. We don't need additional growth from production right now to be able to increase the dividend over the next couple of years because, again, with what we expect the macro to be and the level of increase in our dividend, we believe that we can do that without any production growth over the next at least couple of years.

Everybody, I think, realizes at some point that if we don't achieve our goals through the incentives like 45Q, and there's going to have to be some price mechanism on carbon to make it happen. And so what we're seeing is a lot of corporations are trying to get ahead of that. A lot of corporations are starting to fill. Just see that there's a social license to operate in that -- to have that, there has -- they have to proactively start seeking CO2 credit offsets to become net neutral. United has been one, as you know, that we've announced that wants to do that, and they're proactively committing to dollars to the building of the direct air capture plus, the purchase of the oil that would be the net zero oil. 
Other corporations are calling us. We're getting a lot of incoming interest in the direct air capture because of that. So I do believe that there's going to be sufficient growth and commitment to make what we're doing here in the next -- in the initial phases work. But beyond that, again, what it's going to require is a much more acceleration than that."

Or do you think that this is just business as usual given that you are the operator and that doesn't really change anything. That's the first question. 
On the second question, I think the focus has been everyone knows, nothing new about when you're going to increase your CapEx in the oil and gas sector, and you made it very clear not in any time soon. But how about in the chemical? And in the chemical, you guys have a very unique position. You are not in the typical olefin chain. And that, with the housing sector, has been very strong, and that really has been doing quite well or much better than before. 
So do you have any intention to expand and grow that business? And that may also be good in terms of energy transition. So I want to see that what is your overview in terms of from a growth prospect standpoint for that."

I would just add to that, yes, Paul, that if you look back to the history of projects, whether it was the chlor-alkali plant adjacent to the CO2 plant, or the cracker that we built at Ingleside the venture together or any of the relationships that we have, what we've been able to do is build long-term partnerships with our downstream customers that gives us sort of a pseudo integration into markets. Otherwise, we don't want to build into like CIO2 or polyurethanes or et cetera and partner with the leaders in those industries. 
And so we're always evaluating that. But to Vicki's point, it's going to be something we're going to structure around where we're guaranteed a return on and of the capital necessary to continue to fund the cash from that towards the rest of -- the remainder of the business as a cash flow source. And so I think we're constantly evaluating that. Like anything else, there's probably a dozen projects that end up on the drawing board to get one good one that works out. But you're right that, there's a lot of growth in the chlorovinyl sector as a building product, and the advantage the United States has versus the rest of the world, the feedstocks is pretty significant. So we'll continue to evaluate those. And if something comes together, we'll be happy to share it with the market."
