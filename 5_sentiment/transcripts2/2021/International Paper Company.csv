We will begin our discussion on Slide 3 with full year 2020 results. 
The way International Paper navigated the impacts of the pandemic in 2020 reaffirms my operation and appreciation our employees and their ongoing commitment to take care of each other and to take care of our customers. I'm really proud of the outstanding collaboration across our commercial, supply chain and manufacturing teams to adapt to our customers' rapidly changing needs. 
We ran our manufacturing system well and leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting systems to overcome significant challenges due to the pandemic while managing costs extremely well across our 3 businesses. 
Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2020. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered the company's 11th consecutive year of value-creating returns. Our performance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our employees, our diverse customer base and our world-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. 
Given the significance of economic uncertainty, we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash generation and enhance our financial strength. On capital allocation, we're making choices consistent with our capital allocation framework. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt to further strengthen our balance sheet. We're also seeing significant benefits in our pension plan from the actions that we took to derisk the plan during the past few years, which contributed to a 95% funding level at year in 2020. 
Also in 2020, we returned $800 million to our shareholders, and we continue to invest in our North American and EMEA corrugate packaging business to enhance our capabilities and grow our earnings. We're really excited about the journey to build a better IP. We're building on the strength of our corrugated packaging business and taking meaningful actions to drive sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders. 
In a few minutes, I'll discuss some of the initiatives we have on the way to deliver on our commitment. 
Turning to the full year results on Slide 4. We delivered EBITDA of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Lower year-over-year sales was driven by the decline in Printing Papers demand due to market disruptions from global pandemic. Earnings were impacted by lower demand for paper as well as lower average pricing for the packaging of cellulose fibers. These headwinds bits were fortunately offset by strong volume growth in our packaging business, outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage expense. 
In 2020, we made choices around plant maintenance and other spending priorities to mitigate the impact of market disruptions. Our equity earnings were $77 million, including $48 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was impacted by challenging pulp markets and a noncash foreign exchange loss of $50 million. For the full year, we received $141 million in dividends per mill. Across International Paper, we proactively managed cash levers to deliver another year of outstanding cash generation. 
Moving to Slide 5. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established 3 principles to focus on what we needed to do as a company to remain strongly resilient for all of our stakeholders. First was to keep our employees and contractors safe. Second was to take care of our customers, and third was to maintain the financial strength of the company. And I believe International Paper executed extremely well against that success criteria. We did not experience any material operational disruptions due to COVID-19 while  taking care of our customers. 
It all starts with our employees, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility. Our performance reaffirms my appreciation for our 48,000 employees worldwide. We recognize our teams financially for their capacity, commitment and resilience with a bonus totaling $25 million in the fourth quarter. 
I'm also proud of the work we're doing to support the critical needs in our communities, which included the donation of 2 million corrugated boxes to agencies that have delivered essential food and supplies. We remain absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles, and we'll continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short term and in the long term. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our first quarter outlook. Tim?"
61036,695124073,2191941,"International Paper Company, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6, which is our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Our 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with COVID-19.",2298,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6, which is our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. Our 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with COVID-19. 
Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a significant headwind mostly due to the full year impact of 2019 index movements in our North American packaging business as well as lower average pricing in Cellulose Fibers and the Printing Papers business. Volume was a drag on earnings due to the unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers. The impact was partly offset by strong volume in our packaging business, driven by higher demand across most consumer segments. 
We managed operations and cost well in a challenging environment with no material operational disruptions due to COVID-19. Our teams performed at a high level under reconfigured work systems to protect our employees and contractors. We did experience higher operating and distribution costs in the latter part of the year as we flexed our system to meet very strong packaging demand. 
Input costs were favorable for the full year driven by lower wood, energy cost and distribution costs, partly offset by higher recovered fiber costs. I would also note that cost for wood, recovered fiber, energy and distribution increased in the fourth quarter. 
Corporate items were favorable, driven by outstanding cost management and lower interest expense based on significant debt reduction. On the full year 2020, our operational tax rate was 25% and compared to 26% in 2019. And equity earnings decreased due to lower earnings, which includes $0.13 of unfavorable FX impact. 
Turning now to Slide 7, which shows our fourth quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.75 per share, which includes a $0.05 impact related to the employee recognition bonus that Mark discussed earlier. Sales improved sequentially and came in better than our expectations, driven by strong demand in our North American packaging business. 
EBITDA decreased due to the higher operating and input cost. As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow, which we'll continue to apply in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by about $600 million, bringing our full year 2020 debt reduction to $1.7 billion. 
Turning to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 8. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.75. Looking at the bridge, lower price/mix was driven by prior period price flowthrough in packaging and cellulose fibers. Volume was favorable, driven mostly by strong demand in corrugated packaging in North America and EMEA as well as higher seasonal demand for papers in Brazil and Russia. 
Operations and costs were a significant headwind in the quarter. We experienced some reliability issues on our North American containerboard system, most of which are behind us now. We also experienced higher marginal operating and distribution costs to meet very strong packaging demand. We had a $20 million asset write-off in cellulose fibers in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, our sequential earnings were impacted by the non-repeat of $30 million of favorable items in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to note that the employee recognition bonus is reflected in operations involved, which was allocated to each business. 
Input costs were unfavorable due to higher wood and recovered fiber, higher seasonal energy costs and higher distribution costs. We're experiencing significant rail truck and ocean transportation and congestion. And we expect recovered fiber and distribution costs to trend higher as we enter 2021. 
Higher corporate expenses reflects the effective tax rate of 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to 19% in the third quarter, which included a favorable adjustment after finalizing our 2019 tax returns. 
Equity earnings includes a noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.05 in the fourth quarter [indiscernible] as compared to a $0.14 loss in the third quarter. 
Let me turn to the segments now, and I'll start with industrial Packaging on Slide 9. Volume improved sequentially across all regions, with strong demand in North America outpacing the impact of the 3 last shipping days in the fourth quarter. We're seeing broad-based demand strength across all of our channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. Just about every consumer segment accelerated in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to see strong double-digit growth in e-commerce, and we believe the vast majority of e-commerce adoption is permanent. We're also seeing strong demand for consumer and durable goods, especially for building materials. Foodservice categories continue to lag, and the pace of recovery will depend on the restaurant and travel industry recovery. Export containerboard demand is also robust. We have strong backlogs as we have prioritized containerboard shipments to our integrated system here in North America to meet our customers' demands. 
Operations and costs were a significant headwind due to several factors. We experienced some isolated reliability issues late in the quarter, most of which are now behind us. We also faced higher costs in our mill and box system to meet the strong demand, including the impact of less optimal containerboard sourcing to our box plants. We also experienced higher supply chain costs and overtime, with just about every box plant running on weekends. And lastly, recall that ops and costs includes the employee bonus we discussed earlier, which for packaging, represents about $15 million. 
Maintenance and outage costs improved sequentially as planned. Input costs increased driven by higher recovered fiber, seasonal energy and distribution costs. Cost pressure for recovered fiber and distribution continued as we enter the first quarter, which reflects the broad strength in [indiscernible]. 
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. Price and mix was unfavorable on the contract flowthrough of lower third quarter list price. Volume was stable. Demand for fluff pulp improved late in the fourth quarter, following the expected destocking. Operations and costs were impacted by a $20 million write-off of capital and engineering costs, following a review of the capital investment needs for the business. Maintenance outage costs increased and input costs were essentially flat. 
Taking a closer look at flu pulp demand. As I mentioned, demand improved throughout the fourth quarter. Demand continued to improve as we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs for fluff pulp. In addition, port congestion is stretching supply chains due to the high levels of imports in the U.S. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 11. The business delivered earnings of $80 million in the fourth quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our North American, Brazilian and Russian regions delivered returns above the cost of capital. We continue to leverage our strong brands, our world-class customer service and our low-cost system to maximize performance as we navigate a challenging demand environment. 
Looking at the fourth quarter performance across the segment. Price and mix was stable. Volume improved sequentially across all regions with stronger seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia. We're seeing a gradual recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return to office and return to school activity. 
Operations and cost includes higher seasonal energy consumption and the non-repeat of favorable items in the third quarter of about $10 million. Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by nearly 100,000 tons sequentially. Maintenance outages increased as expected, and input costs increased primarily due to higher transportation and seasonal energy costs. 
Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12. The joint venture delivered $53 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 30% on improved commercial performance. Volume improved 16% year-over-year on strong softwood pulp exports. Price and mix was also favorable with price realization for softwood accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter equity earnings included a foreign exchange gain on U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's after tax portion was $22 million or $0.05 per share. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $519 million, which represents a 26% margin. Full year 2020 equity earnings were $48 million, which includes a $50 million foreign exchange loss on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Although 2020 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance and low-cost system make it a powerful cash generator. We expect to receive about $100 million in dividends from Ilim in 2021. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Mark said in his opening remarks, we generated outstanding free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility and some of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation. Given the significant economic uncertainty, we chose to pull some of those cash levers to reinforce the company's financial strength. 
We executed well on the things that impacted cash. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked in 2020 and the choices that we made around our plant maintenance and other spending priorities. In the fourth quarter, we also benefited from a tax refund claim, which contributed $115 million to free cash flow. Our early actions and strong execution across the company enabled us to deliver another year of outstanding free cash flow generation. 
Turning to Slide 14. I wanted to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2020 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper as we move forward. 
We will maintain a strong balance sheet, and we're committed to our current investment grade rating with a targeted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8x on a Moody's basis. We're very pleased with the progress we made on the balance sheet, debt and pension in 2020. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt and our pension gap improved by $500 million. 
Our pension plan is sufficiently funded. We closed 2020 with a healthy 95% funding level, and we feel really good about the actions we have taken over the past few years to derisk the plan.  We closed 2020 at 2.9x leverage in a much better place, and we're committed to getting to our target range. 
Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2020, we returned $800 million to shareowners. Over the past 5 years, we've returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases or just over 50% of our free cash flow. 
We remain committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend of a target range of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. And we will continue evaluating our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that share repurchase opportunities are weighed against other capital allocation options, always with a commitment to maximize value creation. 
Investment excellence is essential growing earnings and cash. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around $800 million. We will continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pull back as circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build out capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth. 
We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging business in North America and Europe. 
Continuing on Slide 14. I want to provide an update on the 2006 timber monetization installment notes. After careful consideration, we've decided not to extend the notes. When these notes mature in August of 2021, we expect to receive $630 million in cash, which represents our equity. We expect to pay about $75 million in taxes upon maturity of the timber notes. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 15 and our first quarter outlook. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong as we enter the first quarter. Demand for fluff pulp accelerated in the fourth quarter, and that momentum continues in the first quarter. 
In Printing Papers, we're seeing a modest recovery in demand, but challenges will likely persist until we see a broad-based return to offices and schools. 
Taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $65 million on the realization of our November 2020 price increase. Volume is expected to be flat sequentially with strong box demand offset by 1 less shipping day in the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35 million. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $87 million and costs are expected to increase by $30 million, mostly due to higher recovered fiber and distribution cost. 
In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $15 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and input costs are expected to improve by $35 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $6 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million, mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. 
Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $15 million on lower seasonal demand in Latin America and Russia. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $2 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million, again, mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. 
And under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. Coming back to plant maintenance expense, for the full year 2021, we plan $155 million of higher expenses. This increase includes deferrals we chose to make in our packaging mill system to meet strong customer demand as well as the impact of higher coal maintenance outages across of the system. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

Coming on to Slide 16 now. As we shared with you in December, we are taking meaningful actions to build a better IP and accelerate profitable growth with a focus on corrugated packaging. We're committed to deliver $350 million to $400 mill",740,"Thank you, Tim. Coming on to Slide 16 now. As we shared with you in December, we are taking meaningful actions to build a better IP and accelerate profitable growth with a focus on corrugated packaging. We're committed to deliver $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings by the end of 2023. 
As part of our commitment, we will deliver $50 million to $100 million of incremental annual earnings growth in our businesses through commercial execution and investment excellence. We'll also deliver $300 million of structural cost reduction.
We have initiatives underway in 3 areas. First, we will streamline and simplify our organization to support a packaging focused company with a more focused geographic footprint. 
Second, we will redesign processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing. 
And third, we are identifying opportunities to better optimize our fleet of assets to make the right products on the right assets to further improve our cost position and to be more efficient with our capital. 
As we move forward, we will be sharing with you the multiple streams of earnings initiatives we have underway and when you should expect to see them enhance our earnings. Today, let me describe one of the key enablers to delivering on our process and asset optimization cost savings. And as you noticed on the slide, that area accounts for about 70% our structural cost reduction target. 
We will use new approaches that leverage technology and data analytics in our businesses. We established a dedicated team that's been working closely with external partners and our businesses over the past year to identify, develop and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities, which are now moving to scaled implementation. 
Turning to Slide 17. You can see a few areas where we're using data to provide greater visibility and actionable insights. These tools enable new approaches to optimize our value chain, from our mills to our box plants, and ultimately, to our customers. We expect these initiatives to deliver between $150 million and $200 million in annual earnings improvement. We are making excellent progress scaling up several of these initiatives and expect to realize about half of these benefits in 2022. 
Let me give you a few examples of what this looks like. We would use real-time data to optimize production scheduling across our box plants in North America. Although many of the benefits result in lower costs across our system, we'll also gain low-cost incremental capacity in our box system to pursue profitable growth with very little incremental capital.  We're also using third-party logistics technology to optimize transportation planning and reduce distribution costs in our box plants. 
In our mills, we'll use continuous online monitoring and data analytics to improve fiber, chemical and energy consumption. In addition, online equipment monitoring will also enable us to predict potential equipment failures, improve reliability and reduce our overall maintenance costs. 
And in sourcing, we have greater visibility and more effective tools across a broader set of our procurement activities. We'll use internal and external data to develop a more targeted catalog of sourcing options to drive savings in operating and repair materials. Working with our external partners, our team is moving quickly to scale these opportunities and integrate them into our business processes. The team is also working closely with our businesses to identify more opportunities. 
Let me close on Slide 18. Our 2020 performance adds to my confidence in the path we're charting to build a better IP. We're motivated by the opportunities we have to accelerate value creation for our shareholders. Now I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic, and there's still significant uncertainty. International Paper's strengthened resilience endures. We're proud of the essential nature of our products that we make. Our employees have demonstrated a commitment to take care of each other and our customers. And that commitment continues.  Our customers can count on International Paper to be there for them and deliver superior solutions. And our communities can count us to be responsible partners to improve the lives of the people who depend on us. 
We have an exciting and ambitious agenda. We will continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company in the short-term and in the long-term for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, we are ready to take your questions."

On the input side, of course, we track those quarter-by-quarter, and it's really driven on what's happening in the market. So in the moment, given transportation, we see that as a bit of a headwind given the economic activity that we're experiencing across the country. Spot rates on truck are elevated, as I mentioned in the speaker notes, congestion across most of the transportation mode. So we'll have to see how it plays out. 
And some of it is driven marginally by just the incremental demand growth that we're seeing in a moment and sourcing transportation to make sure we get it to customers on time. So yes, it's a bit of a headwind."

But with the offset that we mentioned earlier, we are trying to be more efficient on capital.

And the company would be better off and the cash generation profile will be better off. 
So we're constantly looking at that.

The commercial strategy that we deployed and people in the pulp market deployed was that pulp for a long time was an extra product on top of a broad pulp offering. It's now becoming a real market on its own and probably warrants a different commercial approach. And that's always difficult once you started one way to change it. 
But that is definitely our objective, to change the way we value the product and to make sure we understand that we're getting appropriate value for what product and service we provide. It will take some time. But I think the balance side is not improving it, is that the investment in making sure that product is available long term will be less attractive. And I think most markets, products are really valuable and the technical specifications are really important, and it seems that they are, usually can correct over time. But it's not easy, and you make a good point."

So for instance, if you think about the supply chain, from fiber to the mills, containerboard to box plants and then to customers and thinking about how we manage board combinations across our system based on availability and where to arbitrage transportation for fiber cost is an opportunity that we think we can really exploit. 
And so the tools are giving us a way to compare options that are just, quite frankly, too complicated do in the moment by hand. And we're building technology tools that will help us do that and make better trade-off decisions."

We will begin our discussion on Slide 3 with full year 2020 results. 
The way International Paper navigated the impacts of the pandemic in 2020 reaffirms my admiration and appreciation for our employees and their ongoing commitment to take care of each other and to take care of our customers. I'm really proud of the outstanding collaboration across our commercial, supply chain and manufacturing teams to adapt to our customers' rapidly changing needs. We ran our manufacturing system well and leveraged the flexibility of our mill and converting systems to overcome significant challenges due to the pandemic while managing costs extremely well across our 3 businesses. 
Looking at our performance, International Paper delivered solid earnings and outstanding free cash flow in 2020. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered the company's 11th consecutive year of value-creating returns. Our performance demonstrates the strength and resilience of our employees, our diverse customer base and our world-class manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. 
Given the significant of economic uncertainty, we took prudent and early actions to reinforce cash generation and enhance our financial strength. On capital allocation, we're making choices consistent with our capital allocation framework. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt to further strengthen our balance sheet. We're also seeing significant benefits in our pension plan from the actions that we took to derisk the plan during the past few years, which contributed to a 95% funding level at year-end 2020. Also in 2020, we returned $800 million to our shareholders, and we continued to invest in our North American and EMEA corrugated packaging business to enhance our capabilities and grow our earnings. 
We're really excited about the path we're charting to build a better IP. We're building on the strength of our corrugated packaging business and taking meaningful actions to drive sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders. In a few minutes, I'll discuss some of the initiatives we have underway to deliver on our commitment. 
Turning to the full year results on Slide 4. We delivered EBITDA of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Lower year-over-year sales was driven by the decline in Printing Papers demand due to market disruptions from global pandemic. Earnings were impacted by lower demand for paper as well as lower average pricing for the packaging of cellulose fibers. These headwinds were partially offset by strong volume growth in our packaging business, outstanding cost management and lower maintenance outage expense. In 2020, we made choices around plant maintenance and other spending priorities to mitigate the impact of market disruptions. 
Our equity earnings were $77 million, including $48 million from our Ilim joint venture, which was impacted by challenging pulp markets and a noncash foreign exchange loss of $50 million. For the full year, we received $141 million in dividends from Ilim. Across International Paper, we proactively managed cash levers to deliver another year of outstanding cash generation. 
Moving to Slide 5. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established 3 principles to focus on what we needed to do as a company to remain strongly resilient for all of our stakeholders. First was to keep our employees and contractors safe, second was to take care of our customers and third was to maintain the financial strength of the company. I believe International Paper executed extremely well against that success criteria. We did not experience any material operational disruptions due to COVID-19 while taking care of our customers. 
It all starts with our employees, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility. Our performance reaffirms my appreciation for our 48,000 employees worldwide. We recognized our teams financially for their tenacity, commitment and resilience with a bonus totaling $25 million in the fourth quarter. 
I'm also proud of the work we're doing to support the critical needs in our communities, which included the donation of 2 million corrugated boxes to agencies that have delivered essential food and supplies. We remain absolutely committed to our COVID-19 principles, and we'll continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company for all of our stakeholders in the short term and in the long term. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our first quarter outlook. Tim?"
61036,695124073,2192262,"International Paper Company, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","International Paper Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark.

I'm on Slide 6, which shows our year-over-year operating earnings bridge. 
Our 2020 results reflect strong execution and effective cost management to mitigate the impact of market disruptions associated with COVID-19. 
Looking at the bridge, price and mix were a significant headwind mostly due to the full year impact of 2019 index movements in our North American packaging business as well as lower average pricing in cellulose fibers and the Printing Papers business. Volume was a drag on earnings due to the unprecedented decline in demand for printing papers. The impact was partly offset by strong volume in our packaging business driven by higher demand across most consumer segments. 
We managed operations and costs well in a challenging environment with no material operational disruptions due to COVID-19. Our teams performed at a high level under reconfigured work systems to protect our employees and contractors. We did experience higher operating and distribution costs in the latter part of the year as we flexed our system to meet very strong packaging demand. 
Input costs were favorable for the full year driven by lower wood, energy cost and distribution costs, partly offset by higher recovered fiber costs. I would also note that costs for wood, recovered fiber, energy and distribution increased in the fourth quarter. 
Corporate items were favorable driven by outstanding cost management and lower interest expense based on significant debt reduction. 
For the full year 2020, our operational tax rate was 25% compared to 26% in 2019. 
And equity earnings decreased due to the lower Ilim earnings, which includes $0.13 of unfavorable FX impact. 
Turning now to Slide 7, which shows our fourth quarter results. Operating earnings were $0.75 per share, which includes a $0.05 impact related to the employee recognition bonus that Mark discussed earlier. 
Sales improved sequentially and came in better than our expectations driven by strong demand in our North American packaging business. 
EBITDA decreased due to the higher operating and input cost. 
As already mentioned, we generated robust free cash flow, which we'll continue to apply in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework. 
In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by about $600 million, bringing our full year 2020 debt reduction to $1.7 billion. 
Turning to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 8. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.75. Looking at the bridge, lower price/mix was driven by prior period price flow-through in packaging and cellulose fibers. 
Volume was favorable driven mostly by strong demand in corrugated packaging in North America and EMEA as well as higher seasonal demand for papers in Brazil and Russia. 
Operations and costs were a significant headwind in the quarter. We experienced some reliability issues in our North American containerboard system, most of which are behind us now. We also experienced higher marginal operating and distribution costs to meet very strong packaging demand. 
We had a $20 million asset write-off in cellulose fibers in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, our sequential earnings were impacted by the non-repeat of $30 million of favorable items in the third quarter. 
I'd also like to note that the employee recognition bonus is reflected in operations and costs, which was allocated to each business. 
Input costs were unfavorable due to higher wood and recovered fiber, higher seasonal energy costs and higher distribution costs. We're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion. And we expect recovered fiber and distribution costs to trend higher as we enter 2021. 
Higher corporate expenses reflects the effective tax rate of 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to 19% in the third quarter, which included a favorable adjustment after finalizing our 2019 tax returns. 
Equity earnings includes a noncash foreign exchange gain of $0.05 in the fourth quarter for Ilim as compared to a $0.14 loss in the third quarter. 
Let me turn to the segments now, and I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 9. Volume improved sequentially across all regions, with strong demand in North America outpacing the impact of the 3 less shipping days in the fourth quarter. We're seeing broad-based demand strength across all of our channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. 
Just about every consumer segment accelerated in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to see strong, double-digit growth in e-commerce, and we believe the vast majority of e-commerce adoption is permanent. We're also seeing strong demand for consumer and durable goods, especially for building materials. Foodservice categories continued to lag, and the pace of recovery will depend on the restaurant and travel industry recovery. Export containerboard demand is also robust. We have strong backlogs as we have prioritized containerboard shipments to our integrated system here in North America to meet our customers' demands. 
Operations and costs were a significant headwind due to several factors. We experienced some isolated reliability issues late in the quarter, most of which are now behind us. We also faced higher costs in our mill and box system to meet the strong demand, including the impact of less optimal containerboard sourcing to our box plants. We also experienced higher supply chain costs and overtime with just about every box plant running on weekends. And lastly, recall that ops and costs includes the employee bonus we discussed earlier, which for packaging represents about $15 million. 
Maintenance and outage costs improved sequentially as planned. Input costs increased driven by higher recovered fiber, seasonal energy and distribution costs. Cost pressure for recovered fiber and distribution continued as we entered the first quarter, which reflects the broad strength in demand that we're seeing. 
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 10. Price and mix was unfavorable on the contract flow-through of lower third quarter list price. Volume was stable. Demand for fluff pulp improved late in the fourth quarter following the expected destocking. Operations and costs were impacted by a $20 million write-off of capital and engineering costs following a review of the capital investment needs for the business. Maintenance outage costs increased and input costs were essentially flat. 
Taking a closer look at fluff pulp demand. As I mentioned, demand improved throughout the fourth quarter. Demand continued to improve as we entered 2021 with healthy backlogs for fluff pulp. In addition, port congestion is stretching supply chains due to the high levels of imports in the U.S. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 11. The business delivered earnings of $80 million in the fourth quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our North American, Brazilian and Russian regions delivered returns above the cost of capital. We continue to leverage our strong brands, our world-class customer service and our low-cost system to maximize performance as we navigate a challenging demand environment. 
Looking at the fourth quarter performance across the segment, price and mix was stable. Volume improved sequentially across all regions with stronger seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia. We're seeing a gradual recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return-to-office and return-to-school activity. 
Operations and costs includes higher seasonal energy consumption and the non-repeat of favorable items in the third quarter of about $10 million. Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by nearly 100,000 tons sequentially. Maintenance outages increased, as expected, and input costs increased primarily due to higher transportation and seasonal energy costs. 
Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 12. The joint venture delivered $53 million in equity earnings in the fourth quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 30% on improved commercial performance. Volume improved 16% year-over-year on strong softwood pulp exports. Price and mix was also favorable with price realization for softwood accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
Fourth quarter equity earnings include a foreign exchange gain on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt, of which IP's aftertax portion was $22 million or $0.05 per share. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $519 million, which represents a 26% margin. Full year 2020 equity earnings were $48 million, which includes a $50 million foreign exchange loss on Ilim's U.S. dollar-denominated net debt. 
Although 2020 was a challenging year across global pulp markets, Ilim's strong operational performance and low-cost system make it a powerful cash generator. We expect to receive about $100 million in dividends from Ilim in 2021. 
Moving to Slide 13. As Mark said in his opening remarks, we generated outstanding free cash flow of $2.3 billion in 2020. In our first quarter earnings call last year, we highlighted the company's financial flexibility and some of the cash levers we had available to enhance our cash generation. Given the significant economic uncertainty, we chose to pull some of those cash levers to reinforce the company's financial strength. 
We executed well on the things that impacted cash. In addition, COVID-19 changed the way we worked in 2020 and the choices that we made around our plant maintenance and other spending priorities. In the fourth quarter, we also benefited from a tax refund claim, which contributed $115 million to free cash flow. Our early actions and strong execution across the company enabled us to deliver another year of outstanding free cash flow generation. 
Turning to Slide 14. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in 2020 and provide clarity on what you can expect from International Paper as we move forward. 
We will maintain a strong balance sheet, and we're committed to our current investment-grade rating with a targeted debt-to-EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.8x on a Moody's basis. 
We're very pleased with the progress we made on the balance sheet, debt and pension in 2020. We repaid $1.7 billion of debt, and our pension gap improved by $500 million. 
Our pension plan is sufficiently funded. We closed 2020 with a healthy 95% funding level, and we feel really good about the actions we have taken over the past few years to derisk the plan.  
We closed 2020 at 2.9x leverage. We're in a much better place, and we're committed to getting to our target range. 
Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In 2020, we returned $800 million to shareowners. Over the past 5 years, we've returned nearly $5.2 billion to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases or just over 50% of our free cash flow. 
We remain committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend with a target range of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. And we will continue evaluating our free cash flow and intrinsic value to ensure that share repurchase opportunities are weighed against other capital allocation options, always with a commitment to maximize value creation. 
Investment excellence is essential, growing earnings and cash. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around $800 million. We will continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pull back as circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build out capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth. 
We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging business in North America and Europe. 
Continuing on Slide 14, I want to provide an update on the 2006 timber monetization installment notes. After careful consideration, we've decided not to extend the notes. When these notes mature in August of 2021, we expect to receive $630 million in cash, which represents our equity. We expect to pay about $75 million in taxes upon maturity of the timber notes. 
Now I'll turn to Slide 15 and our first quarter outlook. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong as we entered the first quarter. Demand for fluff pulp accelerated in the fourth quarter, and that momentum continues in the first quarter. 
In Printing Papers, we're seeing a modest recovery in demand, but challenges will likely persist until we see a broad-based return to offices and schools. 
Taking a closer look at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $65 million on the realization of our November 2020 price increase. Volume is expected to be flat sequentially with strong box demand offset by 1 less shipping day in the first quarter. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35 million. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $87 million, and then the costs are expected to increase by $30 million mostly due to higher recovered fiber and distribution cost. 
In Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $15 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to be stable. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $35 million, maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $6 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. 
Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $15 million on lower seasonal demand in Latin America and Russia. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $2 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million, again mostly due to higher seasonal wood and energy costs. 
And under equity earnings, you will see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. 
Coming back to plant maintenance outage expense, for the full year 2021, we plan $155 million of higher expenses. This increase includes deferrals we chose to make in our packaging mill system to meet strong customer demand as well as the impact of higher coal maintenance outages across the system. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

As we shared with you in December, we are taking meaningful actions to build a better IP and accelerate profitable growth with a focus on corrugated packaging. We're committed to deliver $350 million to $400 million",740,"Thank you, Tim. I'm on Slide 16 now. 
As we shared with you in December, we are taking meaningful actions to build a better IP and accelerate profitable growth with a focus on corrugated packaging. We're committed to deliver $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings by the end of 2023. 
As part of our commitment, we will deliver $50 million to $100 million of incremental annual earnings growth in our businesses through commercial execution and investment excellence. We'll also deliver $300 million of structural cost reduction.
We have initiatives underway in 3 areas. First, we will streamline and simplify our organization to support a packaging-focused company with a more focused geographic footprint. 
Second, we will redesign processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs in areas such as maintenance and reliability, distribution and logistics and sourcing. 
And third, we are identifying opportunities to better optimize our fleet of assets to make the right products on the right assets to further improve our cost position and to be more efficient with our capital. 
As we move forward, we will be sharing with you the multiple streams of earnings initiatives we have underway and when you should expect to see them enhance our earnings. Today, let me describe one of the key enablers to delivering on our process and asset optimization cost savings. And as you noticed on the slide, that area accounts for about 70% our structural cost reduction target. 
We will use new approaches that leverage technology and data analytics in our businesses. We established a dedicated team that's been working closely with external partners and our businesses over the past year to identify, develop and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities, which are now moving to scaled implementation. 
Turning to Slide 17. You can see a few areas where we're using data to provide greater visibility and actionable insights. These tools enable new approaches to optimize our value chain, from our mills to our box plants and ultimately to our customers. We expect these initiatives to deliver between $150 million and $200 million in annual earnings improvement. We are making excellent progress scaling up several of these initiatives and expect to realize about half of these benefits in 2022. 
Let me give you a few examples of what this looks like. We will use real-time data to optimize production scheduling across our box plants in North America. Although many of the benefits result in lower costs across our system, we'll also gain low-cost incremental capacity in our box system to pursue profitable growth with very little incremental capital. We're also using third-party logistics technology to optimize transportation planning and reduce distribution costs in our box plants. 
In our mills, we'll use continuous online monitoring and data analytics to improve fiber, chemical and energy consumption. In addition, online equipment monitoring will also enable us to predict potential equipment failures, improve reliability and reduce our overall maintenance costs. 
And in sourcing, we have greater visibility and more effective tools across a broader set of our procurement activities. We'll use internal and external data to develop a more targeted catalog of sourcing options to drive savings in operating and repair materials. 
Working with our external partners, our team is moving quickly to scale these opportunities and integrate them into our business processes. The team is also working closely with our businesses to identify more opportunities. 
Let me close on Slide 18. Our 2020 performance adds to my confidence in the path we're charting to build a better IP. We're motivated by the opportunities we have to accelerate value creation for our shareowners. 
Now I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic and there's still significant uncertainty. International Paper's strengthened resilience endures. We're proud of the essential nature of our products that we make. Our employees have demonstrated a commitment to take care of each other and our customers, and that commitment continues. 
Our customers can count on International Paper to be there for them and deliver superior solutions. And our communities can count us to be responsible partners to improve the lives of the people who depend on us. 
We have an exciting and ambitious agenda. We will continue to focus on what we need to do to further strengthen the company in the short term and in the long term for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, we are ready to take your questions."

On the input side, of course, we track those quarter-by-quarter, and it's really driven by what's happening in the market. So in the moment, given transportation, we see that as a bit of a headwind just given the economic activity that we're experiencing across the country. Spot rates on truck are elevated. As I mentioned in the speaker notes, congestion across most of the transportation modes. So we'll have to see how it plays out. 
And some of it is driven marginally by just the incremental demand growth that we're seeing in the moment and sourcing transportation to make sure we get it to customers on time. So yes, it's a bit of a headwind."

Paper and board production is increasing, and that's increasing their need for softwood pulp, which improves the entire market supply/demand dynamics, and that flows to fluff pulp. So we think it's, the broader Chinese economy, improving. It looks to be sustainable as China seems to be first in really recovering from the economic impacts of the pandemic. 
Most of Ilim's -- so I think your second part of your question was the -- regarding softwood that Ilim makes. Almost all of what Ilim makes goes to China, if not all of it. There could be a couple of other markets that are not technically China. But it's all China and the greater Asian market in that area because remember, Anthony, 2 pulp mills are in Siberia. So we ship directly that way and virtually nothing goes anywhere else."

I would characterize our price realization on the containerboard and box price increase that was announced in November as following a typical pattern.

We also took it as an opportunity, given the unusual nature of last year, as we referenced, to think a little bit differently about to what extent and how we would deploy our maintenance outages across the fleet. So the trend would -- or the normalized, if you will, would be higher than last year. 
But with the offsets that we mentioned earlier, we are trying to become more efficient on capital, and some of these predictive reliability capabilities are giving us an opportunity over time, we think, to anticipate a problem before it actually happens, which should yield a lower cost, whether it's capital or expense, in our facilities."

We really look at maintenance in totality, so there's a capital expenditure component. But there's an expense component that oftentimes is 2x the capital component. 
So when we look at lowering the cash needed to run in place, as you say, to maintain today's earnings and cash flow, we look at the total number. And sometimes well-placed capital expenditures can significantly and dramatically lower your ongoing expenses, and the company would be better off and the cash generation profile will be better off. So we're constantly looking at that. 
What's exciting about some of these new technological approaches is we can probably, if we're successful, save not only on CapEx so it's mostly condition based, not time or inspection based, but also on the expense side. So there's a huge multiplier if we get it right."

International Paper delivered solid earnings and strong cash generation in the first quarter. Our mill and converting system performed well to mitigate the significant impact of the winter storm and support a strong customer demand across all of our packaging channels. Input costs and transportation were a headwind in the first quarter, especially for energy, which was impacted by the duration of the severe cold temperatures in the Southern U.S. 
We see momentum building, continuing to build across our 3 businesses with very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for absorbent pulp. And in papers, we're seeing an improved supply-demand backdrop in all of our key geographies. 
Our capital allocation in the first quarter, we repaid $108 million of debt and we returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases. 
Our performance again demonstrates the agility and resilience of International Paper to perform well across many different circumstances. We're passing the 1-year mark of the global pandemic, and I could not be any prouder of the commitment of our employees to take care of each other and take care of our customers. The vast majority of our 48,000 team members work in our mills and conversion plants each and every day, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility. 
We also made solid progress on the spin-off of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete late in the third quarter this year. Our team is also making strong progress to develop and deliver multiple streams of earnings initiatives to achieve the $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings and accelerated growth by the end of 2023. 
As we work to build a better IP, we remain laser-focused on delivering superior solutions to our customers, executing well and meeting our commitments to our shareowners and our other stakeholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4, which shows our first quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $730 million and free cash flow of $423 million despite the $80 million pretax earnings impact from the winter storm in the Southern U.S. Revenue increased by more than $100 million sequentially, primarily driven by price realization in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. And again, free cash flow is strong with a continued focus on running our businesses well, controlling our cost and actively managing our working capital. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our second quarter outlook.

I'll start with the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. First quarter operating earnings were $0.76. The winter storm impacted pretax earnings by $80 million or a $0.15 impact to operating EPS. We're still",1864,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning. I'll start with the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. 
First quarter operating earnings were $0.76. The winter storm impacted pretax earnings by $80 million or a $0.15 impact to operating EPS. We're still in the very early stages of the insurance process and do not have a recovery estimate at this time. 
Looking at the bridge, price/mix was strong driven by prior period price flow-through and packaging and cellulose fibers. Volume was essentially flat with continued strong demand for corrugated packaging and absorbent pulp. Overall papers volume continues to recover even though we saw the expected seasonal decline for papers in Brazil in the first quarter. 
Operations and costs were favorable. Mill and box system performance was solid and helped mitigate the impact of the winter storm, which was a cost headwind of $55 million to operations. Maintenance costs increased sequentially, and we expect to complete about 65% of our maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Input costs were unfavorable, which included a $20 million cost impact from the storm, mostly for energy and raw materials such as starch and adhesives. Overall, we're seeing higher costs for recovered fiber, energy, chemicals and distribution, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. 
Transportation conditions are challenging, and we're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion. Higher corporate expenses were driven by a noncash foreign exchange loss on intercompany loans, and lower equity earnings are partly attributed to the reduced ownership position in GPK.
Turning to the segments, and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong demand across all of our channels, including box, sheets and containerboard. For the quarter, volume was essentially flat. We lost 145,000 tons of containerboard production due to the winter storm. Although our mills and box plants in the region recovered quickly, the storm did impact sales in the quarter. We had nearly 30 box plants in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi affected by the storm, which impacted our box shipments in the quarter. 
Price and mix was strong. Our November increase is essentially implemented fully with the $131 million first quarter realization. And I would add, this is one of the fastest implementations that we've seen. 
Operations and cost includes about $55 million impact from the winter storm, about half of which is due to unabsorbed fixed costs and the balance is related to repairs and higher distribution costs. Overall, mill and box plant performance was solid, and we leveraged our system to support strong customer demand across all of our channels. 
Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially. We did defer about $30 million of maintenance outages from the first to the second quarter due to the significant production loss resulting from the winter storm. We expect to complete about 75% of our planned maintenance outages for packaging in the first half of the year. 
Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, including about $20 million related to the winter storm due to higher energy, distribution and raw materials and our mill system and box plants. Higher recovered fiber costs were another significant headwind in the quarter. We expect continued cost pressure for recovered for energy distribution in the second quarter, and we're still seeing the lingering effects and certain chemicals produced in Texas and Louisiana as suppliers recover from the winter storm. 
Turning to Slide 7. As we enter the second quarter, we're seeing continued strong demand across all of our channels. U.S. and export containerboard demand is strong with low inventories in all regions. Our first quarter shipments were impacted by the significant production loss resulting from the storm. We're working with our customers to recover from extensive backlogs. 
In our U.S. box system demand remains robust as more states start lifting restrictions. E-commerce, again grew at a strong double-digit pace in the first quarter, and we believe the majority of the accelerated consumer adoption in this channel is permanent. 
With states starting to reopen, we're also seeing improved demand in segments with greater exposure to restaurant and foodservice channels, such as produce and protein, although we're still not back to pre-COVID levels. 
Nondurables, excluding food and beverage, represents about 30% of U.S. box demand across a wide range of consumer and industrial products. This segment is benefiting from strong consumer demand in the broad manufacturing sector recovery. And lastly, demand for durable goods, which had the immediate pullback due to COVID is benefiting from a healthy housing market. 
We're well positioned and have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a meaningful way, and our packaging team continues to focus on delivering superior packaging solutions to help our customers succeed. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'll provide an update on the progress we're making in our EMEA packaging business. Our objective is to bring this business back to sustainable mid-teen margins and generate returns above our cost of capital. We're well on our way to achieving our goal. 
In the first quarter, we improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $20 million compared with last year. The Madrid mill is fully ramped, and we have more integration and cost opportunities available. We're integrating our world-class lightweight recycled containerboard with our box network in Southern Europe to provide customers with a broader array of packaging solutions. 
We've improved our footprint in the Iberian Peninsula through selective acquisitions, including 2 box plants in Spain acquired at the end of the first quarter. These acquisitions provide additional integration opportunities with the Madrid mill. And more importantly, they enhance our commercial capabilities in the region. 
We continue to make progress with our box system performance and have more opportunity ahead. All our plants have clear commercial and operational plans, and we're leveraging the skills and resources from across the company to deliver on our commitments. 
The map on the slide shows our packaging footprint in Europe after the sale of our Turkey packaging business, which we expect to close in the second quarter. After the sale, the EMEA packaging business will have 2 recycled containerboard mills, 21 box plants and 2 sheet plants. And again, our commitment is to bring this business to sustainable returns above our cost of capital. 
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 9. Price and mix was favorable with price realization accelerating across all pulp segments in the first quarter. Volume was moderately lower due to the shipping delays related to port congestion. Demand for fluff is solid and we have healthy backlogs. 
Operations and costs improved sequentially, driven by the nonrepeat of the $20 million write-off in the fourth quarter as well as solid operations and good cost management. These improvements were partially offset by about $10 million of higher energy consumption and an FX loss at our mill in Canada. 
Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected, and input costs increased due to higher wood costs in the Mid-Atlantic region as well as higher energy costs. Demand improved as we entered the year and the end-use demand signals for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 10. Our business -- our papers business has demonstrated outstanding resilience throughout the past year. Our performance reflects the talent and commitment of our team, the scale and capabilities of our global footprint and the strength of our highly valued brands. We continue to see steady recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return to office and return-to-school activity. 
I'd also add that we've seen significant improvement in supply-demand dynamics both within the U.S. and outside the U.S. Looking at our first quarter performance, price and mix was stable across the segment. Volume decreased sequentially due to the lower seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia as expected. It also meant that the export supply chains are stretched in most regions. Operations and costs improved on solid operations and good cost management, as well as a favorable FX in Brazil of about $10 million. 
Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by 40,000 tons sequentially across the system. Maintenance outages increased modestly, as expected, and input costs increased primarily due to higher wood and energy costs in North America. 
Looking at Ilim on Slide 11. The joint venture delivered $49 million in equity earnings in the first quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 35%, driven by higher average pricing. Volume decreased sequentially, primarily due to fewer shipping days because of the Chinese New Year, as well as the impact of tight shipping capacity in China. Underlying demand remained strong as we enter the second quarter. And lastly, in April, we saved a $144 million dividend payment from Ilim, which is $44 million higher than the estimate we provided last quarter. 
Now we can turn to the outlook on Slide 12, and starting with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $75 million on realization of our March 2021 price increase. Volume is expected to decrease by $10 million on lower seasonal demand in Spain and Morocco as the citrus season winds down. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million, with the full recovery of the winter storm impact partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals related to a stronger outlook. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $77 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $20 million due to higher OCC, energy, raw materials and distribution costs. 
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $100 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $10 million, and input costs are expected to be stable. 
Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million due to the nonrepeat of foreign currency gain in Brazil during the first quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $22 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million. And under equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. 
Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the first quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have no significant near-term maturities. And in the first quarter, we reduced debt by $108 million. We also returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases, which represented about 2.6 million shares at an average price of $50.28. 
We acquired 2 box plants in Spain at the end of the first quarter. You can expect M&A to continue to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in North America and Europe. And lastly, in the first quarter, we monetized about $400 million of our stake in Graphic Packaging. After that transaction, we now hold about 7.4% ownership in the partnership. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

As we enter the second quarter, I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic, and there is still significant uncertainty in the geographies and markets that we operate. Having said that, we see momentum building in our 3 businesses. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard in North America and Europe. We're also seeing solid demand for absorbent pulp with more favorable supply and demand dynamics as paper-grade pulp demand recovers. In Printing Papers, we're seeing a steady recovery in demand. And in areas where schools and offices have reopened, we're seeing a step change improvement. Overall, we're seeing a much better supply/demand backdrop. 
We expect price flow-through from prior price increases across our 3 businesses. We expect margins to improve, even as we manage through the impact of higher input costs for recovered fiber, energy and transportation. In addition, we expect productivity and other cost initiatives to offset general inflation. All of this contributes to a more favorable outlook for 2021. 
And I'll end our prepared remarks on Slide 15. I just want to take a moment to reflect on what has now been a full year of living and working in a global pandemic environment. When we shared our first quarter performance last year, we talked about all the protocols we quickly put in place to keep our employees and contractors safe so that we could continue taking care of our customers. We stayed diligent about adhering to those protocols, and we will remain steadfast for as long as it takes to get fully and safely pass the pandemic. We continue to operate in this environment with a view towards the short-term and long-term success and sustainability of International Paper for all of our stakeholders, with an unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contractors, to understanding and taking care of our customers' needs as they also adapt to rapid change, to supporting the critical needs in our communities and to building a better IP for all of our stakeholders. 
Since the pandemic began, not a day goes by that I don't think about the commitment of our employees, and especially our frontline teams for their ability to adapt well and perform at a high level across circumstances and geographies. And once again, I want to take this time to thank each of our employees for their role in making our company strong and resilient. 
And with that, Tim and I are happy to take your questions."

We obviously  have looked at that and what product we might need in the future. If you just play out the current conditions, you'd probably look at using some of that from a packaging standpoint sooner. 
But outside of interruptions like we talked about with the winter storm and one-offs, we have largely the containerboard we need when you look at all of our channels, domestic and our own box, domestic open market and export for what we believe is the foreseeable future. But that's a good option for us in the future. And it depends on the type of grades, whether it's medium or linerboard that we need. One is quicker and less expensive than the other.

So can you tell us why -- what evidence you're seeing that suggests that and how your volumes have looked to the extent that you can comment early in the second quarter?"

I think one of the things we look at is what our customers look at. And on the e-commerce part of your question, we're seeing really important winning customers investing more in their capability, putting real dollars and real equipment and real capability and hiring employees. Their data analytics around customer repeat buying and all that gives them confidence to believe that a good portion of this shift to an e-commerce way of retail is permanent. It may not be 100% permanent, but it is the majority of it. So we look for clues from our customers instead of trying to wish it or guess at it. 
What's uncertain is as things return to a more ""normal environment"", what does traditional retail do? Is it a net loss to e-commerce? Or is it a hybrid? Were there still going to be some normal return to in-store brick-and-mortar type retail, and you can look at a lot of information, studies and listen to company's earnings reports that are in those businesses, and it's hard to conclude from that. So our box volumes in April for our own make box -- the boxes we make, looks -- the trends look like they're continuing from the first quarter. But I'll remind you, we serve multiple channels. So we're in the box market, whether we make the box, whether we have a long-term strategic partner using our containerboard and making specialty boxes or whether it's a pure open market, and we're seeing those volumes up close to double digit for the overall exposure we have for the North American box market. 
So it looks like more on the same. We do see some channel shifting, which is good news. We see obviously some foodservice and restaurant supply picking up. Where that shows up for IP, and we're overweight in this area is fresh food, produce, that plays that those restaurants buy twice weekly, 3x weekly basis, which really got hit hard in the pandemic. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing in the demand trends and the segment exposure that we have."

So I just don't want to get out over our skis and say for things that imply this is all behind us only to have to come back and say, what, that was too quick.

And hopefully, that gives people a sense of the big picture, which is things are really strong and improving.

International Paper delivered solid earnings and strong cash generation in the first quarter. Our mill and converting system performed well to mitigate the significant impact of the winter storm and support a strong customer demand across all of our packaging channels. Input costs and transportation were a headwind in the first quarter, especially for energy, which was impacted by the duration of the severe cold temperatures in the Southern U.S. 
We see momentum building, continuing to build across our 3 businesses with very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for absorbent pulp. And in papers, we're seeing an improved supply-demand backdrop in all of our key geographies. 
Our capital allocation in the first quarter, we repaid $108 million of debt and we returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases. 
Our performance again demonstrates the agility and resilience of International Paper to perform well across many different circumstances. We're passing the 1-year mark of the global pandemic, and I could not be any prouder of the commitment of our employees to take care of each other and take care of our customers. The vast majority of our 48,000 team members work in our mills and conversion plants each and every day, and their health and safety remains our most important responsibility. 
We also made solid progress on the spin-off of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete late in the third quarter this year. Our team is also making strong progress to develop and deliver multiple streams of earnings initiatives to achieve the $350 million to $400 million in incremental earnings and accelerated growth by the end of 2023. 
As we work to build a better IP, we remain laser-focused on delivering superior solutions to our customers, executing well and meeting our commitments to our shareowners and our other stakeholders. 
Turning now to Slide 4, which shows our first quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $730 million and free cash flow of $423 million despite the $80 million pretax earnings impact from the winter storm in the Southern U.S. Revenue increased by more than $100 million sequentially, primarily driven by price realization in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. And again, free cash flow is strong with a continued focus on running our businesses well, controlling our cost and actively managing our working capital. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our second quarter outlook.

I'll start with the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. First quarter operating earnings were $0.76. The winter storm impacted pretax earnings by $80 million or a $0.15 impact to operating EPS. We're still",1865,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning. I'll start with the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5. 
First quarter operating earnings were $0.76. The winter storm impacted pretax earnings by $80 million or a $0.15 impact to operating EPS. We're still in the very early stages of the insurance process and do not have a recovery estimate at this time. 
Looking at the bridge, price/mix was strong driven by prior period price flow-through and packaging and cellulose fibers. Volume was essentially flat with continued strong demand for corrugated packaging and absorbent pulp. Overall papers volume continues to recover even though we saw the expected seasonal decline for papers in Brazil in the first quarter. 
Operations and costs were favorable. Mill and box system performance was solid and helped mitigate the impact of the winter storm, which was a cost headwind of $55 million to operations. Maintenance costs increased sequentially, and we expect to complete about 65% of our maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Input costs were unfavorable, which included a $20 million cost impact from the storm, mostly for energy and raw materials such as starch and adhesives. Overall, we're seeing higher costs for recovered fiber, energy, chemicals and distribution, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. 
Transportation conditions are challenging, and we're experiencing significant rail, truck and ocean transportation congestion. Higher corporate expenses were driven by a noncash foreign exchange loss on intercompany loans, and lower equity earnings are partly attributed to the reduced ownership position in GPK.
Turning to the segments, and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong demand across all of our channels, including box, sheets and containerboard. For the quarter, volume was essentially flat. We lost 145,000 tons of containerboard production due to the winter storm. Although our mills and box plants in the region recovered quickly, the storm did impact sales in the quarter. We had nearly 30 box plants in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi affected by the storm, which impacted our box shipments in the quarter. 
Price and mix was strong. Our November increase is essentially implemented fully with the $131 million first quarter realization. And I would add, this is one of the fastest implementations that we've seen. 
Operations and cost includes about $55 million impact from the winter storm, about half of which is due to unabsorbed fixed costs and the balance is related to repairs and higher distribution costs. Overall, mill and box plant performance was solid, and we leveraged our system to support strong customer demand across all of our channels. 
Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially. We did defer about $30 million of maintenance outages from the first to the second quarter due to the significant production loss resulting from the winter storm. We expect to complete about 75% of our planned maintenance outages for packaging in the first half of the year. 
Input costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, including about $20 million related to the winter storm due to higher energy, distribution and raw materials in our mill system and box plants. Higher recovered fiber costs were another significant headwind in the quarter. We expect continued cost pressure for recovered fiber, energy distribution in the second quarter, and we're still seeing the lingering effects in certain chemicals produced in Texas and Louisiana as suppliers recover from the winter storm. 
Turning to Slide 7. As we enter the second quarter, we're seeing continued strong demand across all of our channels. U.S. and export containerboard demand is strong with low inventories in all regions. Our first quarter shipments were impacted by the significant production loss resulting from the storm. We're working with our customers to recover from extensive backlogs. 
In our U.S. box system demand remains robust as more states start lifting restrictions. E-commerce, again grew at a strong double-digit pace in the first quarter, and we believe the majority of the accelerated consumer adoption in this channel is permanent. 
With states starting to reopen, we're also seeing improved demand in segments with greater exposure to restaurant and foodservice channels, such as produce and protein, although we're still not back to pre-COVID levels. 
Nondurables, excluding food and beverage, represents about 30% of U.S. box demand across a wide range of consumer and industrial products. This segment is benefiting from strong consumer demand in the broad manufacturing sector recovery. And lastly, demand for durable goods, which had the immediate pullback due to COVID is benefiting from a healthy housing market. 
We're well positioned and have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a meaningful way, and our packaging team continues to focus on delivering superior packaging solutions to help our customers succeed. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'll provide an update on the progress we're making in our EMEA packaging business. Our objective is to bring this business back to sustainable mid-teen margins and generate returns above our cost of capital. We're well on our way to achieving our goal. 
In the first quarter, we improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $20 million compared with last year. The Madrid mill is fully ramped, and we have more integration and cost opportunities available. We're integrating our world-class lightweight recycled containerboard with our box network in Southern Europe to provide customers with a broader array of packaging solutions. 
We've improved our footprint in the Iberian Peninsula through selective acquisitions, including 2 box plants in Spain acquired at the end of the first quarter. These acquisitions provide additional integration opportunities with the Madrid mill. And more importantly, they enhance our commercial capabilities in the region. 
We continue to make progress with our box system performance and have more opportunity ahead. All our plants have clear commercial and operational plans, and we're leveraging the skills and resources from across the company to deliver on our commitments. 
The map on the slide shows our packaging footprint in Europe after the sale of our Turkey packaging business, which we expect to close in the second quarter. After the sale, the EMEA packaging business will have 2 recycled containerboard mills, 21 box plants and 2 sheet plants. And again, our commitment is to bring this business to sustainable returns above our cost of capital. 
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 9. Price and mix was favorable with price realization accelerating across all pulp segments in the first quarter. Volume was moderately lower due to the shipping delays related to port congestion. Demand for fluff is solid and we have healthy backlogs. 
Operations and costs improved sequentially, driven by the nonrepeat of the $20 million write-off in the fourth quarter as well as solid operations and good cost management. These improvements were partially offset by about $10 million of higher seasonal energy consumption and an FX loss at our mill in Canada. 
Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected, and input costs increased due to higher wood costs in the Mid-Atlantic region as well as higher energy costs. Demand improved as we entered the year and the end-use demand signals for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 10. Our business -- our papers business has demonstrated outstanding resilience throughout the past year. Our performance reflects the talent and commitment of our team, the scale and capabilities of our global footprint and the strength of our highly valued brands. We continue to see steady recovery in demand across all regions, which we expect will accelerate with broader return to office and return-to-school activity. 
I'd also add that we've seen significant improvement in supply-demand dynamics both within the U.S. and outside the U.S. Looking at our first quarter performance, price and mix was stable across the segment. Volume decreased sequentially due to the lower seasonal demand in Brazil and Russia as expected. It also meant that the export supply chains are stretched in most regions. Operations and costs improved on solid operations and good cost management, as well as a favorable FX in Brazil of about $10 million. 
Fixed cost absorption improved with economic downtime decreasing by 40,000 tons sequentially across the system. Maintenance outages increased modestly, as expected, and input costs increased primarily due to higher wood and energy costs in North America. 
Looking at Ilim on Slide 11. The joint venture delivered $49 million in equity earnings in the first quarter with an EBITDA margin of nearly 35%, driven by higher average pricing. Volume decreased sequentially, primarily due to fewer shipping days because of the Chinese New Year, as well as the impact of tight shipping capacity in China. Underlying demand remained strong as we enter the second quarter. And lastly, in April, we saved a $144 million dividend payment from Ilim, which is $44 million higher than the estimate we provided last quarter. 
Now we can turn to the outlook on Slide 12, and starting with Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $75 million on realization of our March 2021 price increase. Volume is expected to decrease by $10 million on lower seasonal demand in Spain and Morocco as the citrus season winds down. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $15 million, with the full recovery of the winter storm impact partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals related to a stronger outlook. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $77 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $20 million due to higher OCC, energy, raw materials and distribution costs. 
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $100 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $10 million, and input costs are expected to be stable. 
Turning to Printing Papers. We expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $10 million due to the nonrepeat of foreign currency gain in Brazil during the first quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $22 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $5 million. And under equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. 
Turning to Slide 13. I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the first quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have no significant near-term maturities. And in the first quarter, we reduced debt by $108 million. We also returned $331 million to shareholders, including $129 million of share repurchases, which represented about 2.6 million shares at an average price of $50.28. 
We acquired 2 box plants in Spain at the end of the first quarter. You can expect M&A to continue to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in North America and Europe. And lastly, in the first quarter, we monetized about $400 million of our stake in Graphic Packaging. After that transaction, we now hold about 7.4% ownership in the partnership. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

As we enter the second quarter, I'm mindful that we're still in the midst of a global pandemic, and there is still significant uncertainty in the geographies and markets that we operate. Having said that, we see momentum building in our 3 businesses. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard in North America and Europe. We're also seeing solid demand for absorbent pulp with more favorable supply and demand dynamics as paper-grade pulp demand recovers. In Printing Papers, we're seeing a steady recovery in demand. And in areas where schools and offices have reopened, we're seeing a step change improvement. Overall, we're seeing a much better supply/demand backdrop. 
We expect price flow-through from prior price increases across our 3 businesses. We expect margins to improve, even as we manage through the impact of higher input costs for recovered fiber, energy and transportation. In addition, we expect productivity and other cost initiatives to offset general inflation. All of this contributes to a more favorable outlook for 2021. 
And I'll end our prepared remarks on Slide 15. I just want to take a moment to reflect on what has now been a full year of living and working in a global pandemic environment. When we shared our first quarter performance last year, we talked about all the protocols we quickly put in place to keep our employees and contractors safe so that we could continue taking care of our customers. We stayed diligent about adhering to those protocols, and we will remain steadfast for as long as it takes to get fully and safely past the pandemic. We continue to operate in this environment with a view towards the short-term and long-term success and sustainability of International Paper for all of our stakeholders, with an unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contractors, to understanding and taking care of our customers' needs as they also adapt to rapid change, to supporting the critical needs in our communities and to building a better IP for all of our stakeholders. 
Since the pandemic began, not a day goes by that I don't think about the commitment of our employees, and especially our frontline teams for their ability to adapt well and perform at a high level across circumstances and geographies. And once again, I want to take this time to thank each of our employees for their role in making our company strong and resilient. 
And with that, Tim and I are happy to take your questions."

But that's a good option for us in the future. And it depends on the type of grades, whether it's medium or linerboard that we need. One is quicker and less expensive than the other. But it's on our radar screen. We don't feel the need to immediately do that right now. When we operate well and we don't have interruptions like we had in the first quarter, we feel quite confident in our containerboard quality, type of grade and overall capacity."

I think where we are right now is inventories are very low through the system with our customers and our own processes. And we are working individually with each of our customers, I can't speak for others, obviously, to make sure we can provide as much of their needs as possible in the time that they need it.

I think one of the things we look at is what our customers look at. And on the e-commerce part of your question, we're seeing really important winning customers, investing more in their capability, putting real dollars and real equipment and real capability and hiring employees. Their data analytics around customer repeat buying and all that gives them confidence to believe that a good portion of this shift to an e-commerce way of retail is permanent. It may not be 100% permanent, but it is the majority of it. So we look for clues from our customers instead of trying to wish it or guess at it. 
What's uncertain is as things return to a more ""normal environment"", what does traditional retail do? Is it a net loss to e-commerce? Or is it a hybrid? Were there still going to be some normal return to in-store brick-and-mortar type retail, and you can look at a lot of information, studies and listen to company's earnings reports that are in those businesses, and it's hard to conclude from that. So our box volumes in April for our own make box -- the boxes we make, looks -- the trends look like they're continuing from the first quarter. But I'll remind you, we serve multiple channels. So we're in the box market, whether we make the box, whether we have a long-term strategic partner using our containerboard and making specialty boxes or whether it's a pure open market, and we're seeing those volumes up close to double digit for the overall exposure we have for the North American box market. 
So it looks like more of the same. We do see some channel shifting, which is good news. We see obviously some foodservice and restaurant supply picking up. Where that shows up for IP, and we're overweight in this area is fresh food produce, the type of things restaurants buy twice weekly, 3x weekly basis, which really got hit hard in the pandemic. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing in the demand trends and the segment exposure that we have."

International Paper delivered solid earnings growth and strong cash generation in the second quarter. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for fluff pulp. And in our papers business, demand recovery accelerated in the second quarter across our key geographies. 
We grew revenue by 15% as compared to the second quarter of last year with price realization accelerating in all of our business segments. 
Our mills and converting system performed well. However, we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory across our packaging network due to 2 facts: The lingering effects of the winter storm in the first quarter and then our planned maintenance outages in the second quarter. 
These operating conditions severely stressed -- along the severely stressed transportation environments adversely affected volume and operating costs in the second quarter. 
Input costs and freight were a significant headwind in just about every category. I would call out the sharp rise in recovered fiber cost in North America and Europe. Although it certainly had a significant cost impact, it is another indication of the strong demand environment. 
Our Ilim joint venture delivered outstanding performance with equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter and a strong outlook as we move into the third quarter. 
On capital allocation, we're making significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million. We also returned $258 million to our shareowners, including $57 million of share repurchases. 
During the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging. I'm really pleased with the return on our investment. We structured the transaction in 2018, maximize the value of the Consumer Packaging business for our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we're making excellent progress on the spin-off of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete on October 1. 
Across IP, the team is doing an outstanding job managing complexity. We remain diligent in applying COVID-19 layers of protection for our employees and contractors. And I really appreciate our team's commitment to execute well, take care of each other, and take care of our customers as we work together to build a better IP for our shareholders and really all of our stakeholders. 
I'm going to turn to Slide 4 now, which shows our second quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $793 million and free cash flow of $633 million, which brings our free cash flow generation to more than $1 billion for the first half of 2021. 
Revenue increased by $750 million or 15% as compared to last year, driven by higher average prices in our 3 businesses as well as volume growth in our Packaging and Paper businesses. 
Margins improved sequentially with price realization outpacing higher input and transportation costs. We expect margins to expand meaningfully in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces rising input and transportation costs and importantly, as we step down from our highest maintenance quarter of the year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim?"

Second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.06 as compared to $0.76 in the first quarter. Price and mix improved by nearly $0.50 per share sequentially driven by very strong price realizations across all of our business segments. 
Volume was essentially flat versus last quarter. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong, and demand for fluff pulp is solid, while demand for papers continues to recover in all key regions. 
Second quarter volume in our North American packaging business was constrained by severely low containerboard inventory and fluff pulp shipments were hampered by significant forward congestion. 
Our mills and converting system performed well. Operating costs were adversely impacted by a highly stressed supply chain environment for both our inbound materials and outbound shipments as well as the exceptionally low containerboard inventory conditions in our North America packaging system. 
Maintenance outage costs increased by $0.18 sequentially as we completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. On an absolute level, maintenance calls were $250 million in the second quarter. 
Input costs were a significant headwind for most materials, and energy costs remained elevated, providing little relief on the store. OCC represented about half of the sequential increase in input costs. 
Although some of the pressure in input costs could be transitory, such as the impact of heavy rainfall on our wood cost in the Gulf region, the extremely tight transportation environment will continue to put pressure on all inbound materials. Every mode of transportation is tight, and we expect them to remain tight as we move to the second half of the year. 
Corporate expenses benefited from favorable reserve adjustments. Our tax rate of 24% in the second quarter was sequentially lower, primarily due to discrete period tax benefit, and equity earnings improved substantially on very strong performance from Ilim. 
Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. As Mark indicated, we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory in the U.S. system. These conditions impacted volume and operating costs in the quarter. We are working to replenish inventories following the winter storm and maintenance salvages as we manage through a tight transportation environment. 
Taking a look at our second quarter performance, volume was sequentially flat. Strong demand in our North American box and containerboard channels offset lower seasonal demand in our EMEA business. Volume across our U.S. channels grew by 10% as compared to last year, which includes our U.S. box system, open market containerboard customers as well as our recent equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders. 
Price and mix increased by about $110 million in the quarter. We're making excellent progress on the realization of our large increase. 
Our mills and converting systems performed well. However, operating costs were impacted by severely low containerboard inventories and stressed transportation environment with congestion across all [ nodes ]. Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially as we completed the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. 
In our Industrial Packaging business, we've completed about 75% of our planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year. 
Income costs were a significant headwind in the quarter primarily driven by higher costs for OCC, chemicals and distribution. About $10 million of the sequential increase in input costs occurred in our EMEA Packaging business, primarily for OCC and [indiscernible]. 
Taking a closer look at OCC. We consume about 5 million tons annually across our U.S. mill system and Spain. We see the rise in OCC cost as a reflection of the underlying strength in global demand for corrugated packaging. We expect OCC costs to rise further in the third quarter even as seasonal generation improves. We expect continued U.S. and export demand, especially from India and Southeast Asia, which were largely offsetting pre-restriction OCC exports to [indiscernible]. 
Turning to Slide 7. We're well positioned for strong earnings growth and margin expansion in our packaging business in the third and fourth quarter. Demand is strong across all of our channels. We expect continued robust volume growth across our U.S. channels, and we are making excellent progress on the price realization of our margin increase. 
Our mills and box clients are positioned for strong second half performance following the impact of the winter storms and the significant maintenance outages in the second quarter. Replenishing our containerboard inventories will enable operational and supply chain efficiencies as we move through the second half of the year. 
We do expect further input cost inflation in the third quarter with substantial pressure on OCC and transportation costs. Our teams are doing an admirable job managing costs in a tough environment. We expect further opportunities to be more efficient as inventory [indiscernible] us. In addition, our commercial initiatives are outpacing cost pressure and position us for strong margin expansion in the second half of the year. 
Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. Demand for fluff pulp is solid and the end-use demand signal for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. 
Looking at our sequential earnings price and mix improved by $104 million in the second quarter, with price realization accelerating across all regions and segments as expected. Volume was moderately lower due to significant U.S. port congestion and frequent vessel schedule changes, which delayed our shipments. 
Mill performance was strong. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight supply chain environment. We expect these conditions to continue in the third quarter. 
Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected and input costs were moderately higher with lower wood cost in the Mid-Atlantic region, offset by higher chemical and energy costs. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 9. Our papers business delivered earnings of $76 million in the second quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our Printing Papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the spin-off on October 1, and then continues to recover in all of our key regions. Additionally, our volume recovery is outpacing the industry through the strength of our global brands and commercial excellence. 
Looking at the second quarter performance. Price and mix improved by nearly $30 million with price realization across all regions. Fixed cost absorption improved with no economic downtime in our North American mill system. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight transportation environment. 
We executed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year as well. And on input costs, we experienced pressure on wood, chemicals and [ trip ]. 
As I said earlier, we're on track to spin off the Papers business on October 1. Separation planning is progressing well, and we expect to file the Form 10 with details of the spin off in the first half of August. 
As you would expect, there is significant complexity. Our teams are doing an outstanding job managing the business as we prepare for a successful separation. 
Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter with an EBITDA margin of 47%, driven by strong price realization for pulp and containerboard. Volume improved sequentially on strong demand for pulp and containerboard as well as more shipping days in the second quarter following the impact of the Chinese New Year in the prior quarter. 
Underlying demand is stable following inventory restructuring during the first half of 2021. Shipping capacity is [ tight ] and supply chains to China are stretched. Third quarter volume is expected to decrease moderately as Ilim executes the majority of its annual maintenance program. 
So now we'll turn to the outlook for the third quarter on Slide 12. As Mark said earlier, we expect meaningful earnings and margin expansion as we move to the third quarter. 
Looking at Industrial Packaging. We expect price and mix to improve by $110 million on the continued realization of our March 2021 price increase. Volume in North America is expected to improve by $10 million while volume in Europe is expected to decrease by $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to improve by $5 million, with the North American system benefiting from a gradual recovery and containerboard inventory levels. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expenses are expected to be down by $122 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $85 million with OCC representing about 60% of the expected increase. 
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $60 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $5 million on continued supply chain stress due to port congestion. 
Maintenance salaries expense is expected to decrease by $15 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million on higher wood and chemical costs. 
In Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to be unchanged. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $23 million, and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million primarily due to higher wood cost. 
And under the equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. 
I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're comfortable taking our leverage below the target range of 2.5 to 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. 
In the first quarter, we -- in the second quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million, bringing our debt reduction to $904 million in the first half of 2021. 
Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases were $57 million, which represented 1 million shares at an average price of [ $60.80 ]. We have about $1.5 billion available under the company share repurchase optimization at the end of the second quarter. 
Lastly, in the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging for about $400 million. This brings our total cash proceeds on the investment to $1.3 billion before expected cash taxes of about $300 million in the second half of 2021. 
As a reminder, we also have a tax receivable agreement with Graphic Packaging, under which we expect to receive about $100 million in cash proceeds during the second half of 2021. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

My confidence in making a statement stays on the following: Our commercial initiatives are driving revenue growth, and our mill and converting systems, we will be gaining meaningful operational and supply chain efficiency as we replenish inventories. Although rising input costs will likely linger, I'm certain we can successfully navigate the environment given the strong demand backdrop.

The adoption of e-commerce through the pandemic, which is, I think, proven to be very sticky, and valuable proposition that fiber-based packaging presents to people in terms of its circularity, renewal of natural resources, making energy and carbon neutral biomass way and a high recycling rate is finally -- with all the talk about sustainability and climate and a number of other issues, finally getting attention all the way down to the consumer level.

So I'm not concerned about losing anything permanently. We basically had a classic mismatch between the available capacity in our system and the demand in a 90-day period."

And on top of that, we had the highest maintenance quarter in IPG in the last 10 years. 
So if you just normalize what was above normal maintenance, plus that winter storm, that's a chunk of containerboard capacity that could not be converted into a box. And that's coming back. It's just going to take a little while to get it back. 
So what we had available, we had way open, but we had capacity offline for maintenance, and we had a lingering effect of the 140,000 tons from the first quarter. None of those are permanent. All of those will be significantly improved as we navigate through the second half."

But let me just kind of state -- restate what we talked about in the last 2 quarters, that, a, you could expect quarter -- quarter-over-quarter improvement in this business, steady improvement in this business, and we're seeing that. But our strategy is to have the kind of margins in this business that reflect the value that fluff pulp provides for the end-use customers. 
So we're taking a very structured, very measured approach to each market segment and to the agreements we currently have in those segments with individual customers. And so, as we implement this approach, we would expect that there'll be some volume shifts, some movement between segments. And our goal is to have mix improvement, better agreements with better economics that reflect the value of fluff pulp. And that is a kind of customer by customer, region of the world by region of the world, and I would expect, and we're making progress, good progress on that. But given the length of some of these agreements and the way they're structured, we should expect to continue to see margins improve over the next several quarters. 
So that's a long complicated answer to when we have any more price flow through. It's not just about price flow through. It's about restructuring these commercial agreements and getting a proper value for this product."

And the answer is coming in just maybe in the middle of 2020, we were saying, and I was saying, we feel really good about our containerboard capacity. We have what we need, the amount, the type of grades. 
When everything is running, we have enough capacity, but everything isn't run it every day with outages, and of course, events that you don't predict like that winter storm issue. 
But yes, we are looking continuously at debottlenecking. We've done a bunch of that in the last several years, thankfully because we need that containerboard now. We are looking at different options for adding containerboard into our system, if it looks like this kind of demand level is going to be consistent. 
Remember, we are structured maybe a little bit uniquely in the sense that we bring containerboard to market through 3 distinct channels, our own box network, open market in North America to companies that provide a certain service in the box market and have been long-term partners of ours, but we don't make the box and then our export. 
So what you have seen, and will continue to see, is movement of containerboard within those 3 channels. And obviously, we have favored the U.S. box market as much as we can but trying to continue over time, not just in the second quarter of 2021, but over time, get the highest possible margins in our business by participating in all 3 of those channels. 
Containerboard, you're right, is a high-demand product all over the world, both recycled and virgin, we have obviously only export in virgin. We sell the virgin version of it. 
Box capacity. We've been actively investing luckily with the acquisitions we did with that in the early part of the past period. We had a lot of opportunities to fill out existing plants by adding single or double lines of box-making equipment. 
We've built a few plants, and we've acquired a couple of partnerships, but there's definitely opportunity for us to continue to invest in our converting network. 
The other option with converting, as you well know, Mark, is when you know demand looks like it's going to be solid, you can bring on more employees and actually fill out an extra shift in many plants and you've got latent capacity turned into productive capacity. You obviously want to do that when you're pretty sure and you're first to do it with overtime and then you do it with permanent employees. 
That's a challenge right now given the labor market dynamics, but we've got several levers to pull to continue to invest in not only box capacity, but the kind of capability we have, e-commerce-specific assets, for example, is something that we're also linking to market."

And we are actively working in the state-by-state legislatures. 
The big issue, and the big goal of this extended producer responsibility type legislation, it was really targeted nonrecyclable or hard to recycle. In many cases, plastics. In some cases, that has led people to believe all of packaging should be included. 
So the first thing is separating the facts of what corrugated packaging can do and actually, corrugated packaging could be solution to the problem because of the high recycling rates. But that message has to get to policymakers, and we work very hard on that. I spend a fair amount of my personal time talking to people about that. 
And in many cases, it's a new learning mark for people at the local level that there is a completely different story on fiber-based packaging that's made from the renewable resource and a high recycling rate in the 90% range versus many of the other substrate choices. So I think that's the case we're making. That is actually part of the solution, not part of the problem. 
But as usual, in legislation sometimes it starts with a blanket. All packaging needs to be managed in a different way, and people need to be responsible for their packaging that they put out there when we have a system. So for example, we spent a lot of time, and it's in there, right now, on the infrastructure work that commerce is working on. In that bipartisan agreement they made yesterday, a significant amount of investment in recycling networks in the country is part of that. We'll see if it stays in there. 
But that's the answer is improving recycling rates for easy to recycle and reuse materials. That's the value proposition for corrugated packaging, not being included  in the intent of some of that legislation."

I mean, it's hard to predict that with certainty, obviously, but we believe that part of what's happening is the goal that fiber-based packaging is playing in general commerce, driven by a few segments has taken a step change up. And so we think the base will be stronger. 
It depends on a lot of things, and number one, the structure of the U.S. economy. And so, if there is really action on some of the things that are being learned now around supply chains and global issues with supply chains, and we do have more manufacturing that actually occurs in the U.S. for certain components, I think that will bode well for the business, and how strong the consumer is going forward coming out of this. I think you're looking at maybe what's going to be close to 2 years of pent-up demand by consumers because of the things that happened during the pandemic and how that plays out in consumption will play a big role and what that growth rate is going to be. 
I think the data -- we have this model we use. I know others have models, there's third parties that have models, a correlation around GDP has been slightly less -- has been less happened in the box market, and we think that will still stand. And it looks like we're poised to have a stronger consumption-oriented GDP for at least as far as you can see right now."

But on the longer term, we believe that the combination of how we operate, so in the manufacturing sector and the kind the cost structure of our mill system, and I've said this before, especially the part that was the legacy IP mill system, which is mostly converted mills from other products versus what we acquired with warehouse for which is mostly all built for purpose. So they tend to have a better efficiency and lower cost. We've got opportunities to lower the cost, primarily in the legacy IP manufacturing system, coupled that with the commercial arrangements, improvements that we're talking about and what we're doing now. You put those 2 together, we should have the margin structure to have a solidly -- solid business above the cost of capital with a slight growth potential. So that's what we are working on, and we see a path to that. It will be a steady path quarter-by-quarter, and that's where we're headed.

We're continuing to invest in that segment. Food service continuing to improve, I guess, there's a question mark about what happens with the Delta variant and COVID and whether everything continues to open. I think a big question or a big potential upside as schools and events start to open foodservice related to those, which obviously hasn't been opened during the summer is another potential upside. If that, in any way, shape or form gets delayed and the foodservice growth could slow a little bit. 
The only segment that I think, and it's kind of predictable that maybe saw some flattening was processed foods. And I think it's directly related to the general opening of the economy and a little less stocking up of kind of the center of the grocery store, if you will.

And what that means is make a product in the right factory so that the transportation cost to the customer, or in the case of our Industrial Packaging business, our containerboard mill makes containerboard from box plants that are nearby, not box plants that are all the way across the country. So that's the #1 thing on cost that we can do internally. We don't have our own trucking company or anything like that. It's about really optimizing our supply chain and dramatic improvements we can make on cost. 
To your first part of your question, I don't know this for sure, but looking at what the analysts that follow the transportation industry talk about is that there is a belief that labor and some of the impediments to truck capacity and the training that's required to bring on more employees and more assets in the rail industry will get better, that people will want to return to those industries. Many of those companies laid off a lot of people. You can't just bring people back in rail. There's required training and other things. Same thing for truck. And the belief is that will get better. So capacity should get better. 
If the economy stays kind of red hot, it's a good problem to have, but then I think capacity will get absorbed pretty quickly. So the jury now, we think it's really disruptive right now. Velocity is really slow for a lot of reasons. We think part of that, at least on the human labor side, will get better. 
Let me go ahead and wrap up. Just a couple of takeaways. I would like to leave with investors. 
First, you heard today that we are really positive on the strong momentum we're building for the second half in both earnings and margin expansion. We're absolutely laser-focused on capital allocation and a balanced approach to that, and we are in very good shape on all elements of our capital allocation framework. And we're very excited about the prospects we have in front of us as we separate IP into 2 companies, and we work on building a better IP going forward.

International Paper delivered solid earnings growth and strong cash generation in the second quarter. We continue to see very strong demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard and solid demand for fluff pulp. And in our papers business, demand recovery accelerated in the second quarter across our key geographies. We grew revenue by 15% as compared to the second quarter of last year with price realization accelerating in all of our business segments.  
Our mills and converting system performed well. However, we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory across our packaging network due to two facts: the lingering effects of the winter storm in the first quarter and then our planned maintenance outages in the second quarter. These operating conditions severely stressed -- along with severely stressed transportation environments, adversely affected volume and operating costs in the second quarter. 
Input costs and freight were a significant headwind in just about every category. I would call out the sharp rise in recovered fiber cost in North America and Europe. Although it certainly had a significant cost impact, it is another indication of the strong demand environment. Our Ilim joint venture delivered outstanding performance with equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter and a strong outlook as we move into the third quarter. 
On capital allocation, we're making significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million. We also returned $258 million to our shareowners, including $57 million of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging. I'm really pleased with the return on our investment. We structured the transaction in 2018, maximized the value of the Consumer Packaging business for our shareholders.  
Looking ahead, we're making excellent progress on the spinoff of our Printing Papers business, which we expect to complete on October 1. Across IP, the team is doing an outstanding job managing complexity. We remain diligent in applying COVID-19 layers of protection for our employees and contractors. And I really appreciate our team's commitment to execute well, take care of each other and take care of our customers as we work together to build a better IP for our shareholders and really all of our stakeholders.  
I'm going to turn to Slide 4 now, which shows our second quarter results. We delivered EBITDA of $793 million and free cash flow of $633 million, which brings our free cash flow generation to more than $1 billion for the first half of 2021. Revenue increased by $750 million or 15% as compared to last year, driven by higher average prices in our three businesses as well as volume growth in our packaging and paper businesses.  
Margins improved sequentially with price realization outpacing higher input and transportation costs. We expect margins to expand meaningfully in the second half of the year as price realization outpaces rising input and transportation costs and importantly as we step down from our highest maintenance quarter of the year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance as well as our third quarter outlook. Tim?"

Second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.06 as compared to $0.76 in the first quarter. Price and mix improved by nearly $0.50 per share sequentially, driven by very strong price realizations across all of our business segments. 
Volume was essentially flat versus last quarter. Demand for corrugated packaging is very strong and demand for fluff pulp is solid while demand for papers continues to recover in all key regions. Second quarter volume in our North American packaging business was constrained by severely low containerboard inventory and fluff pulp shipments were hampered by significant forward congestion. 
Our mills and converting system performed well. Operating costs were adversely impacted by a highly stressed supply chain environment for both our inbound materials and outbound shipments as well as the exceptionally low containerboard inventory conditions in our North America packaging system. Maintenance outage costs increased by $0.18 sequentially as we completed our highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. On an absolute level, maintenance costs were $250 million in the second quarter. 
Input costs were a significant headwind for most materials, and energy costs remained elevated, providing little relief following the winter storm. OCC represented about half of the sequential increase in input costs. Although some of the pressure in input costs could be transitory, such as the impact of heavy rainfall on our wood cost in the Gulf region, the extremely tight transportation environment will continue to put pressure on all inbound materials. Every mode of transportation is tight, and we expect them to remain tight as we move to the second half of the year. 
Corporate expenses benefited from favorable reserve adjustments. Our tax rate of 24% in the second quarter was sequentially lower, primarily due to discrete period tax benefit. And equity earnings improved substantially on very strong performance from Ilim.  
Turning to the segments and starting with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We continue to see strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. As Mark indicated, we operated with extremely low containerboard inventory in the U.S. system. These conditions impacted volume and operating costs in the quarter. We are working to replenish inventories following the winter storm and maintenance salvages as we manage through a tight transportation environment.  
Taking a look at our second quarter performance, volume was sequentially flat. Strong demand in our North American box and containerboard channels offset lower seasonal demand in our EMEA business. Volume across our U.S. channels grew by 10% as compared to last year, which includes our U.S. box system, open market containerboard customers as well as our recent equity partnerships with strategic sheet feeders. Price and mix increased by about $110 million in the quarter. We're making excellent progress on the realization of our barge increase.  
Our mills and converting systems performed well. However, operating costs were impacted by severely low containerboard inventories and stressed transportation environment with congestion across all modes. Maintenance outage costs increased sequentially as we completed the highest maintenance outage quarter of the year. In our Industrial Packaging business, we've completed about 75% of our planned maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Income costs were a significant headwind in the quarter, primarily driven by higher costs for OCC, chemicals and distribution. About $10 million of the sequential increase in input costs occurred in our EMEA Packaging business, primarily for OCC and energy.  
Taking a closer look at OCC. We consume about 5 million tons annually across our U.S. mill system and Spain. We see the rise in OCC cost as a reflection of the underlying strength in global demand for corrugated packaging. We expect OCC costs to rise further in the third quarter even as seasonal generation improves. We expect continued U.S. and export demand, especially from India and Southeast Asia, which were largely offsetting pre-restriction OCC exports to China.  
Turning to Slide 7. We're well positioned for strong earnings growth and margin expansion in our packaging business in the third and fourth quarter. Demand is strong across all of our channels. We expect continued robust volume growth across our U.S. channels. And we are making excellent progress on the price realization of our margin increase. Our mills and box clients are positioned for strong second half performance following the impact of the winter storms and the significant maintenance outages in the second quarter. 
Replenishing our containerboard inventories will enable operational and supply chain efficiencies as we move through the second half of the year. We do expect further input cost inflation in the third quarter with the substantial pressure on OCC and transportation costs. Our teams are doing an admirable job managing costs in a tough environment. We expect further opportunities to be more efficient as inventory [indiscernible]. In addition, our commercial initiatives are outpacing cost pressure and position us for strong margin expansion in the second half of the year.  
Turning to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 8. Demand for fluff pulp is solid and the end-use demand signal for absorbent hygiene products is healthy. Looking at our sequential earnings, price and mix improved by $104 million in the second quarter with price realization accelerating across all regions and segments as expected. Volume was moderately lower due to significant U.S. port congestion and frequent vessel schedule changes, which delayed our shipments.  
Mill performance was strong. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight supply chain environment. We expect these conditions to continue in the third quarter. Maintenance outage costs decreased as expected and input costs were moderately higher with lower wood cost in the Mid-Atlantic region offset by higher chemical and energy costs.  
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 9. Our papers business delivered earnings of $76 million in the second quarter with continued strong cash generation. Our Printing Papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the spinoff on October 1 and then continues to recover in all of our key regions. Additionally, our volume recovery is outpacing the industry through the strength of our global brands and commercial excellence.  
Looking at the second quarter performance. Price and mix improved by nearly $30 million with price realization across all regions. Fixed cost absorption improved with no economic downtime in our North American mill system. However, operating costs were impacted by the tight transportation environment. We executed the heaviest maintenance outage quarter of the year as well. And on input costs, we experienced pressure on wood, chemicals and freight.  
As I said earlier, we're on track to spin off the papers business on October 1. Separation planning is progressing well and we expect to file the Form 10 with details of the spinoff in the first half of August. As you would expect, there is significant complexity. Our teams are doing an outstanding job managing the business as we prepare for a successful separation.  
Looking at the Ilim results on Slide 10. The joint venture delivered equity earnings of $101 million in the second quarter with an EBITDA margin of 47%, driven by strong price realization for pulp and containerboard. Volume improved sequentially on strong demand for pulp and containerboard as well as more shipping days in the second quarter following the impact of the Chinese New Year in the prior quarter. Underlying demand is stable following inventory restructuring during the first half of 2021. Shipping capacity is tight and supply chains to China are stretched. Third quarter volume is expected to decrease moderately as Ilim executes the majority of its annual maintenance program.  
So now we'll turn to the outlook for the third quarter on Slide 12. As Mark said earlier, we expect meaningful earnings and margin expansion as we move through the third quarter. Looking at Industrial Packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $110 million on the continued realization of our March 2021 price increase. Volume in North America is expected to improve by $10 million while volume in Europe is expected to decrease by $10 million. 
Operations and costs are expected to improve by $5 million with the North American system benefiting from a gradual recovery and containerboard inventory levels. Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expenses are expected to be down by $122 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $85 million with OCC representing about 60% of the expected increase.  
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to increase by $60 million on realization of prior price movements. Volume is expected to increase by $10 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $5 million on continued supply chain stress due to port congestion. Maintenance salaries expense is expected to decrease by $15 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $10 million on higher wood and chemical costs.  
In Printing Papers, we expect price and mix to increase by $25 million. Volume is expected to increase by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to be unchanged. Maintenance outage expense is expected to decrease by $23 million and input costs are expected to increase by $10 million primarily due to higher wood cost. And under the equity earnings, you'll see the outlook for our Ilim joint venture. 
I want to take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the quarter. We're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're comfortable taking our leverage below the target range of 2.5 to 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the first quarter, we -- in the second quarter, we reduced debt by $796 million, bringing our debt reduction to $904 million in the first half of 2021.  
Returning cash to shareholders is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases were $57 million, which represented 1 million shares at an average price of $60.80. We have about $1.5 billion available under the company's share repurchase optimization at the end of the second quarter.  
Lastly, in the second quarter, we monetized our remaining stake in Graphic Packaging for about $400 million. This brings our total cash proceeds on the investment to $1.3 billion before expected cash taxes of about $300 million in the second half of 2021.

As we look forward, we're positioned for strong earnings and margin expansion in the second half of 2021. My confidence in making a statement stays on the following: our commercial initiatives are driving revenue growth and our mill and converting systems will be gaining meaningful operational and supply chain efficiency as we replenish inventories. 
Although rising input costs will likely linger, I'm certain we can successfully navigate the environment given the strong demand backdrop. Our papers business carries strong momentum as we approach the October 1 spinoff. Our team is doing an outstanding job managing the business and taking care of our customers. And I want to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tireless efforts as we plan for a successful separation. 
As we move through 2021, we had significant operating and nonoperating cash catalyst. And we are laser-focused on the capital allocation framework that Tim just described. All of our cash will flow through our framework with one objective: maximizing value creation for our shareowners. I'm excited about the actions we're taking to build a better IP. We're accelerating earnings growth and building a foundation for long-term success. And we're looking forward to sharing more about that with you in the months ahead. 
With that, we're ready to take your questions."

The adoption of e-commerce through the pandemic, which is, I think, proven to be very sticky, and valuable proposition that fiber-based packaging presents to people in terms of its circularity, renewable natural resources, making energy in a carbon-neutral biomass way and a high recycling rate is finally -- with all the talk about sustainability and climate and a number of other issues, finally getting attention all the way down to the consumer level.

So our inventory view in IP for the next quarter and the quarter after that is also influenced and adjusted by what's happening in the transportation and supply chain network.

And the answer is coming in just maybe in the middle of 2020, we were saying and I was saying that we feel really good about our containerboard capacity. We have what we need, the amount, the type of grades. When everything is running, we have enough capacity. But everything isn't run it every day with outages and, of course, events that you don't predict, like that winter storm issue. But yes, we are looking continuously at debottlenecking. We've done a bunch of that in the last several years, thankfully because we need that containerboard now. 
We are looking at different options for adding containerboard into our system if it looks like this kind of demand level is going to be consistent. Remember, we are structured maybe a little bit uniquely in the sense that we bring containerboard to market through three distinct channels, our own box network, open market in North America to companies that provide a certain service in the box market and have been long-term partners of ours, but we don't make the box and then our export. So what you have seen and will continue to see is movement of containerboard within those three channels. 
And obviously, we have favored the U.S. box market as much as we can but trying to continue over time, not just in the second quarter of 2021, but over time, get the highest possible margins in our business by participating in all three of those channels. Containerboard, you're right, is a high-demand product all over the world, both recycled and virgin. We have obviously only export the virgin, we sell the virgin version of it. Box capacity, we've been actively investing. Luckily with the acquisitions we did with that in the early part of the past period, we had a lot of opportunities to fill out existing plants by adding single or double lines of box-making equipment. We've built a few plants and we've acquired a couple of partnerships, but there's definitely opportunity for us to continue to invest in our converting network. 
The other option with converting, as you well know, Mark, is when you know demand looks like it's going to be solid, you can bring on more employees and actually fill out an extra shift in many plants and you've got latent capacity turned into productive capacity. You obviously want to do that when you're pretty sure and you first do it with overtime and then you do it with permanent employees. That's a challenge right now, given the labor market dynamics. But we've got several levers to pull to continue to invest in not only box capacity but the kinds of capability we have. E-commerce-specific assets, for example, is something that we're also bringing to market."

And we are actively working in the state-by-state legislatures. The big issue and the big goal of this extended producer responsibility-type legislation, it was really targeted nonrecyclable or hard to recycle, in many cases, plastics. In some cases, that has led people to believe all of packaging should be included. So the first thing is separating the facts of what corrugated packaging can do. And actually, corrugated packaging could be a solution to the problem because of the high recycling rates. 
But that message has to get to policymakers, and we work very hard on that. I spend a fair amount of my personal time talking to people about that. And in many cases, it's a new learning mark for people at the local level that there is a completely different story on fiber-based packaging that's made from the renewable resource and a high recycling rate in the 90% range versus many of the other substrate choices. So I think that's the case we're making, that is actually part of the solution, not part of the problem but as usual, in legislation sometimes it starts with a blanket, all packaging needs to be managed in a different way and people need to be responsible for their packaging that they put out there when we have a system. 
So for example, we spend a lot of time, and it's in there right now, on the infrastructure work that commerce is working on. In that bipartisan agreement they made yesterday, a significant amount of investment in recycling networks in the country is part of that. We'll see if it stays in there. But that's the answer is in improving recycling rates for easy-to-recycle and reuse materials. That's the value proposition for corrugated packaging, not being included in the intent of some of that legislation."

I think you're looking at maybe what's going to be close to 2 years of pent-up demand by consumers because of the things that happened during the pandemic and how that plays out in consumption will play a big role in what that growth rate is going to be.

And then we're getting into the period of the year where you start to build for the year-end demand increases as you move toward holiday season, so still a very strong story. We're continuing to invest in that segment. Foodservice continuing to improve. I guess, there's a question mark about what happens with the delta variant and COVID and whether everything continues to open. I think a big question or a big potential upside is as schools and events start to open, foodservice related to those, which obviously hasn't been opened during the summer, is another potential upside. If that, in any way, shape or form, gets delayed, then foodservice growth could slow a little bit. 
The only segment that I think, and it's kind of predictable, that maybe saw some flattening was processed foods. And I think it's directly related to the general opening of the economy and a little less stocking up of kind of the center of the grocery store, if you will. So good strong performance across the key segments. And we believe listening to our customers and looking at order patterns, that's continuing as we go into the third quarter."

And what that means is make a product in the right factory so that the transportation cost to the customer, or in the case of our Industrial Packaging business, our containerboard mill makes containerboard for box plants that are nearby, not box plants that are all the way across the country. So that's the #1 thing on cost that we can do internally. We don't have our own trucking company or anything like that. It's about really optimizing our supply chain and any dramatic improvements we can make on cost. 
To your first part of your question, I don't know this for sure, but looking at what the analysts that follow the transportation industry talk about is that there is a belief that labor and some of the impediments to truck capacity and the training that's required to bring on more employees and more assets in the rail industry will get better, that people will want to return to those industries. Many of those companies laid off a lot of people. You can't just bring people back in rail. 
There's required training and other things. Same thing for truck. And the belief is that, that will get better. So capacity should get better. If the economy stays kind of red hot, it's a good problem to have, but then I think capacity will get absorbed pretty quickly. So the jury now is that we think it's really disruptive right now. Velocity is really slow for a lot of reasons. We think part of that, at least on the human labor side, will get better. 
Let me go ahead and wrap up. Just a couple of takeaways I would like to leave with investors. First, you heard today that we are really positive on the strong momentum we're building for the second half in both earnings and margin expansion. We're absolutely laser-focused on capital allocation and a balanced approach to that. And we are in very good shape on all elements of our capital allocation framework. And we're very excited about the prospects we have in front of us as we separate IP into two companies and we work on building a better IP going forward. 
So thank you for your interest in International Paper. We look forward to talking with all of you next quarter."

In the third quarter, International Paper grew revenue, earnings and margins, and we continued to generate strong cash from operations. We continue to see strong demand for corrugated packaging and solid demand for absorbent pulp. We're making strong progress on price realization from our prior increases. 
Having said that, the supply chain and input cost environment remains very challenging and it impacted our results much more than we anticipated. The widespread supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with a strong level of demand that we're seeing. 
Our mills performed well. However, stretched supply chains impacted volume in our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses. 
Containerboard inventories in our packaging network improved in the latter part of the third quarter, and we are in a much better position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter. 
Input costs in the third quarter rose by about $230 million or $0.46 per share, which was more than 2x what we had anticipated, with cost pressure in just about every category. 
Our Ilim joint venture delivered another strong performance, with equity earnings of $95 million. 
On capital allocation, we continue to make significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million. 
I would also highlight that our pension plan is fully funded. This is a significant milestone that further strengthens the company. 
In the third quarter, we also returned $411 million to our shareholders, including $212 million of share repurchases. 
On October 1, we completed the spin-off of the Printing Papers business. IP received a $1.4 billion payment from Sylvamo, and we retained a 19.9% interest in the new company, which we intend to monetize within 1 year. The teams did an outstanding job executing the transaction in a very challenging environment. The Printing Papers business delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, and we wish Sylvamo all the best as they move forward as a stand-alone company. 
We are laser-focused on strengthening the company and building a better IP for all of our stakeholders. Tim and I will share more about the progress we're making during today's discussion. 
Turning now to Slide 4. We delivered EBITDA of $938 million and free cash flow of $519 million in the third quarter, which brings our free cash flow nearly $1.6 billion year-to-date. 
Revenue increased by nearly $600 million or 12% when compared to last year. And if we exclude the Printing Papers business, third quarter revenue grew by 14% as compared to last year. 
We also expanded our margins in the third quarter with realization of our prior price increases. We expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. 
I will now turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?"

Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5, third quarter operating earnings per share were $1.35 as compared to $1.06 in the second quarter. Price and mix improved by $0.43 per share, with strong price realization across the 3 businesses. Volume decreased sequentially. Supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefit of a strong demand backdrop. We replenished our containerboard inventories in the latter part of the third quarter, which positions us well entering the seasonally strong fourth quarter. 
In our Cellulose Fibers business, demand for absorbent pulp is solid. Our pulp shipments were constrained due to significant port congestion and our backlogs remain stretched. 
Our mills performed well. Operating costs benefited by about $35 million of onetime items, including the sale of nitrogen credits and insurance recovery related to the winter storm earlier this year. 
Supply chains are stretched, and transportation costs are elevated for both inbound materials and outbound shipments. Every mode of transportation is tight, and we expect the transportation environment to remain tight for the foreseeable future. 
Maintenance costs decreased as expected. Input costs rose by $0.46 per share or about $230 million, which is more than double what we had anticipated for the quarter. Higher fiber and energy cost accounted for about 80% of this increase. 
Corporate expenses were essentially flat. 
Tax expense was lower by $0.04 per share in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate of 18% as compared to 21% in the second quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to our federal tax provision after finalizing our 2020 tax return in the third quarter. 
Equity earnings were lower sequentially following the final monetization of our stake in GPK in the second quarter. 
Turning to the segments, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We are seeing strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. Third quarter shipment across our U.S. channels improved by 1.3% year-over-year. However, box shipments were hampered by low containerboard inventories and stretched supply chains. 
We successfully replenished inventories across our box system in the latter part of the third quarter, which puts us in a much better inventory position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter. We expect supply chains to remain stretched for the foreseeable future, which requires us to carry more inventory given the slower velocity across our network. 
To put the velocity into context, our middle to box plant containerboard supply chain is currently running 3 to 4 days longer than our normalized flow, and in some lanes, even longer. 
Taking a look at third quarter performance. Price and mix was strong. Our March increase is essentially fully implemented, with $128 million of price realization in the third quarter. Volume was lower by $45 million. Box shipments in North America were impacted by low containerboard inventory, especially in the first half of the quarter. Volume in EMEA was seasonally lower, as expected, representing about $10 million of the sequential decrease. Operations and costs were essentially flat sequentially. Our mill system performed at 100% and provided much needed inventory relief to our box system. In the third quarter, we also received insurance proceeds of about $15 million related to the winter storm. These benefits were largely offset by unplanned maintenance costs. 
We are not seeing any relief on supply chain costs and are managing risk associated with transportation capacity and congestion across the rail and truck networks. 
Input costs increased by nearly $190 million in the quarter. OCC and wood fiber accounted for $120 million of that total. Energy accounted for another $45 million, primarily in our recycled containerboard mills and our box plants. 
Taking a closer look at fiber, our North American packaging fiber mix is around 65% virgin wood and 35% OCC. Wood fiber costs rose sharply in the third quarter due to continued wet conditions across the Southern and Eastern regions as well as inbound transportation constraints. Wood inventories are below our control limits, and we expect difficult operating conditions again in the fourth quarter. 
We expect demand for OCC to remain strong, with no cost relief even as generation gradually improves. As a reminder, we consume about 4.5 million tons annually in the U.S. and nearly 0.5 million tons in EMEA. 
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 7. The business delivered earnings of $96 million. Third quarter segment earnings included $13 million from the Sylvamo subsidiary and foods and mill, which are no longer part of our operations in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at our sequential earnings, price and mix improved by $59 million. Volume improved by $11 million sequentially. Demand for fluff pulp, which represents about 75 of our -- 75% of our mix remained solid. 
Our shipments continue to be negatively impacted by unprecedented port congestion and vessel delays. Keep in mind that we export about 90% of our volume in this business. The majority of this is fluff pulp that ships in containers which is where port congestion is especially challenging. We have systems in place to manage through this environment. However, vessel delays and higher supply chain costs are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 
Our mills performed well. We also benefited from about $20 million of onetime items related to the sale of nitrogen credits and lower corporate costs in the quarter. These benefits were largely offset by $50 million of higher supply chain costs for export operations. 
Maintenance outage costs decreased sequentially, while input costs were a significant headwind in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher wood and chemical costs. 
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 8. The business delivered earnings of $106 million in the third quarter, with strong momentum ahead of the spinoff. Third quarter results includes the Kwidzyn mill until the sale on August 6. Performance in the third quarter was strong with continued demand recovery globally and price realization outpacing rising input costs. 
Now that the spin-off is complete, the historical results of the business will be treated as a discontinued operation with a full recast of previous periods. And going forward, activity pertaining to the printing papers offtake agreement for Riverdale George sale will be included in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fiber segment earnings. 
I do want to echo Mark's sentiment and thank our teams for successfully executing the spin in a very challenging environment. 
Looking to the Ilim results on Slide 9. The joint venture delivered another quarter of strong performance with equity earnings of $95 million and an EBITDA margin of 44%. Solid price realization for pulp and containerboard were partially offset by lower volume due to high planned maintenance outages in the quarter as expected. Volume in the fourth quarter is expected to improve. However, shipping capacity remains tight and supply chains to China are stretched. 
So now we'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook on Slide 10. In Industrial Packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $70 million, mostly on the realization of our August 2021 price increase. That includes a negative mix impact as we start to recover some export backlogs. 
Volume is expected to improve by $65 million sequentially on strong seasonal demand even as we [ set down ] free shipping days. 
Operations and costs are expected to improve by $5 million, with the North American system benefiting from improved containerboard inventory levels, partly offset by onetime benefits in the third quarter. 
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $3 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $50 million, mostly on the flow-through of higher third quarter input costs for fiber and energy. 
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $25 million due to the non-repeat of onetime benefits in the third quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $37 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $15 million on higher wood and energy costs. 
On our outlook slide, we include the sequential earnings adjustment associated with the Printing Papers' spin and Kwidzyn sale for a total of $134 million across the 3 segments. 
With regard to cash flow, I would note that our cash from operations in the second half 2021 includes cash taxes of about $450 million associated with the various monetization transactions from earlier this year. Remember that the proceeds for these transactions are not captured in our free cash flow. However, the resulting cash taxes are included in free cash flow and the majority will be paid in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11, I'll take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the third quarter and what you can expect from International Paper following the recent paper spin.
We will maintain a strong balance sheet. As we previously said, we're comfortable taking our leverage below the stated target of 2.5x to 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million, which brings our year-to-date debt reduction to $1.1 billion. We will also complete an additional $800 million of debt repayment by the end of this month. 
Taking a look at pension, we are very pleased with the performance of our plan this year. Our qualified pension plan is fully funded, and we feel really good about the actions we've taken to improve performance and derisk the plan. 
Returning cash to shareowners is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the third quarter, we returned $411 million to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases were $212 million, which represented about 3.6 million shares at an average price of $59.13. 
Also earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which raises our total available authorizations to $3.3 billion. We will continue to execute on that authorization in a manner that maximizes value for shareowners over time. 
With regard to the dividend, our policy does not change. We are committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend, with a payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow. 
Earlier this month, we decreased our dividend by 9.8% to $1.85 per share annually, following the spin-off of the papers business. This adjustment is well below the 15% to 20% proportion of cash previously generated by the papers business as we outlined when we announced the spin last year. 
Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around $600 million, which is less than our original plan, primarily due to the timing of equipment delivery and a more challenging contract labor environment. We will continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pull back if circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build up capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth. 
We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging business in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must be compelling value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

Let's talk about the future and how we're going to accelerate value creation for IP and our shareholders. 
We are building a better IP. With the recent spin-off of the papers business, IP is really a corrugated packaging-focused company. We are significantly less complex with a much narrower geographic footprint. 
In addition, we have strengthened the company's financial footing, as Tim has described, significantly over the past few years. Our focused profile and financial strength will further enable us to make sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation. 
As I said earlier in the process, we've been actively working on multiple streams of earnings initiatives over the past year. We established a dedicated team that's been working closely with our businesses and external partners over the past year to identify, develop and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities which are now moving to scaled implementation. 
Let's turn to Slide 13 to see how our earnings drivers ramp up over the next few years. We will deliver $200 million to $225 million of gross incremental earnings in 2022. That represents more than 2x the dis-synergies resulting from the spin-off. Our value drivers ramp up in '23 and 2024, with net incremental earnings of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. These include around [indiscernible] in cost reduction initiatives and at least $50 million through commercial and investment initiatives. 
Our earnings catalysts are front-loaded, with significant benefits coming in 2022 from streamlining and simplifying the company and scaling a wide range of process optimization initiatives. 
Streamlining and simplifying is all about agility and effectiveness. The organization is being designed to support a packaging-focused company with a more focused footprint. We are aligning our talent to accelerate performance. 
We've also examined our processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. We are implementing and scaling new approaches for areas such as sourcing, supply chain and operations by leveraging technology and data analytics. Let me give you a few examples of these value drivers for 2022. 
We redesigned our sourcing process for our 200 converting facilities. 
We're using data analytics and third-party partners to deploy an automated catalog of sourcing options for operating and repair materials in our box plants. This program will deliver meaningful value in 2022. 
We're also using data analytics to unlock capacity in our converting facilities by improving our planning and order execution process. This includes, for example, how we aggregate and plan smaller orders and how we can optimize our manufacturing mix in each plant and each network of plants. 
We've also developed a new application to further optimize containerboard replenishment to our box plants. The system anticipates potential roll inventory stock-ups, which have been a big issue for us this year, and recommends the lowest-cost replenishment option to reduce premium freight. 
There are many initiatives that contribute to our value drivers and savings. We have really good line of sight on the expected benefits in 2022 and the ramp-up as we move forward. Our 2022 value drivers not only deliver meaningful benefits in the near term, they are also setting the foundation for IP going forward to accelerate commercial and investment excellence to drive profitable growth. 
So with that, we're ready to take your questions."

What we talked about in our second quarter is we thought it would take at least till the end of the year to get the inventory situation where it wasn't constrained.

What we talked about in our second quarter is we thought it would take at least till the end of the year to get the inventory situation where it wasn't constrained. I think we made a little more progress than we expected in the third quarter. And most importantly, September was a lot better than July. But we still have some spotty issues, depending on the grade and the type of end-use box. But we see, as we enter into the fourth quarter, with the progress we made in the third quarter, we should be getting close to our ability from a board supply to really track our own box shipments with the market. And we will continue to see EBITDA margin and absolute EBITDA improvement as we go forward. 
As you know and as we outlined and Tim talked about, we got it wrong on a number of our cost initiatives and our outlook for the third quarter. And that obviously took a bite out of our EBITDA margins. We really expected to be EBITDA margins in the 20-ish-plus percent in the third quarter, and we didn't get there primarily on the back of some costs that were, as I said, in some cases, twice as much as we thought they would be. Some of those costs on OCC are our own estimates about supply and demand and generation and where we're going to buy it from and what the transportation component is. And some of those costs are simply public information that I think all investors use, like the natural gas strip and things that are kind of publicly available. And in a big way, we sort of all got it wrong on that sense. 
But I'm encouraged that we're making progress. We're going to get the -- as we mentioned, the price flow-through is going well, and we're going to see our margins expand. And we're positioning the company to have no reason why we can't grow in box and in our other channels, which we've had a lot of success. A board that goes, whether it's to our equity partners or whether it's pure open market, and that goes into the U.S. box business as well. That overall 3-channel approach were doing quite well. Our own box plants have suffered primarily from the ability of us to get the right containerboard into the right plant at the right time.

And it's going to be our job not to let them get competed away. 
On the cellulose fibers question specifically, this is an ongoing story of improvement in the way the business operates, the way the business goes to market. And as I mentioned I think 2 quarters ago, we should expect a steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in the performance of the business. And we're seeing that. We're seeing that despite some of the unforeseen supply chain issues, which don't worry me so much strategically because I don't believe that will be a permanent state of port velocities and all of those kinds of things. So I think we will have a much better business commercially on the customer mix, the pricing strategies, the contract mechanisms. And as I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, that's a multiple quarter process. And I said we should see quarterly check-in points, like we're doing today, we should see continued improvement. And we had a really strong third quarter. And so I think we'll continue to see that. I think the supply chain will normalize. No one knows for sure when, maybe second half of next year, I don't know. But running of the business for the long term with the right customers and the right commercial arrangements will continue to produce long-term improvement in the business. 
And so the value drivers I outlined that are in the data analytics category, a lot of that has to do with International Paper-specific initiatives.

We've had to ramp up overtime and our employees have  accepted the challenge while we try to hire permanent employees, which has just been a real challenge in certain parts of the country. So that elevates -- a big portion of converting cost is labor, unlike in a mill system where the cost trend to be the input. And then transportation has been a real challenge.

And there's been this narrative from a lot of people in the industry that labor shortages and supply chain, all the things that we've been reading and hearing about, have not only increased cost, but also prevented converters integrated companies from hitting demand that they see ahead of them. And certainly, you pointed that in that slide. Would it be fair to say that, recognize there are going to be some apples and oranges in this, that the difference between the 1.7% box shipment trend that you saw in the third quarter relative to the channel growth that you saw, or I think you saw at 1.3%, was largely those constraints? And maybe that's putting too fine a point on it, but what do you think was the lost volume opportunity in boxes in the U.S. for you because of that? 
And the related question would be, how much of that lost sales, whatever the number, winds up being recaptured? And how much is permanently lost because some things that we're shipping boxes for right now, we're not going to be having Hanukkah and Christmas in February or March. So how would you have us think about those 2 questions?"

And in some cases, we just couldn't take the orders. But I will tell you, the majority of the business that we're not getting is new and incremental business. We're not ceding share in our existing customer base. So we're unable to always say yes to an order when a customer wants -- a new customer wants to give us additional business for the next few months or something, not a long-term contract. 
The biggest issue, July was very difficult. August was better, and we were much closer to the market in August. And in September, we were basically tracking with the market. So we improved through the quarter. And for us, it wasn't labor. Labor was a cost issue for us. For us, it was mostly the containerboard availability in the right box plant at the right time. 
So our inventory recovered nicely in the quarter, but the majority of that recovery occurred in the last month of the quarter. So the forgone sales really occurred in July and August, and it was hard to go -- we couldn't go back and get those. 
That's why I'm confident, even though it wasn't smooth through the quarter, we are entering the fourth quarter in a much healthier position. 
There are still, as I mentioned in my remarks, a few areas and a few segments that use a specific type of board that we might make at only 2 mills that we're still tight on. And depending on where demand is and how [indiscernible] trucks and trains are, we may end up in an issue. But we are in a much better position. 
So labor wasn't our demand or growth issue. Labor is a cost issue because we're asking people to work overtime to make more product. The board availability was our primary issue."

On the first question on cellulose fibers, the business is a value-creating enterprise for IP when the EBITDA margins are just north of 20%. And we had that in the third quarter, actually. We had value-creating returns. Now there were some oddities and one-offs. We've got a cost structure right now at the business no forest products business has ever seen and a supply chain coming up that no one's ever seen. I don't believe any of that will be permanent. And so thinking about the business strategically, at the current price levels, at the improving commercial arrangements where we're getting paid for the value we provide for our customers and a future cost structure that is a little more normalized, I think we're going to be a lot closer to and we will hit some quarters where it's a purely value-creating enterprise. And then the question is, how do you get it to be there permanent like we have our packaging business? And that's what we're working on. 
On the other investment question you asked, an example of some of the things we're working on that are not cost-related will be primarily, almost all of our near-term investments, will be in the converting system, aside from just normal protection of cash flow and your middle investments. 
But things like ideas that we have started to pilot and we've now done and it's working well, the wide range of customer segments we have. So e-commerce as a general, set of customers in a segment, is an entirely different set of demands in a plant than more general food uses, for example, in boxes. And having e-commerce only, small-focused facilities that are located, almost co-located with our customers, is an example of investments that we're beginning to develop. That will help us on the commercial side. It does 2 things. It puts the right assets for the right segments in place. And it keeps that business from detracting from the efficiency of the larger plant, which was never maybe built to do that type of packages at that kind of throughput. And so you immediately unlock capacity by making investment. A, you've essentially made investment; B, by just not running all that stuff in the current plants that is running it. And you'll see more of that as we go forward."

And whether -- how much of that is being impacted by supply chain or labor issues in the industry or perhaps with the customer. And particularly given the cost environment that we're in, people are just trying to figure out what can be next steps here to get to the types of margins. And so specific to sort of from a more overall industry perspective, is there a view you can share as to how much demand may have been temporarily depressed versus maybe there's just a more generic slowing going on in the business environment?"

Because people are probably going to operate on their prior patterns and they'll start to look at shopping, whether it's brick-and-mortar online in the November time period. I think there's going to potentially be a lot of disappointment. 
And so the anecdotal comment Tim made is customers have told us they could sell and ship more if they had more employees to run their factories. So they're working -- they're doing just what we're doing. They're working overtime. They're trying to hire people. But everybody is trying to hire the same people if you're in an industrial supply chain because it's semi to very skilled labor. And everybody is competing for the same people, and there aren't that many of them out there. So that will, at some point, I believe, correct itself because there's a ton of money, as you all know, pent-up in people and companies to buy things. And I don't think that, that pent-up demand is going to go anywhere. You're probably going to pass through a period of frustration where people can't get everything they want. You see that in a number of segments. But I think the demand driver is the money people have to spend and consume, and that's not going anywhere. And I think once we can all produce what the demand level is through the value chain, we'll see, I think, robust demand in the kinds of products that use corrugated for the foreseeable future."

We would expect to be pretty close to last year, so flattish on a year-over-year basis, which is on a pretty, as you know, Adam, a pretty tough comp. 
For us, the confidence in that $65 million of earnings improvement from volume that Tim talked about is primarily kind of, again, IP-specific. We are much better positioned with containerboard inventory going into this quarter so that we won't have to forgo some of the sales opportunities we just couldn't meet in the -- really, the second and the third quarter. So that's why we feel confident. Our -- again, our restriction was primarily our containerboard available. I mean, in theory, we could have pushed containerboard to our box plants by cutting off other customers that are just as profitable and just as strategic. Of course, we didn't do that, and we wouldn't do that. So now we have the ability to take these very high-value open market channels that have really been growing nicely and our own box business and not be as constrained as we have been by containerboard. 
Downstream from us and including us, the labor component that our customers are dealing with I think will begin to improve. I think the demand environment and the supply chain issues in the third quarter and the labor challenges, I think, surprised a lot of people in a lot of different value chains. And of course, they've been working on it. There's a lot of innovative approaches to hiring people right now. And that will produce some positive results, I believe, in the fourth quarter. And at least from what our customers are telling us about their expected demand and what they want us to prepare for, they're planning on solving some of their -- for them, mainly labor issues to have enough people to work to make the products they have demand for. So we think some of that will be getting better over the next few months."

And our customers, the ones we have and we don't speak for any of the industry, the ones we have are still pretty bullish on their fourth quarter and are asking us to prepare for levels of demand that are still very, very strong. 
On your first -- the first part of your question around supply chain, I think anybody who's transportation-heavy, like some of the food companies, are struggling with some of the same velocity issues that we're struggling with. Anybody who's taking in products from outside the U.S. and has to get through the ports are running into product availability. 
And then on the labor side, I think it's a smattering really everywhere. The competition is most heated in the more populated areas. So you might have a distribution center for an e-commerce player and a box plant from IP and 2 box plants from other people and another light manufacturing of some type all competing for skilled labor. 
If you're a food manufacturer in the middle of a rural area, your labor situation is probably more manageable. And that's what we see. Our labor situation primarily shows up in our box plants which are near cities and near a lot of labor competition. Our mills are more rural and they are in much better shape from a continuity of labor."

But if you go upstream in the value chain to where the containerboard is made, it's made near the forest, of course in most cases. And so it's just -- it's a less populated area. So labor availability and long-term labor loyalty to their employer is a lot higher."

Well, listen, you can tell from our conversation this morning, the questions and even our prepared remarks, it's really easy to live in this moment of craziness in the supply chain and really kind of dwell on it. But I'm personally confident that we'll continue to manage and overcome what we're dealing with today. We've got a tremendous team that's skilled in operating and they do a great job every day, every week, every month. 
We do expect, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and in some of the answers to the questions, that we expect our margins to recover further in the fourth quarter and we expect to be heading into 2022 with significant momentum.

In the third quarter, International Paper grew revenue, earnings and margins, and we continued to generate strong cash from operations. We continue to see strong demand for corrugated packaging and solid demand for absorbent pulp. We're making strong progress on price realization from our prior increases.  
Having said that, the supply chain and input cost environment remains very challenging and it impacted our results much more than we anticipated. The widespread supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full opportunity that comes with the strong level of demand that we're seeing.  
Our mills performed well. However, stretched supply chains impacted volume in our Industrial Packaging and Global Cellulose Fibers businesses.  
Containerboard inventories in our packaging network improved in the latter part of the third quarter, and we are in a much better position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Input costs in the third quarter rose by about $230 million or $0.46 per share, which was more than 2x what we had anticipated, with cost pressure in just about every category.  
Our Ilim joint venture delivered another strong performance, with equity earnings of $95 million. On capital allocation, we continue to make significant progress strengthening our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million.  
I would also highlight that our pension plan is fully funded. This is a significant milestone that further strengthens the company.  In the third quarter, we also returned $411 million to our shareholders, including $212 million of share repurchases.  
On October 1, we completed the spin-off of the Printing Papers business. IP received a $1.4 billion payment from Sylvamo, and we retained a 19.9% interest in the new company, which we intend to monetize within 1 year. The teams did an outstanding job executing the transaction in a very challenging environment. The Printing Papers business delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, and we wish Sylvamo all the best as they move forward as a stand-alone company.  
We are laser-focused on strengthening the company and building a better IP for all of our stakeholders. Tim and I will share more about the progress we're making during today's discussion.  
Turning now to Slide 4. We delivered EBITDA of $938 million and free cash flow of $519 million in the third quarter, which brings our free cash flow nearly $1.6 billion year-to-date.  Revenue increased by nearly $600 million or 12% when compared to last year. And if we exclude the Printing Papers business, third quarter revenue grew by 14% as compared to last year.  
We also expanded our margins in the third quarter with realization of our prior price increases. We expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter.  
I will now turn it over to Tim, who will cover our business performance and our fourth quarter outlook. Tim?"

Moving to the quarter-over-quarter earnings bridge on Slide 5, third quarter operating earnings per share were $1.35 as compared to $1.06 in the second quarter. Price and mix improved by $0.43 per share, with strong price realization across the 3 businesses. Volume decreased sequentially. Supply chain constraints limited our ability to capture the full benefit of a strong demand backdrop. We replenished our containerboard inventories in the latter part of the third quarter, which positions us well entering the seasonally strong fourth quarter.  
In our cellulose fibers business, demand for absorbent pulp is solid. Our pulp shipments were constrained due to significant port congestion and our backlogs remain stretched.  
Our mills performed well. Operating costs benefited by about $35 million of onetime items, including the sale of nitrogen credits and insurance recovery related to the winter storm earlier this year.  
Supply chains are stretched, and transportation costs are elevated for both inbound materials and outbound shipments. Every mode of transportation is tight, and we expect the transportation environment to remain tight for the foreseeable future.  
Maintenance costs decreased as expected. Input costs rose by $0.46 per share or about $230 million, which is more than double what we had anticipated for the quarter. Higher fiber and energy cost accounted for about 80% of this increase.  Corporate expenses were essentially flat.  
Tax expense was lower by $0.04 per share in the third quarter, with an effective tax rate of 18% as compared to 21% in the second quarter. Most of this was related to adjustments to our federal tax provision after finalizing our 2020 tax return in the third quarter.  Equity earnings were lower sequentially following the final monetization of our stake in GPK in the second quarter.  
Turning to the segments, I'll start with Industrial Packaging on Slide 6. We are seeing strong demand across all channels, including boxes, sheets and containerboard. Third quarter shipment across our U.S. channels improved by 1.3% year-over-year. However, box shipments were hampered by low containerboard inventories and stretched supply chains.  
We successfully replenished inventories across our box system in the latter part of the third quarter, which puts us in a much better inventory position as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter. We expect supply chains to remain stretched for the foreseeable future, which requires us to carry more inventory given the slower velocity across our network.  
To put the velocity into context, our mill-to-box plant containerboard supply chain is currently running 3 to 4 days longer than our normalized flow, and in some lanes, even longer.  
Taking a look at third quarter performance. Price and mix was strong. Our March increase is essentially fully implemented, with $128 million of price realization in the third quarter. Volume was lower by $45 million. Box shipments in North America were impacted by low containerboard inventory, especially in the first half of the quarter. Volume in EMEA was seasonally slower, as expected, representing about $10 million of the sequential decrease. Operations and costs were essentially flat sequentially. Our mill system performed at 100% and provided much needed inventory relief to our box system. In the third quarter, we also received insurance proceeds of about $15 million related to the winter storm. These benefits were largely offset by unplanned maintenance costs.  
We are not seeing any relief on supply chain costs and are managing risk associated with transportation capacity and congestion across the rail and truck networks.  
Input costs increased by nearly $190 million in the quarter. OCC and wood fiber accounted for $120 million of that total. Energy accounted for another $45 million, primarily in our recycled containerboard mills and our box plants.  
Taking a closer look at fiber, our North American packaging fiber mix is around 65% virgin wood and 35% OCC. Wood fiber costs rose sharply in the third quarter due to continued wet conditions across the Southern and Eastern regions as well as inbound transportation constraints. Wood inventories are below our control limits, and we expect difficult operating conditions again in the fourth quarter.  
We expect demand for OCC to remain strong, with no cost relief even as generation gradually improves. As a reminder, we consume about 4.5 million tons annually in the U.S. and nearly 0.5 million tons in EMEA.  
Moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on Slide 7. The business delivered earnings of $96 million. Third quarter segment earnings included $13 million from the Sylvamo subsidiary and the Kwidzyn mill, which are no longer part of our operations in the fourth quarter.  
Looking at our sequential earnings, price and mix improved by $59 million. Volume improved by $11 million sequentially. Demand for fluff pulp, which represents about 75 of our -- 75% of our mix remained solid.  
Our shipments continue to be negatively impacted by unprecedented port congestion and vessel delays. Keep in mind that we export about 90% of our volume in this business. The majority of this is fluff pulp that ships in containers which is where port congestion is especially challenging. We have systems in place to manage through this environment. However, vessel delays and higher supply chain costs are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  
Our mills performed well. We also benefited from about $20 million of onetime items related to the sale of nitrogen credits and lower corporate costs in the quarter. These benefits were largely offset by $50 million of higher supply chain costs for export operations.  
Maintenance outage costs decreased sequentially, while input costs were a significant headwind in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher wood and chemical costs.  
Turning to Printing Papers on Slide 8. The business delivered earnings of $106 million in the third quarter, with strong momentum ahead of the spinoff. Third quarter results includes the Kwidzyn mill until the sale on August 6. Performance in the third quarter was strong with continued demand recovery globally and price realization outpacing rising input costs.  
Now that the spin-off is complete, the historical results of the business will be treated as a discontinued operation with a full recast of previous periods. And going forward, activity pertaining to the Printing Papers offtake agreement for Riverdale and Georgetown will be included in our Packaging and Global Cellulose Fiber segment earnings.  
I do want to echo Mark's sentiment and thank our teams for successfully executing the spin in a very challenging environment.  
Looking to the Ilim results on Slide 9. The joint venture delivered another quarter of strong performance with equity earnings of $95 million and an EBITDA margin of 44%. Solid price realization for pulp and containerboard were partially offset by lower volume due to high planned maintenance outages in the quarter as expected. Volume in the fourth quarter is expected to improve. However, shipping capacity remains tight and supply chains to China are stretched.  
So now we'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook on Slide 10. In Industrial Packaging, we expect price and mix to improve by $70 million, mostly on the realization of our August 2021 price increase. That includes a negative mix impact as we start to recover some export backlogs.  Volume is expected to improve by $65 million sequentially on strong seasonal demand even as we cut down free shipping days.  
Operations and costs are expected to improve by $5 million, with the North American system benefiting from improved containerboard inventory levels, partly offset by onetime benefits in the third quarter.  
Staying with Industrial Packaging, maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $3 million. Input costs are expected to increase by $50 million, mostly on the flow-through of higher third quarter input costs for fiber and energy.  
In Global Cellulose Fibers, we expect price and mix to be stable. Volume is expected to decrease by $5 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $25 million due to the non-repeat of onetime benefits in the third quarter. Maintenance outage expense is expected to increase by $37 million. And input costs are expected to increase by $15 million on higher wood and energy costs.  
On our outlook slide, we include the sequential earnings adjustment associated with the Printing Papers' spin and Kwidzyn sale for a total of $134 million across the 3 segments.  
With regard to cash flow, I would note that our cash from operations in the second half 2021 includes cash taxes of about $450 million associated with the various monetization transactions from earlier this year. Remember that the proceeds for these transactions are not captured in our free cash flow. However, the resulting cash taxes are included in free cash flow and the majority will be paid in the fourth quarter.  
Turning to Slide 11, I'll take a moment to update you on our capital allocation actions in the third quarter and what you can expect from International Paper following the recent paper spin. 
We will maintain a strong balance sheet. As we previously said, we're comfortable taking our leverage below the stated target of 2.5x to 2.8x debt-to-EBITDA on a Moody's basis. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by $235 million, which brings our year-to-date debt reduction to $1.1 billion. We will also complete an additional $800 million of debt repayment by the end of this month.  
Taking a look at pension, we are very pleased with the performance of our plan this year. Our qualified pension plan is fully funded, and we feel really good about the actions we've taken to improve performance and derisk the plan.  
Returning cash to share owners is a meaningful part of our capital allocation framework. In the third quarter, we returned $411 million to share owners through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases were $212 million, which represented about 3.6 million shares at an average price of $59.13.  
Also earlier this month, the Board of Directors approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase program, which raises our total available authorizations to $3.3 billion. We will continue to execute on that authorization in a manner that maximizes value for share owners over time.  
With regard to the dividend, our policy does not change. We are committed to a competitive and sustainable dividend, with a payout of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, which we will continue to review annually as earnings and cash flow grow.  
Earlier this month, we decreased our dividend by 9.8% to $1.85 per share annually, following the spin-off of the papers business. This adjustment is well below the 15% to 20% proportion of cash previously generated by the papers business as we outlined when we announced the spin last year.  
Investment excellence is essential to growing earnings and cash generation. We expect CapEx in 2021 to be around $600 million, which is less than our original plan, primarily due to the timing of equipment delivery and a more challenging contract labor environment. We will continue to proactively manage CapEx and have the ability to increase or pull back if circumstances warrant. You can expect strategic capital to be deployed mostly to our packaging business to build up capability and capacity needs to drive profitable growth.  
We will continue to assess disciplined and selective M&A opportunities to supplement our goal of accelerating profitable growth. You can expect M&A to focus primarily on bolt-on opportunities in our packaging business in North America and Europe. Any potential opportunity we pursue must be compelling value for our shareholders.  
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mark."

Let's talk about the future and how we're going to accelerate value creation for IP and our shareholders.  
We are building a better IP. With the recent spin-off of the papers business, IP is really a corrugated packaging-focused company. We are significantly less complex with a much narrower geographic footprint.  
In addition, we have strengthened the company's financial footing, as Tim has described, significantly over the past few years. Our focused profile and financial strength will further enable us to make sustainable, profitable growth and accelerate value creation.  
As I said earlier in the process, we've been actively working on multiple streams of earnings initiatives over the past year. We established a dedicated team that's been working closely with our businesses and external partners over the past year to identify, develop and pilot a wide range of highly attractive opportunities which are now moving to scaled implementation.  
Let's turn to Slide 13 to see how our earnings drivers ramp up over the next few years. We will deliver $200 million to $225 million of gross incremental earnings in 2022. That represents more than 2x the dis-synergies resulting from the spin-off. Our value drivers ramp up in '23 and 2024, with net incremental earnings of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. These include around $300 million in cost reduction initiatives and at least $50 million through commercial and investment initiatives.  
Our earnings catalysts are front-loaded, with significant benefits coming in 2022 from streamlining and simplifying the company and scaling a wide range of process optimization initiatives.  
Streamlining and simplifying is all about agility and effectiveness. The organization is being designed to support a packaging-focused company with a more focused footprint. We are aligning our talent to accelerate performance.  
We've also examined our processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs. We are implementing and scaling new approaches for areas such as sourcing, supply chain and operations by leveraging technology and data analytics. Let me give you a few examples of these value drivers for 2022.  
We redesigned our sourcing process for our 200 converting facilities. We're using data analytics and third-party partners to deploy an automated catalog of sourcing options for operating and repair materials in our box plants. This program will deliver meaningful value in 2022.  
We're also using data analytics to unlock capacity in our converting facilities by improving our planning and order execution process. This includes, for example, how we aggregate and plan smaller orders and how we can optimize our manufacturing mix in each plant and each network of plants.  
We've also developed a new application to further optimize containerboard replenishment to our box plants. The system anticipates potential roll inventory stock-ups, which have been a big issue for us this year, and recommends the lowest-cost replenishment option to reduce premium freight.  
There are many initiatives that contribute to our value drivers and the savings. We have really good line of sight on the expected benefits in 2022 and the ramp-up as we move forward. Our 2022 value drivers not only deliver meaningful benefits in the near term, they are also setting the foundation for IP going forward to accelerate commercial and investment excellence to drive profitable growth.  
So with that, we're ready to take your questions."

What we talked about in our second quarter is we thought it would take at least till the end of the year to get the inventory situation where it wasn't constrained.

What we talked about in our second quarter is we thought it would take at least till the end of the year to get the inventory situation where it wasn't constrained. I think we made a little more progress than we expected in the third quarter. And most importantly, September was a lot better than July. But we still have some spotty issues, depending on the grade and the type of end-use box. But we see, as we enter into the fourth quarter, with the progress we made in the third quarter, we should be getting close to our ability from a board supply to really track our own box shipments with the market. And we will continue to see EBITDA margin and absolute EBITDA improvement as we go forward. 
As you know and as we outlined and Tim talked about, we got it wrong on a number of our cost initiatives and our outlook for the third quarter. And that obviously took a bite out of our EBITDA margins. We really expected to be EBITDA margins in the 20-ish-plus percent in the third quarter, and we didn't get there primarily on the back of some costs that were, as I said, in some cases, twice as much as we thought they would be. Some of those costs on OCC are our own estimates about supply and demand and generation and where we're going to buy it from and what the transportation component is. And some of those costs are simply public information that I think all investors use, like the natural gas strip and things that are kind of publicly available. And in a big way, we sort of all got it wrong on that sense. 
But I'm encouraged that we're making progress. We're going to get the -- as we mentioned, the price flow-through is going well, and we're going to see our margins expand. And we're positioning the company to have no reason why we can't grow in box and in our other channels, which we've had a lot of success. A board that goes, whether it's to our equity partners or whether it's pure open market, and that goes into the U.S. box business as well, that overall 3-channel approach were doing quite well. Our own box plants have suffered primarily from the ability of us to get the right containerboard into the right plant at the right time. They show up 2 weeks late and the order had to be made 2 weeks earlier. So that's in a lot better shape, and I feel good about that right now."

On the cellulose fibers question specifically, this is an ongoing story of improvement in the way the business operates, the way the business goes to market. And as I mentioned I think 2 quarters ago, we should expect a steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in the performance of the business. And we're seeing that. And we're seeing that despite some of the unforeseen supply chain issues, which don't worry me so much strategically because I don't believe that will be a permanent state of port velocities and all of those kinds of things. 
So I think we will have a much better business commercially on the customer mix, the pricing strategies, the contract mechanisms. And as I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, that's a multiple quarter process. And I said we should see quarterly check-in points, like we're doing today, and we should see continued improvement. And we had a really strong third quarter. And so I think we'll continue to see that. I think the supply chain will normalize. 
No one knows for sure when, maybe second half of next year, I don't know. But the running of the business for the long term with the right customers and the right commercial arrangements will continue to produce long-term improvement in the business. 
And so the value drivers I outlined that are in the data analytics category, a lot of that has to do with International Paper-specific initiatives.

In some cases, we had plants that were designed pre-pandemic to run 5 days a week, which is not uncommon in the box industry. Some were 24/7, but not a lot of them. We've had to ramp up overtime and our employees have accepted the challenge while we try to hire permanent employees, which has just been a real challenge in certain parts of the country. So that elevates -- a big portion of converting cost is labor, unlike in a mill system where the costs trend to be the input. And then transportation has been a real challenge. And again, some of it's regional, but I think those -- the cost increases on the labor side, whether it's overtime or new employees, is still the right thing to do because it allows us to get more revenue and more sales."

And there's been this narrative from a lot of people in the industry that labor shortages and supply chain, all the things that we've been reading and hearing about, have not only increased cost, but also prevented converters integrated companies from hitting demand that they see ahead of them. And certainly, you pointed that in that slide. Would it be fair to say that, recognize there are going to be some apples and oranges in this, that the difference between the 1.7% box shipment trend that you saw in the third quarter relative to the channel growth that you saw or think you saw at 1.3%, was largely those constraints? And maybe that's putting too fine a point on it, but what do you think was the lost volume opportunity in boxes in the U.S. for you because of that? 
And the related question would be, how much of that lost sales, whatever the number, winds up being recaptured? And how much is permanently lost because some things that we're shipping boxes for right now, we're not going to be having Hanukkah and Christmas in February or March. So how would you have us think about those 2 questions?"

July, we still had more containerboard shortages in different parts of the box system and we had a heavy order intake. And in some cases, we just couldn't take the orders. But I will tell you, the majority of the business that we're not getting is new and incremental business. We're not ceding share in our existing customer base. So we're unable to always say yes to an order when a customer wants -- a new customer wants to give us additional business for the next few months or something, not a long-term contract. 
The biggest issue, July was very difficult. August was better, and we were much closer to the market in August. And in September, we were basically tracking with the market. So we improved through the quarter. And for us, it wasn't labor. Labor was a cost issue for us. For us, it was mostly the containerboard availability in the right box plant at the right time. 
So our inventory recovered nicely in the quarter, but the majority of that recovery occurred in the last month of the quarter. So the forgone sales really occurred in July and August, and it was hard to go -- we couldn't go back and get those. 
That's why I'm confident, even though it wasn't smooth through the quarter, we are entering the fourth quarter in a much healthier position. 
There are still, as I mentioned in my remarks, a few areas and a few segments that use a specific type of board that we might make at only 2 mills that we're still tight on. And depending on where demand is and how slow trucks and trains are, we may end up in an issue. But we are in a much better position. 
So labor wasn't our demand or growth issue. Labor is a cost issue because we're asking people to work overtime to make more product. The board availability was our primary issue."

So as regards pulp, and we covered this a lot on these calls, we and the other -- and our colleague analysts, yes, you saw improvement in the third quarter. But if we do the waterfall into the fourth quarter, we're back to relatively low EBIT levels for Global Cellulose Fibers. Yes, fluff is less volatile, but we're seeing obviously commodity paper-grade prices dropping pretty sharply. And so can you remind us, what ultimately you would like to see, what you think would be a fair EBITDA return for the business for it to be a value creator within the IP portfolio? 
And then my other question, you're obviously doing some tremendous things to improve costs and improve value within the company, the spin of Sylvamo, the cost reduction and commercial initiatives. I think you mentioned at least a couple of times on this call today, and we've heard it throughout earnings season already, these are unprecedented times in terms of cost and supply chain inflation. What other things might you be contemplating away from cost, but on the commercial side, that might be reflective of a new paradigm in how IP might need to address these challenges to improve return and value for its shareholders going forward?"

On the first question on cellulose fibers, the business is a value-creating enterprise for IP when the EBITDA margins are just north of 20%. And we had that in the third quarter, actually. We had value-creating returns. Now there were some oddities and one-offs. We've got a cost structure right now that the business any -- no forest products business has ever seen and a supply chain coming up that no one's ever seen. I don't believe any of that will be permanent. And so thinking about the business strategically, at the current price levels, at the improving commercial arrangements where we're getting paid for the value we provide for our customers and a future cost structure that is a little more normalized, I think we're going to be a lot closer to and we will hit some quarters where it's a purely value-creating enterprise. And then the question is, how do you get it to be there permanent like we have our packaging business? And that's what we're working on. 
On the other investment question you asked, an example of some of the things we're working on that are not cost-related will be primarily, almost all of our near-term investments will be in the converting system, aside from just normal protection of cash flow and your mill investments. 
But things like ideas that we have started to pilot and we've now done and it's working well, the wide range of customer segments we have. So e-commerce, as a general set of customers in a segment, is an entirely different set of demands in a plant than more general food uses, for example, in boxes. And having e-commerce only, small focused facilities that are located, almost co-located with our customers, is an example of investments that we're beginning to develop. That will help us on the commercial side. It does 2 things. It puts the right assets for the right segments in place. And it keeps that business from detracting from the efficiency of the larger plant, which was never maybe built to do that type of packages at that kind of throughput. And so you immediately unlock capacity by making investment. A, you've essentially made investment; B, by just not running all that stuff in the current plants that is running it. And you'll see more of that as we go forward."

Because people are probably going to operate on their prior patterns and they'll start to look at shopping, whether it's brick-and-mortar, online in the November time period. I think there's going to potentially be a lot of disappointment. 
And so the anecdotal comment Tim made is customers have told us they could sell and ship more if they had more employees to run their factories. So they're working -- they're doing just what we're doing. They're working overtime. They're trying to hire people. But everybody is trying to hire the same people if you're in an industrial supply chain because it's semi to very skilled labor. 
And everybody is competing for the same people, and there aren't that many of them out there. So that will, at some point, I believe, correct itself because there's a ton of money, as you all know, pent-up in people and companies to buy things. And I don't think that, that pent-up demand is going to go anywhere. You're probably going to pass through a period of frustration where people can't get everything they want. You see that in a number of segments. 
But I think the demand driver is the money people have to spend and consume, and that's not going anywhere. And I think once we can all produce what the demand level is through the value chain, we'll see, I think, robust demand in the kinds of products that use corrugated for the foreseeable future."

So the key message was returning cash to share owners is an important part of our capital allocation and we do it partly through dividend and partly through share repurchases. And we felt like we had latitude to reduce the dividend by a smaller amount than what we originally pointed to."

Is it reasonable to expect embedded in your volume guidance, 3Q to 4Q, if I think $65 million of growth in Industrial Packaging, are you expecting to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter or flattish? Or can you just give us any sense of what you think you're going to do or the industry might do relative to the third quarter, which was obviously unexpectedly flat because of some of the issues you flagged?"

We would expect it to be pretty close to last year, so flattish on a year-over-year basis, which is on a pretty, as you know, Adam, a pretty tough comp. 
For us, the confidence in that $65 million of earnings improvement from volume that Tim talked about is primarily kind of, again, IP-specific. We are much better positioned with containerboard inventory going into this quarter so that we won't have to forgo some of the sales opportunities we just couldn't meet in the -- really, the second and the third quarter. So that's why we feel confident. Our -- again, our restriction was primarily our containerboard available. I mean, in theory, we could have pushed containerboard to our box plants by cutting off other customers that are just as profitable and just as strategic. Of course, we didn't do that, and we wouldn't do that. So now we have the ability to take these very high-value open market channels that have really been growing nicely and our own box business and not be as constrained as we have been by containerboard. 
Downstream from us and including us, the labor component that our customers are dealing with I think will begin to improve. I think the demand environment and the supply chain issues in the third quarter and the labor challenges, I think, surprised a lot of people in a lot of different value chains. And of course, they've been working on it. There's a lot of innovative approaches to hiring people right now. And that will produce some positive results, I believe, in the fourth quarter. And at least from what our customers are telling us about their expected demand and what they want us to prepare for, they're planning on solving some of their -- for them, mainly labor issues to have enough people to work to make the products they have demand for. So we think some of that will be getting better over the next few months."

And our customers, the ones we have and we don't speak for any of the industry, the ones we have are still pretty bullish on their fourth quarter and are asking us to prepare for levels of demand that are still very, very strong. 
On your first -- the first part of your question around supply chain, I think anybody who's transportation-heavy, like some of the food companies, are struggling with some of the same velocity issues that we're struggling with. Anybody who's taking in products from outside the U.S. and has to get through the ports are running into product availability. 
And then on the labor side, I think it's a smattering really everywhere. The competition is most heated in the more populated areas. So you might have a distribution center for an e-commerce player and a box plant from IP and 2 box plants from other people and another light manufacturing of some type all competing for skilled labor. 
If you're a food manufacturer in the middle of a rural area, your labor situation is probably more manageable. And that's what we see. Our labor situation primarily shows up in our box plants which are near cities and near a lot of labor competition. Our mills are more rural and they are in much better shape from a continuity of labor."

So you sort of -- it's a theoretical statement to say, ""I wish my box plants were away from cities."" Most of the manufactured products are near population centers on the box side. But if you go upstream in the value chain to where the containerboard is made, it's made near the forest, of course, in most cases. And so it's just -- it's a less populated area. So labor availability and long-term labor loyalty to their employer is a lot higher."

And then you have the kind of unprecedented natural gas cost issues in Europe. And it will take a little bit of time for product pricing to kind of catch up with that. So it was more of a timing quarter issue than a structural issue. 
Well, listen, you can tell from our conversation this morning, the questions and even our prepared remarks, it's really easy to live in this moment of craziness in the supply chain and really kind of dwell on it. But I'm personally confident that we'll continue to manage and overcome what we're dealing with today. We've got a tremendous team that's skilled in operating and they do a great job every day, every week, every month. 
We do expect, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and in some of the answers to the questions, that we expect our margins to recover further in the fourth quarter and we expect to be heading into 2022 with significant momentum. 
I'm equally confident and very optimistic about our future. We just showed you 2 slides today on some of the value drivers. We have a lot more to share with you as we go forward. We have the right plan, the right people to deliver on our commitments to build a better IP. 
Tim took you through our capital allocation framework. I'll say it again, we haven't been in this position on cash generation and cash return ability in almost forever. And we're excited about building a good portion of our total shareholder return on return of cash to shareholders, dividend, share repurchase. And then value drivers and the focused IP delivers the other half, which is going to come with the profitable growth that we have in our sites. 
So thank you for your interest in International Paper. We really look forward to speaking with you again in the future."
