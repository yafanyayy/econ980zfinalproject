We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19, and we recognized our first annual loss since 197",751,"Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19, and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry. 
We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion, including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our [indiscernible] program. We have the strongest balance sheet, and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt. 
Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability, and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that, in turn, has resulted in unprecedented job security, especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic. And I'm very, very proud of that. 
We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances, it was released this week, with Southwest as #1. 
And finally, we have the best customer service, and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that once again, we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of fewest customer complaints. 
Now no one can deny that, that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me, as I was recapping that, I was listening to Herb many years ago, he pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category, much less 5. And I mentioned these things really not to brag, but just to put things in perspective. And that is to say that yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our startup year. But we have much to be grateful for, and we have every reason to be hopeful that this, too, shall pass. And when it does, we will be ready. 
And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven and then beyond that, prosperity. So there's a balancing act here, and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic, and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key And we're intensely focused on that. 
And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience, and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February, winter doldrum, we'll see what happens, and we'll respond accordingly. 
So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder, except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for. And we do, and especially at Southwest. And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again. I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could would join me and say how proud we are of them, and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes. 
So some of these heroes are sitting here with me. And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO."
31726,694554492,2184386,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Well, thanks, Gary, and I'd be happy to. As Gary was mentioning, in terms of our operations, the fourth quarter was exceptional. We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed gover",966,"Well, thanks, Gary, and I'd be happy to. As Gary was mentioning, in terms of our operations, the fourth quarter was exceptional. We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed government support, and that allowed us to pivot away from those time-consuming discussions about furloughs and concessions and jobs security. 
We were able to grow our city portfolio and the vaccine rollout began. And beneath all of those things, Southwest produced our overall best quarterly operational performance in our history. 
And as Gary mentioned, I too have just -- I'm very proud and very grateful to our people. There's tremendous activity associated with all those items I just mentioned. And in addition to those things, though, our people still go to work every day. and deal with day-to-day issues of a pandemic environment, and yet they never lose their focus on our customers, on our company or each other. And they are just a great team. So for the fourth quarter, our on-time performance of 93% was industry-leading and the best in our history. We finished the year at 86%, and that was the best since 2003. 
Our baggage handling was equally as impressive with just over 2 bags per 1,000 carried being damaged or mishandled . So if you flip that around, that's about a 99.8% accuracy rate. And again, the best in our history and in the top tier in the industry. 
That reliability, coupled with our hospitality, produced Net Promoter Scores in the mid-70s for the fourth quarter and for the year. So again, the best performance in our history. And we do expect to lead the industry once more with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio when those are published. 
So the capital off, we finished 2020 with the best overall operational performance of any U.S. airline as measured by the Wall Street Journal's middle fleet scorecard. So as I said before, just a great team. 
Our fleet has been a particular focus as of late. We now have a combination of additional aircraft available to us from the MAX return to service as well as a lower demand environment from this pandemic. And that gives our tech ops department several options to optimize our maintenance costs by storing some of our older aircraft and replacing any necessary flying with our most efficient aircraft, MAX. The MAX is more reliable. It has a lower fuel burn. It's quieter. It's less expensive to maintain, and it's our most comfortable aircraft from a customer perspective. And it is a key component of our future. 
So we took delivery of 7 leased MAXes from Boeing in December. And if you combine that with the 34 MAXes we had in storage in Victorville, that brought our MAX fleet to 41 aircraft by year-end. We also identified 20 of our older 737-700 that had an expensive near-term maintenance profile, and we accelerated their retirement at the year-end, and that brought our fleet total down to 718 aircraft for use in the operation as we go into 2021. 
There are 60 NGs included in that year-end fleet count in a long-term storage program. And so the rest of the airplanes, they rotate through our operation and our short-term parking program or they're in heavy maintenance visits. And that approach gives us tremendous near-term flexibility to either slow down or accelerate flight activity as demand dictates. 
So March 11 is when the MAX returns to revenue flying. All of our pilots will have been trained. We will have over 200 validation or readiness flight tests completed. And we'll be starting out in a very small and focused manner for the first month with just 10 lines of flying. They'll be isolated to all MAX lines. We will not co-mingle the NG and the MAX fleet for that first month of service. After that, we'll have roughly 65 MAX aircraft available for service, and we expect to be in normal operational mode by mid-April. We'll end 2021 with 69 MAX aircraft. 
In closing with the fleet, we plan on running similar requirement analysis to optimize maintenance costs in 2021, just like we did in 2020. And we don't expect our fleet to grow in 2021 as compared to the 747 aircraft at year-end 2019. We do continue to evaluate our longer-term fleet needs, and we are in discussions with Boeing as to our order book beyond 2021. As we do start this new year, we do have our eye on a couple of other critical operational areas. First, we are initiating operations in 8 new locations by June 6. There's quite a bit of coordination and facility build-out, staffing equipment and security-related actions that go into opening up a new location. And Gary, I think 8 between now and early June, is another all-time Southwest record, and that is a very impressive team. 
Second, we are in a very reactive environment with respect to COVID restrictions. There are new international requirements with testing and attestation protocols. They're evolving domestic requirements, and there are various mask-related challenges that our teams are reacting to every day. 
So it does take a special team to be able to deliver record-breaking operating results, manage a complicated fleet environment, bringing the MAX back into service and optimizing retirements of older airplanes to open up 8 new locations in 4 months and just to adjust on the fly to constantly changing COVID requirements. 
And I think about our people, and they make all of that look so easy, and I do it every day. And as I said, they're just a special team, and I'm really proud to be a part of it. 
And I think with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you."

And I also we want to start by thanking all of our frontline employees. What a year, what results and really proud of what we've accomplished in the team. .
On prior calls, I've always to recognizing our commercial teams, our network planning, revenue management, the marketing folks, Southwest business, the customer relations team and [indiscernible]. And what they're doing is absolutely incredible. But I also do want to recognize a few teams there is always in that ground that if they aren't there, if nothing else happens, our technology teams, our finance teams, our strategy team and so many others. So they've done incredible work over the past year, honestly, that I cannot even imagine or envision. So thanks so much for what you're doing. 
So I do want to provide a quick recap of our fourth quarter revenue performance. And then I'll cover our near-term trends and guidance for the first quarter. So our fourth quarter operating revenue was [down ]  65% year-over-year, which is a modest sequential improvement compared with 68% decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Fourth quarter passengers declined 64% year-over-year, and our average fares were down 14%, which is a favorable comp being down 20% in the third quarter. We did see some pockets of sequential yield in premium, which was encouraging. 
Our fourth quarter load factor was 54%, which is up from 45% in the third quarter. And this was driven primarily by a boost in the December load factor at 60%. And as you all know, at our CCAP on December 1. And this is all on the fourth quarter capacity to get 21% year-over-year. with a few monthly performance highlights, if you will. October leisure demand and bookings held up well compare September and that's despite September benefiting from Labor Day holiday travel. October operating revenues were down 64% with a load factor of 55%, capacity down 44% at all on a year-over-year basis. So given the environment, that was a pretty encouraging result for October. 
November, though, we did begin to see exploring revenue trends. We expected to see that, that will coincide with the presidential elections, but we never got back on to our pre-election fronts, which in hindsight, I suppose, is surprising given the COVID cases and hospitalizations around the rise, along with new quarantine requirements, travel restrictions, government orders, et cetera, et cetera, and all the primary management, and all these are the primary drivers of the softness in demand. 
And coincident, we also saw an increase in trip cancellations in the weeks we have [indiscernible]. Relative to the rest of the month, this demand was more resilient to the Thanksgiving travel period. Even with the worsening pandemic background, November operating revenues went to 1 to 2 points year-over-year due to the holiday timing shift from 2019. So November finished with operating revenues down 63% with a load factor of 48% and capacity down 35%, again all on a year-over-year comp basis. December had many of the same challenges we saw in November with a continued surge in COVID cases, a softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings and elevated trip cancellations. And similar, Thanksgiving leisure demand for December holiday travel outpace nonholiday time periods, and the summer leisure revenue trends were supported by some pockets of strength. 
Operating revenues for December were down 67% year-over-year with a load factor of 60, both of which were in line with our guidance, and that was on capacity that was down 43% year-over-year. And just as a reminder, the holiday shift in 2019 had a negative impact of 6 to 7 points year-over-year for December. 
See, regarding middle seats, we estimate an operating income penalty of $30 million in October and a $10 million penalty in November. So really no surprise there. And as you know, and as I referenced, we opened up all seats for availability beginning December 1. So for December, we estimate a revenue boost of around $80 million as a result of selling all seats. 
Our December load factor was up 12 points versus November. And our yields were down month-over-month. But if you adjust for the year-over-year calendar impact of holidays, December's year-over-year revenues improved 4 points sequentially as compared to November. And again, this was very much in line with we expecting. 
In terms of the demand environment, it clearly continues to be heavily leisure oriented. Business demand continues to be very weak, and our corporate managed travel. It was down 87% in the fourth quarter. which was actually a slight improvement in the third quarter, but no real movement to speak of. And we expect business travel to down -- to remain down significantly this year, and I don't think that's surprising to anybody. As you know, January and February are typically heavy business travel months, but the absence of business travel is making a weaker leisure travel period even more challenging, and I'll talk about that just for a few minutes here. 
I do want to hit on very quickly a few highlights of our other revenue, which was down 18% year-over-year, which is obviously much less than the decline we experienced in passenger revenues. And as you expect, the products like early boarding, upgraded boarding, revenue has trended almost right in line with the passenger decline that we're seeing. However, we've seen a much stronger revenue performance for our app rewards program. Revenue from our Rapid Rewards program is down 38% year-over-year, which, again, is a solid improvement from a decrease of 43% in the third quarter. And aside from that, for part redemptions rather for travel, our loyalty program continues to perform very, very well. Our credit card portfolio is a real point of strength for us, I think, a differentiator, and we're continuing to see strong performance from our children credit cards, which reinforces what I've said many times, which is that our cards really are top of water customers for everyday purchases as well as for air travel. 
In fact, revenue from car spend in the fourth quarter performed well and was down only 11% year-over-year. We're also continuing to acquire new Rapid Rewards members and new cardholders, although at a slower rate, simply because there are fewer people traveling. So in spite of the environment, the size of our program is essentially unchanged, which I think is a pretty powerful statement in the environment. 
You may have seen we recently provided all Rapid Rewards members with a boost. They're qualifying points towards A-List to Ali preferred and companion fast status. And these, as you know, are very most or customers, and we value them menses and they value us and they certainly value their tier status. So to close out Q4, I just -- I do want to hit on a few things that Gary and Mike referenced, and that's our brand NPS score as well as our DOT customer set rankings. Both were the best scores in the industry, and we are very proud of that. But I will tell you that we don't take ever granted, we work really hard to get those results. And our people worked really hard to get those results, specifically to the DOT customer set score, where we had a ratio of 2.91 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded, which is far, far ahead of our competition. And it's just an incredible result. And again, it comes down to our people to have the talent to our customer service to our culture what we believe in. 
So I just want to say thanks all pose for that. That's it for the fourth quarter, we'll move into Q1. Well, at this point, we are nearly done with January and demand has remained as you keep saying, stall. We expect January operating revenues to decrease 65% to [70%  ] with a load factor of 50% to 55%, with ASMs being down 41%. And again, that's on a year-over-year basis. And this compares slightly favorably to our mid-December guidance ranges for both revenue and load factor. And January demand has held pretty steady over the past month or so. And I think in this environment, steady, honestly, and it's so bad. So I'll take that right now. In February, we expect a fairly similar revenue performance in January, but January did benefit from stronger holiday return travel during the first month of the month. We really don't see a real catalyst for February demand at this point. And as you know, this is historically a low month for leisure travel. And the business trial that normally fill in the demand is simply isn't showing up. We currently expect February operating revenues to decrease 65% to 75% year-over-year, with a load factor of 50% to 55% and capacity at 46% year-over-year -- down 46% year-over-year. 
And at this point, we aren't providing March revenue guidance, but we'll be certainly providing an 8-K in mid-February, and we'll cover all that. But I did think it's worth sharing a few thoughts about what we're seeing beyond February at this point in time. So it is still pretty early in our booking curve for March and April -- April, but relative to January and February, we are seeing a slight uptick in bookings for 12 months. We're behind in the booking curve. We've said that previously. versus what we've normally been. But given such the situation, I don't think that's a surprise. I think that's to be expected. You likely saw that we've had more promotional activity than usual, including a recent air sale that included in the March and April travel period. That's unusual for us. In fact, we're talking about this other day, and I don't think any of us could recall was doing a while sale in January. But that's where we are and the goal is simple. We need to stimulate travel. We need to get more bookings in place. I'd say the sales performed pretty much in line with our expectations. But for now, we're not seeing a material boost in bookings from March. But having said that, we are continuing to build both factors every week, and the booking curve continues to be skewed close in, so we do expect bookings to continue to fill in. What's not clear though is to what degree. We could be surprised to the upside, but at this point, there's no real clear revenues on that quite yet. 
We've shared this with you all before, but once we get back to operating revenues, they're roughly 60% to 70% of what they were in 2019, we should be a cash breakeven. But until we get to that point, we'll continue focusing on managing our capacity, our inventory, our pricing, our costs, our operations. Those things that we control, we will manage and control well. 
In terms of regional trends, beach and nature inspired destinations continue to outperform. We're seeing strength in Florida throughout Texas, Colorado, Arizona. California and Hawaii both began the fourth quarter with a curing momentum. Both quarantine and state home and reverse some of that. Some of our larger markets in the Northeast, Midwest, like New York and Chicago, are underperforming. So I'm not trying to give you an exhaustive list, but it does give you some perspective of what we're seeing. 
As you know, the international test requirements mike alluded to this, took effect on Tuesday. Our teams are ready to go, and we really have very few, if any, operational issues. We did see international cancellations increase a bit just prior to the new requirements go into effect. But we're actually continuing to slowly build load factors from March and beyond. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that, but keeps managing accordingly. In terms of our flight schedules, we're in the process of making more scheduled adjustments to march to better match capacity to current booking trends. Our outlook for Q1 capacity, I characterize as remaining cautious, and we're expecting first quarter ASM to decrease around 35% year-over-year. 
Just real quick, I do want to give a quick update on our new markets. As you know, over the past several months, we've announced 12 new airports with 4 of these airports up and running. and 8 more coming online over the coming months. We've outlined all this in the earnings release, so I'm not going to repeat it all here. But I will say that I think this is the bread and butter of Southwest Group. The question of why now is very, very easy to answer. First, we have the aircraft, we have the people that do it. And second, we're going after new revenue pools. 
In the airports that we're adding fit into our network very cleanly and they leverage our strong Southwest customer base in very strong Southwest markets. When you think about the new markets such as Continental in Houston, Chicago, O'Hare, Miami, these are also very important for business travel, which is very relevant. 
The response to our new service so far has been very good, performance Miami, Palm Springs, Metros, Napa Valley was strong in the fourth quarter. So we're quite pleased what we're seeing. Our start-up costs were very modest and new revenue from these airports, even this early on, more than cover the incremental cost of bringing airports online in the cost of operating flights. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to strengthen and mature these new stations, and we see the long-term outlook as being very, very strong, very positive. In the near term, though, just like the rest of the system, there's always demand risk. But again, we're very pleased with early signs to these new markets see. 
One last thing. I just want to quickly cover where we are with our corporate travel work is our reported last quarter. Right now, we are live with 4 GDS platforms, Amadeus and Apollo, Gallo and Willa platforms. And I'm also really pleased and happy that we're able to reach an agreement with Sabre at the end of last year. Our new agreement with Sabre is similar to those with Amadeus and [indiscernible] participation and industry-standard capabilities that will allow TMS function. Now on 4 weeks into this, we're working through our implementation plan, but our target is to go live in the second half of 2021, which I think will go inside with return to business travel. 
In terms of content, we'll certainly have more than 90% of our content available through Sabre. And again, this is consistent with what we're currently doing with or travel for an on ads. We'll always have 100% of our content available through our swabs and API business change. And I said this before, I think it  is worth repeating. Doing 90% of the domestic business rail book is coach And I really think we have the best coach product in industry. We have a great point-to-point network, and that's strengthening with our new cities. We have low fares with flexibility. We have industry-leading customer service and hospitality. You've heard about that today. We have a great loyalty program, and we deployed our Southwest sales teams to our key markets. Our challenge in the past is that we weren't in the GDS channel, which is where most business travel is booked and that gap is closed. We intend to compete aggressively, and that's what you expect with us that's what we expect of ourselves. 
Based on what we're seeing and learning from our customers and also from outside research, our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly and by the end of 2021 perhaps it could still be in the range of down 50% to 60%. But again, from our perspective, even if business revenue is smaller, post pandemic, there's still a lot of upside for Southwest. So these 2 commercial focus areas: first, a market to our network; and second, our entry to GDS in ultimately means that more itinerary combinations consist with in our network. We have more passengers, more revenue opportunities and very simply more opportunities to grow Southwest. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, Tammy."

I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. .Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful",3146,"All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. .
Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits, which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. 
While our bottom line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For our fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year-over-year on a unit basis. 
Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67% with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year-over-year. Following 3 quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per gallon range. 
Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year, and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020, simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon And our full year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first quarter premium expense of $25 million and full year estimated premium expense of $100 million. 
Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year-over-year driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service, given our capacity cuts. Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 6 -- 5% to 6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, fourth quarter operating costs were down 23% year-over-year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity. 
Our fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 300 -- $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights driven maintenance expense, landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs. 
We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary programs; and we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments as well as discretionary spending. We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. 
In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees, and that is 7% in the voluntary lead program with 18% participating in extended time off. 
I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these 2 voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a 5-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion. 
In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and  that covered the time period from second quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and, of course, record further accruals, if appropriate. 
We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. 
So those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth quarter 2020 and $565 million for full year 2020. 
For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. We continue to expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs, which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended lead programs give us a lot of flexibility should the business recover fast, and we determine we need to recall employees. 
Our Swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people for their swift action and laser focus on strict cost control. Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first quarter 2021, we expect first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, are relatively in line with our fourth quarter results as capacity remains down, and we continue to benefit from savings driven by reduced capacity levels as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave program. 
While we are not providing full year 2021 cost guidance, as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight driven expenses such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance expense and landing fees. We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and did the time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rates of inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as aircraft rentals as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. 
We will also have more heavy maintenance checks in particular, for our 800 fleet Overall, changes in our nonfuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvement. On a fuel constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost, although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. 
There have been significant cost reductions across the industry. And I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. 
For Southwest, we are a growth airline with the cost structure to support growth, and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet and product offering. We are very well positioned for our recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. As a full cash taxpayer for the past 5 years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and in 2016 until the passage of tax reform in 2017. 
For our first quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22%. And as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. 
Turning to fleet and CapEx. I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years. Weather, through retirements to adjust to lower demand, are through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity when the environment supports growth. As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. 
During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX 8 aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. In December, we received 7 of those, which were leased aircraft, and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year. well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. 
During 2020, we returned 12 -700 aircraft and retired 24 owned -700s, including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned -700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter, treated as a special item. And we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new, more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. 
We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million, which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020. 
When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment projects for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020, and we will continue to do the same in 2021. 
Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021, and we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology, facilities and operational investments. 
Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic, we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. 
Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion, including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances, sale-leaseback transaction, a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments, we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet, and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and had leverage of 56%. 
We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021. 
We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion, of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far, our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion. 
Turning to cash burn. Our fourth quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020 despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. Given our current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices. 
And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. We currently estimate our first quarter cash burn, including working capital to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary bound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. 
In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented, to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. 
Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry, and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. 
With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels, and we will continue the momentum from 2020 in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. 
We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. 
As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic and will continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade. 
As our founder, Herb Kelleher would say, ""We will not sit on our laurels."" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters, and we are all up for the challenges ahead. 
With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions."

So of course, our goal there is to maintain sufficient liquidity. And it's tough to predict, as we've been saying, exactly when we'll hit an inflection point, but we intend to maintain a high level of cash until we are comfortably past the pandemic. 
In the current environment, we have agreed with our Board that a cash target for now of at least $10 billion is reasonable. And we can go down from there post pandemic as we return to profitability and repay debt. 
One thing for sure, this crisis has certainly reinforced our long-term imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage our debt. And of course, we'll want to satisfy adequate reserves for investments as we prepare for the recovery and our future growth. As always, we want to maintain adequate liquidity to weather a crisis, which seems to happen once a decade. As we set our targets here post pandemic, we'll want to be mindful that a large portion of our working capital is advanced ticket purchases, which may not serve as a definite source of liquidity when we're in a crisis. 
So there are a lot of factors to consider with regard to liquidity, and we'll continue to be thoughtful as we work together to maintain the financial health of Southwest. And as we manage through that on the CapEx side, I think we've done an incredible job so far, but we want to be well positioned for the recovery, and that we'll have some level of CapEx that we'll need to spend to continue to be prepared for the future. As I've already stated, we have very minimal requirements this year. And we'll want to manage that into next year, while at the same time, we'll want to continue to invest in projects that are important for our future such as our GDS capabilities that Tom took you through. So we're going to continue to manage that. 
But as our profitability returns to normal levels, I would expect our CapEx to return more to normal levels. And we're just going to have to manage that here as we go."

So we owe you that bracketing. 
One of the things that I want us to do this year is to not think that we're starting over as a company, but there are some start-up-like aspects to this environment. And we're well-funded. We've got a lot of -- we've got a lot of institutional capabilities. We've got a lot of opportunities. We just don't have a lot of current demand. So we don't want to behave as if we're going out of business, and there are things that we would definitely like to invest in outside of the fleet, which Tammy was referring to. 
So all that, I want us to relook at, rebaseline our capital plan, and it really applies to both. It's not just aircraft, but it will also be the nonaircraft category. 
What we've been focused on so far, obviously, is survival. and making sure that we screw down the spending that we're taking care of the health and welfare of our people and our customers. And those very appropriate questions you have -- they're not pressing for 2020 and 2021, but soon, they'll be important. I think the most pressing thing, just to reiterate what Tammy said is that we are in a retirement phase. So we will need to make some judgments about whether we want to keep airplanes longer, whether we want to stick with our pre-pandemic plan about retirements, whether we need to follow through with replacing. There is great opportunity with fleet modernization. So those are all good questions. 
And then finally, Mike and Tammy are working with Boeing, as you all know, and we're right in the middle of that negotiation. That obviously factors in to answering your question. So that's not complete yet either. So there's work to be done there, and we owe you an answer. We're just not quite ready to offer it up yet."

We're excited about Long Beach, what we're doing there. We're excited about opening up the San Diego service that was delayed. I guess, it was initially last fall, Andrew, we just started that up. So I think the upside for us in Hawaii continues to be really significant. So excited about that. And the MAX 8 as makes it even better. So it actually expands the territory we can cover as well. So new cities with that so -- good to hear from you honor."

But basically, we need to arrive at a strategy that we can all agree to. And then logic would tell you then there's things that we can't agree to. And then therefore, that falls outside of the scope of what the association would work for or work on. 
So I don't know that it's so much driven by Southwest business or our strength or weaknesses so much as it is just what I'll try to do to lead the organization in a fair-handed way to be as productive as we can. I think the A4A is a very talented organization. We've been members since, I think, 1990. There was a time -- therefore, there was a time that we were not members. So it's a long horizon. We think it's better to be -- have a seat at the table and be a part of that as opposed to not. And I thought the association did a great job in 2020, in particular. You got a new administration, which is a task in and of itself as well as another stimulus that's being bandied about. 
So there's plenty of work to be done and I'm looking forward -- I was honored to be asked to do it and happy to volunteer, and I'll be spending more time in Washington as a consequence of that."

I'll let Tammy give you -- she is working on that, and she no doubt I can give you a more thoughtful answer. But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it.

But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it. 
I was very, very pleased with the operational performance in 2020. And we got a bounce -- with the ball bounced our way in some ways because we were underutilizing the fleet. We had longer turn times. We had lower load factors and some things like that. But it doesn't really reveal all the work that Mike and Andrew and the rest of the organization has been working on to improve our operational performance. 
What was intended to be addressed in 2020 and 2021 is further efficiency efforts with the schedule. And that's the real magic here in terms of being able to improve our cost effectiveness. And so I think we're all curious -- I'm just not ready to -- I don't really know what 2019 capacity looks like. We are horribly inefficient right now and still doing a pretty good job relative to our peers. So what we've got to do is get back to some kind of aircraft productivity and efficiency and then layer on top of that our initiatives that we had planned to see where we get. 
I'm very enthused about the progress we've made with the cost so far. I think you got this from Tammy's update. But basically, if you strip out fuel, the costs are -- they don't vary much from fourth quarter to first quarter, which is pretty d*** encouraging. So we've definitely stripped out a lot of costs, I think, in terms of a lot of the more discretionary investment like programs and projects, especially that were technology driven, we feel like we've gained significant efficiencies there post pandemic compared to where we were before. So good for us. And so I think a lot of those things should stick. 
Then you just get down to, are you going to have 85% load factors again. Are we going to have a dense scheduling opportunity again? Can we improve the turn and the ground time and continue on with some of the block time efficiencies that we were realizing? And if we can do all that, I think we'll beat the 2019 costs handily, quite frankly. But that's in fairness. I think that's speculative right now. I think we have a long way to go. Right now, it's taking more people and more airplanes to produce an ASM than any of us like and far more than what it was in 2019. So I'm more determined to get us back there than I am so worried about what all the arithmetic adds up to. 
So that's -- Tammy, I don't know how you would answer that question."

I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency, as Gary took you through, we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we have accelerated the retirement of some aircraft here in 2019. And I think we have a proven track record on just the overall cost management side. So we'll continue to work hard there through the recovery. I did just want to note fuel because, obviously, part of that is dependent on fuel, which has spiked recently. So we'll just continue to manage costs at a pace that I think makes sense relative to the capacity that we're adding back. 
The MAX return to surface will also be a factor. But as you all know, there's a lot of efficiencies that we're going to gain as we start bringing the MAX back and replacing our older aircraft given the significant efficiency of the MAX. And so we -- again, it's hard to commit to a specific CASM at a specific ASM level. That is time-based. So we're not going to give guidance there. But we do believe we could hit 2019 CASM levels, as Gary said, even while our ASMs are down. 
So again, just as I said in my remarks, very proud of what everybody has done. Everybody's just rallied together here to reduce our costs, and we're going to carry that on here until we get to the other side of this pandemic."

And I'm a little afraid that some of our -- well, I think trying to make a commitment on cost right now is getting the cart before the horse. So we need to know what demand is. We need to schedule to that. We need to make it as efficient as we can and then strive to get back to the level of efficiency that we had with our schedule back in 2019 and then add some. 
As Tammy said, there's some overhead and things that we've taken out, but it's going to be all about the schedule. I think we're set up beautifully to be able to execute better in the future on cost. And I think we're all anxious to get there. When we'll hit that? Don't know. But I think we're set up as well as any of our competitors. In fact, I would argue we're set up better."

And so I think your question then and my concerns then proved to be valid. 
I don't know what they're going to be able to do. I think at least in terms of what I'm seeing right now, our costs are stickier as we shrink. We don't outsource a lot of stuff, as you know, which is much easier to shed. And so we are more fixed and sticky on the way down. 
I think several of you all have noted that as we grow back, that will be to our advantage. So we'll see margin expansion because we won't have the variable cost to attach to that as the revenue volumes come back. 
That's one of the reasons I wanted to point out the operational performance for 2020. As we -- it's all about the operation when you get right down to it when it comes to cost. And we had tremendous learnings from 2020, just the fact that, I mean, we could quantify the value of an on-time performance point much more scientifically than what we've been able to do in the past. And it's things that we've all learned, if not in school then in our early years that when you have poor quality or you have waste, it is very expensive. 
So we've got a lot of wonderful learnings from that and a lot of good tools and techniques to apply with a lot of good initiatives coming forward. I know I'm being a little bit redundant. So those are things that I know. 
If our cost advantage narrows, I think I could point to the last 10 to 20 years and say, ""We're still really good."" And it's more than just that. It's the 5 things that I mentioned that Herb was so proud of 25 years ago. It's the strong balance sheet. It's the strong liquidity. It's the great culture that we have, the excellent customer service, coupled with having a low-cost structure and a low fare brand. It's all those things combined. So I don't see us losing that. We certainly won't lose it in the near term. 
And the advantage is narrowed. My theory -- and you and I have talked about this. My theory is that there's going to ebb and flow and there may be a point in time where it will widen again. So it's kind of incumbent upon us to continue to innovate and look for those opportunities where we can beat the rest of the crowd."

So I hope you'll forgive me skirting the question a bit here because what we really urge our leaders to do is focus on the next 30, 60, 90 days. It's just like having a patient and intensive care. 
So to be fair to your question, again, it links back to some of the earlier questions I was trying to answer from Hunter and Duane. If we get to the point where our demand is roughly what it was in 2019, I think there's an easier way to formulate answers to your questions. If we've got a new normal that is significantly less than that, maybe we're breaking even and making a profit, but our traffic levels are 70% of what they used to be, there's not a lot we can do in the near term to honestly commit to you that, yes, we'll get back to the same return on capital there. I don't think it's possible at 70%. If we get back to 100% of customer volumes, then it is a matter of where fares at that point, what's the mix of business and leisure. We can get wonky on all those things but it's just so far -- it's so theoretical from where we are today. 
My -- so I will answer your question. My focus is real simple, and that's why I crafted my opening remarks the way I did. We need to strike the right balance here, and we need to be realistic. We know that we can't generate the traffic we need unless we boost our flying. There is no reason to boost our flying if the traffic isn't going to be there. All we will do is waste money. So we have to be very focused on getting that balance right and reacting as quickly as we can. What we've tried to do is maintain optionality so we don't prolong that recovery period. And I think that, that's worked out beautifully for us better than -- it can't be any worse than any of our other competitors. So I think we're in a prime position to do that, and that is my focus. 
Now once we get to that point, I think we need to work on resetting what our near-term targets need to be, what kind of profits -- there was a question about capital spending. I think the capital spending depends on what is our profitability and what can we afford to do and still maintain a strong balance sheet. All that we need to iterate and I will welcome getting to the point where those are the kinds of things that we can then focus on. But our rally cry for our people this year is really simple. It is win more customers and stop the bleeding. That's what we've got to do. And that will put us on a platform where we can then get to the next thing, which will be, let's pay down this debt, and let's make sure that we are at a sustainable level of profitability that will then lead to what can we afford from a capital program for the next 5 years. 
So it's just an uncertain time like none of us have ever seen in our lives. And anybody that tries to give you a real specific answer to those kinds of questions, they're just -- they're not telling you the truth. And that's -- and that's the god's honest truth. We just -- we don't know, but we are prepared to manage and respond and we're determined to do it better than anybody else."

I know that unions have reached out like they did last year, urging leaders in the administration and Congress to provide more relief. We -- I will just -- I know you know this, but I'll just acknowledge that the theory with the second payroll support program was to simply extend what was done the first time, which was through September for another 6 months. And the payroll support program in rough dollars was $25 billion, the first time around. Well, it was far less than that here the second time around. And we're staring down another -- in terms of cash flow, $1 billion losing quarter here in the first quarter, just like we had in the fourth quarter with higher fuel prices. 
So this is certainly not ended, and it's anybody's guess what the second quarter will be. So this is all about protecting jobs. And we're the only airline to promise no job losses or pay cuts in 2020. We lived up to that. We promised the same thing again here in 2021. That doesn't mean that we won't have risk and concerns beyond this. So we're not promising this indefinitely. And all airlines are alike.

With respect to coming into the U.S., it's not clear -- first of all, it's not clear if, when, what, how we'd be asked to do that. But it's certainly something that we're thinking about. If it were something similar to what's being required internationally, how would we do that domestically? And right now, the international is -- it's a pretty manual process because it's sprung upon all this so quickly, so you got to get the technology and to scale that domestically. 
Well, I will say what I think, if that's -- if you don't mind. I think if we're ultimately going to be doing a domestic testing type of -- or type of protocol or regimen. I really don't think you want this being done by airport, by airline, by city, by state. I think, as we say in Texas, that could be a real [indiscernible] rodeo.

We're reading the same things you're reading, the CDC. And we're anticipating hearing something from somebody, but we're thinking about it. They want to figure it out fairly quickly.

And so specific to your question, I'm not aware that the CDC has reached out to us. By extension, I'm not aware that they reached out to the airlines for America. But yes, I think it would be a mistake. It's very costly. 
As Tammy was pointing out in an earlier interview to administer the test, we don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place where our emphasis needs to be is on the 2 vaccines that are available and getting them rolled out and getting the country vaccinated. And I would hate for us to take our eye off of that ball. But I would just make the argument that why pick on air travel. If you want to test people, test them, but test them before they go to grocery store, test them before they go to a restaurant, test them before they go to a sporting event. 
The -- I think it's been well recognized that the air cabin is extremely clean and healthy and safe. And with the new administration mandating mask in the transportation sector, that's what we need the most, which is hygiene, wearing mask, social distancing, we should now better extend in the airport and beyond. That's the right approach here. And I just think with the millions of customers who fly or ride buses or trains or whatever, it's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a large scale."

I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in trying to get access to test through friends and family is extremely difficult. And that's before now you would mandate that you want more test administered. I just think it's wholly impractical. And obviously, we -- selfishly, we hope that we don't get to a point where we're prohibited from flying, but that's a different question and something, obviously, that needs to be addressed.

So we're working through that at this point with our customer experience team and our provisioning team and operations and in-flight team are working through when does it make sense for us to do it. It very will can be sometime in the first quarter. I think a lot of it really does have to do though with what we're seeing in terms of case counts. And I just looked at the case counts before coming into the call. In every state pretty much, I should say, I think there were 1 or 2 that were still going up. Case counts are down, hospitalizations and down, and so on and so forth, and that certainly has a bearing on how we think about it. 
And so I'd say it's still a work in process. Our intent is to bring it back. We'd love to have it back in time for spring break. That is to be decided, to be chosen or determined.

We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19, and we recognized our first annual loss since 197",753,"Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19, and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry.
We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion, including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our frequent flyer program. We have the strongest balance sheet, and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt.  
Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability, and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that, in turn, has resulted in unprecedented job security, especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic. And I'm very, very proud of that.
We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances, it was released this week, was Southwest as #1. And finally, we have the best customer service, and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that once again, we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of fewest customer complaints.  
Now no one can deny that, that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me, as I was recapping that, I was listening to Herb many years ago, he pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category, much less 5. And I mentioned these things really not to brag, but just to put things in perspective. And that is to say that yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our start-up year. But we have much to be grateful for, and we have every reason to be hopeful that this, too, shall pass. And when it does, we will be ready.  
And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven and then beyond that, prosperity. So there's a balancing act here, and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic, and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key, and we're intensely focused on that.  
And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience, and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February, winter doldrum, we'll see what happens, and we'll respond accordingly.  
So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder, except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for. And we do, and especially at Southwest. 
And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again. I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could -- would join me and say how proud we are of them, and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes.
So some of these heroes are sitting here with me. And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO."

We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed government support, and that allowed us to pivot away from those time-consuming discussions about furloughs and concessions and job security.  
We were able to grow our city portfolio and the vaccines rollout began. And beneath all of those things, Southwest produced our overall best quarterly operational performance in our history.  
And as Gary mentioned, I too have just -- I'm very proud and very grateful to our people. There's tremendous activity associated with all those items I just mentioned. And in addition to those things, though, our people still go to work every day and they deal with day-to-day issues of a pandemic environment, and yet they never lose their focus on our customers, on our company or each other. And they are just a great team. 
So for the fourth quarter, our on-time performance of 93% was industry-leading and the best in our history. We finished the year at 86%, and that was the best since 2003. Our baggage handling was equally as impressive with just over 2 bags per 1,000 carried being damaged or mishandled. So if you flip that around, that's about a 99.8% accuracy rate. And again, the best in our history and in the top tier in the industry.  
That reliability, coupled with our hospitality, produced Net Promoter Scores in the mid-70s for the fourth quarter and for the year. So again, the best performance in our history. And we do expect to lead the industry once more with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio when those are published.  
So to cap it all off, we finished 2020 with the best overall operational performance of any U.S. airline as measured by the Wall Street Journal's Middle Seat Scorecard. So as I've said before, just a great team.  
Our fleet has been a particular focus as of late. We now have a combination of additional aircraft available to us from the MAX return to service as well as a lower demand environment from this pandemic. And that gives our tech ops department several options to optimize our maintenance costs by storing some of our older aircraft and replacing any necessary flying with our most efficient aircraft, the MAX. 
The MAX is more reliable. It has a lower fuel burn. It's quieter. It's less expensive to maintain, and it's our most comfortable aircraft from a customer perspective. And it is a key component of our future.  
So we took delivery of 7 leased MAXes from Boeing in December. And if you combine that with the 34 MAXes we had in storage in Victorville, that brought our MAX fleet to 41 aircraft by year-end. We also identified 20 of our older 737-700s that had an expensive near-term maintenance profile, and we accelerated their retirement at the year-end, and that brought our fleet total down to 718 aircraft for use in the operation as we go into 2021.  
There are 60 NGs included in that year-end fleet count in a long-term storage program. And so the rest of the airplanes, they rotate through our operation and our short-term parking program or they're in heavy maintenance visits. And that approach gives us tremendous near-term flexibility to either slow down or accelerate flight activity as demand dictates. 
So March 11 is when the MAX returns to revenue flying. All of our pilots will have been trained. We will have had over 200 validation or readiness flight tests completed. And we'll be starting out in a very small and focused manner for the first month with just 10 lines of flying. They'll be isolated to all MAX lines. We will not co-mingle the NG and the MAX fleet for that first month of service. After that, we'll have roughly 65 MAX aircraft available for service, and we expect to be in normal operational mode by mid-April. We'll end 2021 with 69 MAX aircraft.  
In closing, with the fleet, we plan on running similar retirement analysis to optimize maintenance costs in 2021, just like we did in 2020. And we don't expect our fleet to grow in 2021 as compared to the 747 aircraft at year-end 2019. We do continue to evaluate our longer-term fleet needs, and we are in discussions with Boeing as to our order book beyond 2021. 
As we do start this new year, we do have our eye on a couple of other critical operational areas. First, we are initiating operations in 8 new locations by June 6. There's quite a bit of coordination and facility build-out, staffing equipage and security-related actions that go into opening up a new location. And Gary, I think 8 between now and early June, is another all-time Southwest record. And that is a very impressive team.  
Second, we are in a very reactive environment with respect to COVID restrictions. There are new international requirements with testing and attestation protocols. They are evolving domestic requirements, and there are various mask-related challenges that our teams are reacting to every day.  
So it does take a special team to be able to deliver record-breaking operating results, managing a complicated fleet environment, bringing the MAX back into service and optimizing retirements of older airplanes to open up 8 new locations in 4 months and just to adjust on the fly to constantly changing COVID requirements.  
And I think about our people, and they make all of that look so easy, and they do it every day. And as I said, they're just a special team, and I'm really proud to be a part of it.  
And I think with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you."

What a year, what a result and really proud of what we've accomplished with the team.  
In prior calls, I've always made a point of recognizing our commercial teams, our network planning, revenue management, the marketing folks, Southwest business, the customer relations team and they deserve that again. I mean what they're doing is absolutely incredible. But I also do want to recognize a few teams. They are always in that ground, that if they aren't there, nothing else happens. Our technology teams, our finance teams, our strategy teams and so many others. So they've done incredible work over the past year, honestly, that I cannot even imagine or envision. So thanks so much for what you're doing.  
So I do want to provide a quick recap of our fourth quarter revenue performance. And then I'll cover our near-term trends and guidance for the first quarter. So our fourth quarter operating revenue was down 65% year-over-year, which is a modest sequential improvement compared with the 68% decline that we experienced in the third quarter. 
Fourth quarter passengers declined 64% year-over-year, and our average fares were down 14%, which is a favorable comp to fares being down 20% in the third quarter. We did see some pockets of sequential yield in premium, which was encouraging.  
Our fourth quarter load factor was 54%, which was up from 45% in the third quarter. And this was driven primarily by a boost in the December load factor at 60%. And as you all know, you look at our CCAP on December 1. And this is all on fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year. 
Just a few monthly performance highlights, if you will. October leisure demand and bookings held up well compared to September and that's despite September benefiting from Labor Day holiday travel. October operating revenues were down 64% with a load factor of 55%, capacity down 44% as all on a year-over-year basis. So given the environment, that was a pretty encouraging result for October.  
November, though, we did begin to see a slowing of revenue trends. We expected to see that, that will coincide with the presidential elections, but we never got back on to our pre-election trends, which in hindsight, I suppose, is surprising, given that COVID cases and hospitalizations are on the rise, along with new quarantine requirements, travel restrictions, government orders, et cetera, et cetera, and all these are the primary drivers of the softness in demand. And coincidentally, we also saw an increase in trip cancellations in the weeks we have for Thanksgiving. 
Relative to the rest of the month, leisure demand was more resilient to the Thanksgiving travel period, even with the worsening pandemic background. The November operating revenues benefited 1 to 2 points year-over-year due to the holiday timing shift from 2019. 
So November finished with operating revenues down 63% with a load factor of 48% and capacity down 35%. Again, all on a year-over-year comp basis. December had many of the same challenges we saw in November, with a continued surge in COVID cases, a softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings and elevated trip cancellations. 
And similar to Thanksgiving, leisure demand for December holiday travel outpaced non-holiday time periods. In December, leisure revenue trends were supported by some pockets of strength. 
Operating revenues for December were down 67% year-over-year with a load factor of 60%, both of which were in line with our guidance, and that was on capacity that was down 43% year-over-year. And just as a reminder, the holiday shift in 2019 had a negative impact of 6 to 7 points year-over-year for December.  
Let's see, regarding middle seats, we estimate an operating income penalty of $30 million in October and a $10 million penalty in November. So really no surprise there. And as you know, and as referenced, we opened up all seats for availability beginning December 1. So for December, we estimate a revenue boost of around $80 million as a result of selling all seats.  
Our December load factor was up 12 points versus November. And our yields were down month-over-month. But if you adjust for the year-over-year calendar impact of holidays, December's year-over-year revenues improved 4 points sequentially as compared to November. And again, this was very much in line with what we were expecting.  
In terms of the demand environment, it clearly continues to be heavily leisure oriented. Business demand continues to be very weak, and our corporate managed travel was down 87% in the fourth quarter, which was actually a slight improvement in the third quarter, but we have no real movement to speak of. And we expect business travel to be down -- to remain down significantly this year. I don't think that's surprising to anybody. 
As you know, January and February are typically heavy business travel months, but the absence of business travel is making a weaker leisure travel period even more challenging, and I'll talk about that in just a few minutes here.  
I do want to hit on very quickly a few highlights of our other revenue, which was down 18% year-over-year, which is obviously much less than the decline we experienced in passenger revenues. And as you expect, for products like early bird and upgraded boarding, revenue has trended almost right in line with the passenger decline that we're seeing. 
However, we've seen a much stronger revenue performance for our Rapid Rewards program. Revenue from our Rapid Rewards program is down 38% year-over-year, which, again, is a solid improvement from the decrease of 43% in the third quarter. And aside from that, for card redemptions, rather, for travel, our loyalty program continues to perform very, very well. 
Our credit card portfolio is a real point of strength for us, I think, a differentiator, and we're continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit cards, which reinforces what I've said many times, which is that our cards really are top of the wallet for customers for everyday purchases as well as for air travel.  
In fact, revenue from card spend in the fourth quarter performed well and was down only 11% year-over-year. We're also continuing to acquire new Rapid Rewards members and new cardholders, although at a slower rate, simply because there are fewer people traveling. So in spite of the environment, the size of our program is essentially unchanged, which I think is a pretty powerful statement given the environment.  
You may have seen we recently provided all Rapid Rewards members with a boost. They're qualifying points towards A-List to A-List Preferred and Companion Pass status. And these, as you know, are very -- most valued customers, and we value them tremendously, and they value us, and they certainly value their tier status. 
So to close out Q4, I just -- I do want to hit a few things that Gary and Mike referenced, and that's our brand NPS score as well as our DOT customer sat rankings. Both were the best scores in the industry, and we are very proud of that. But I will tell you that we don't take it for granted. We worked really hard to get those results. And our people worked really hard to get those results. 
Specifically to the DOT customer sat score, we had a ratio of 2.91 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded, which is far, far ahead of our competition. And it's just an incredible result. And again, it comes down to our people, to our hospitality, and to our customer service, to our culture and what we believe in. So I just want to say, thanks to our folks for that. 
So that's it for the fourth quarter. We'll move into the Q1. Well, at this point, we are nearly done with January and demand has remained, as you keep seeing, stalled. We expect January operating revenues to decrease 65% to 70% with a load factor of 50% to 55%, with ASMs being down 41%. And again, that's all on a year-over-year basis. 
And this compares slightly favorably to our mid-December guidance ranges for both revenue and load factor. And January demand has held pretty steady over the past month or so. And I think in this environment, steady, honestly, isn't so bad. So I'll take that right now. 
In February, we expect a fairly similar revenue performance in January, but January did benefit from stronger holiday return travel during the first week of the month. We really don't see a real catalyst for February demand at this point. And as you know, this is historically a low month for leisure travel. And the business travel that normally filled the demand simply isn't showing up. 
We currently expect February operating revenues to decrease 65% to 75% year-over-year, with a load factor of 50% to 55% and capacity at 46% year-over-year -- down 46% year-over-year. And at this point, we aren't providing March revenue guidance, but we'll be certainly providing an 8-K in mid-February, and we'll cover all that. But I did think it's worth sharing a few thoughts about what we're seeing beyond February at this point in time. 
So it is still pretty early in our booking curve for March and April, but relative to January and February, we are seeing a slight uptick in bookings for both months. We're behind in the booking curve. We've said that previously. versus where we'd normally be. But given the situation, I don't think that's a surprise. I think that's to be expected. 
You likely saw that we've had more promotional activity than usual, including a recent air sale that included the March and April travel period. That's unusual for us. In fact, we're talking about this the other day, and I don't think any of us could recall doing a wild sale in January. But that's where we are and the goal is simple, we need to stimulate travel. We need to get more bookings in place. 
And I'd say the sales performed pretty much in line with our expectations. But for now, we're not seeing a material boost in bookings for March. But having said that, we are continuing to build load factors every week, and the booking curve continues to be skewed close in, so we do expect bookings to continue to fill in. 
What's not clear though is to what degree. We could be surprised to the upside, but at this point, there's no real clear revenues on that quite yet. We've shared this with you all before, but once we get back to operating revenues, they're roughly 60% to 70% of what they were in 2019, we should be at cash breakeven. But until we get to that point, we'll continue focusing on managing our capacity, our inventory, our pricing, our costs, our operations. Those things that we control, we will manage and control well.  
In terms of regional trends, beach and nature inspired destinations continue to outperform. We're seeing strength in Florida throughout Texas, Colorado, Arizona. California and Hawaii both began the fourth quarter with encouraging momentum. The quarantine and stay-at-home orders will reverse some of that. Some of our larger markets in the Northeast, Midwest, like New York and Chicago, are underperforming. So I'm not trying to give you an exhaustive list, but it does give you some perspective of what we're seeing.  
As you know, the international testing requirements, Mike alluded to this, took effect on Tuesday. Our teams are ready to go, and we really have very few, if any, operational issues. We did see international cancellations increase a bit just prior to the new requirements go into effect. But we're actually continuing to slowly build load factors for March and beyond. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that, but the loads keep managing accordingly.
In terms of our flight schedules, we're in the process of making more scheduled adjustments to March to better match capacity to current booking trends. Our outlook for Q1 capacity, I characterize as remaining cautious, and we're expecting first quarter ASM to decrease around 35% year-over-year.  
Just real quick, I do want to give a quick update on our new markets. As you know, over the past several months, we've announced 12 new airports, with 4 of these airports up and running and 8 more coming online over the coming months. We've outlined all this in the earnings release, so I'm not going to repeat it all here. But I will say that I think this is the bread and butter of Southwest Group. The question of why now is very, very easy to answer. First, we have the aircraft, we have the people that do it. And second, we're going after new revenue pools.  
And the airports that we're adding fit into our network very cleanly and they leverage our strong Southwest customer base in very strong Southwest markets. When you think about the new markets such as Bush Continental in Houston, Chicago O'Hare, Miami, these are also very important for business travel, which is very relevant.  
The response to our new service so far has been very good. Performance Miami, Palm Springs, Montrose, Yampa Valley was strong in the fourth quarter. So we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Our start-up costs were very modest and new revenue from these airports, even this early on, more than cover the incremental cost of bringing airports online and the cost of operating the flights. 
Looking ahead, we expect to continue to strengthen and mature these new stations, and we see the long-term outlook as being very, very strong, very positive. In the near term, though, just like the rest of the system, there's always demand risk. But again, we're very pleased with early signs to these new markets and cities.  
One last thing. I just want to quickly cover where we are with our corporate travel work as I reported last quarter. Right now, we are live with 4 GDS platforms, Amadeus and Travelport's Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan platforms. 
And I'm also very pleased and happy that we're able to reach an agreement with Sabre at the end of last year. Our new agreement with Sabre is similar to those with Amadeus and Travelport, full participation and industry-standard capabilities that will allow teams using their full GDS function. Now only 4 weeks into this and we're working through our implementation plan, where our target is to go live in the second half of 2021, which I think will coincide with return to business travel.
In terms of content, we'll certainly have more than 90% of our content available through Sabre. And again, this is consistent with what we're currently doing with booked travel for in Amadeus. And we'll always have 100% of our content available through our SWABIZ and API business channels.
And I said this before, I think it is worth repeating. 90% of domestic business travel being booked is coach. And I really think we have the best coach product in the industry. We have a great point-to-point network, and that's strengthening with our new cities. We have low fares with incredible flexibility. We have industry-leading customer service and hospitality. You've heard about that today. We have a great loyalty program, and we deployed our Southwest sales teams to our key markets. 
Our challenge in the past is that we weren't in the GDS channel, which is where most business travel is booked and that gap is closed. We intend to compete aggressively, and that's what you expect of us and that's what we expect of ourselves.
Based on what we're seeing and learning from our customers and also from outside research, our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly and by the end of 2021 perhaps it could still be in the range of down 50% to 60%. But again, from our perspective, even if business revenue is smaller, post pandemic, there's still a lot of upside for Southwest. 
So these 2 commercial focus areas: first, adding new markets to our network; and second, our entry into GDS ultimately means that more itinerary combinations exist with our network. We have more passengers, more revenue opportunities, and very simply, more opportunities to grow Southwest Airlines.  
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you, Tammy."

Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful",3144,"All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A.  
Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. 
Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits, which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. 
While our bottom line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year-over-year on a unit basis. 
Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67% with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year-over-year. 
Following 3 quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter, despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per gallon range. 
Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year, and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020, simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon and our full year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first quarter premium expense of $25 million and full year estimated premium expense of $100 million. 
Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. 
In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year-over-year, driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service, given our capacity cuts. 
Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 6 -- by 5% to 6% year-over-year. 
Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, fourth quarter operating costs were down 23% year-over-year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity.
Our fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 300 -- of $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights driven maintenance expense, the landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs.
We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary leave programs; and we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments as well as discretionary spending. 
We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. 
In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees, and that is 7% in the voluntary leave program with 18% participating in extended time off.
I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these 2 voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a 5-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion.
In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and that covered the time period from second quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. 
The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment and, of course, record further accruals, if appropriate.
We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. 
So those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth quarter 2020 and $565 million for full year 2020.
For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. 
We continue to expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs, which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended lead programs give us a lot of flexibility should the business recover fast, and we determine we need to recall employees. 
Our swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. 
The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion, taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. 
The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people for their swift action and laser focused on strict cost control. 
Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first quarter 2021, we expect first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, are relatively in line with our fourth quarter results as capacity remains down, and we continue to benefit from savings driven by reduced capacity levels as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave programs. 
While we are not providing full year 2021 cost guidance, as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight driven expenses such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance expense and landing fees. 
We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and extended time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rate inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as aircraft rentals as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. 
We will also have more heavy maintenance checks in particular for our -800 fleet. Overall, changes in our nonfuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvements. 
On a fuel constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost, although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. There have been significant cost reductions across the industry. And I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. 
For Southwest, we are a growth airline with the cost structure to support growth, and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet and product offering. 
We are very well positioned for a recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. 
Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. 
As a full cash taxpayer for the past 5 years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and 2016 until the passage of tax reform in 2017.
For first quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22%, as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. 
Turning to fleet and CapEx. I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity when the environment supports growth. 
As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX 8 aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. 
In December, we received 7 of those, which were leased aircraft, and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year, well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. 
During 2020, we returned 12 leased -700 aircraft and retired 24 owned -700s, including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned -700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter, treat it as a special item, and we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new, more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. 
Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million, which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020.
When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment project for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020, and we will continue to do the same in 2021.
Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021, and we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology, facilities and operational investments. Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic, we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. 
Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion, including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances, sale-leaseback transaction, a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments, we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet, and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and have leverage of 56%.
We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021.
We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion, of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. 
The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far, our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion.
Turning to cash burn. Our fourth quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020, despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. 
Given current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices.
And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. 
We currently estimate our first quarter cash burn, including working capital to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary rebound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. 
In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. 
Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry, and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. 
With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels, and we will continue the momentum from 2020 in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. 
We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. 
As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic and we'll continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade.
As our founder, Herb Kelleher would say, ""We will not sit on our laurels."" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters, and we are all up for the challenges ahead. 
With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions."

So of course, our goal there is to maintain sufficient liquidity. And it's tough to predict, as we've been saying, exactly when we'll hit an inflection point, but we intend to maintain a high level of cash until we are comfortably past the pandemic. 
In the current environment, we have agreed with our Board that a cash target for now of at least $10 billion is reasonable. And we can go down from there post pandemic as we return to profitability and repay debt. One thing for sure, this crisis has certainly reinforced our long-term imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage our debt. 
And of course, we'll want to satisfy the adequate reserves for investments as we prepare for the recovery and our future growth. As always, we'll want to maintain adequate liquidity to weather a crisis, which seems to happen once a decade. As we set our targets here post pandemic, we'll want to be mindful that a large portion of our working capital is advance ticket purchases, which may not serve as a definite source of liquidity when we're in a crisis.
So there are a lot of factors to consider with regard to liquidity, and we'll continue to be thoughtful as we work together to maintain the financial health of Southwest. And as we manage through that on the CapEx side, I think we've done an incredible job so far, but we want to be well positioned for the recovery, and that we'll have some level of CapEx that we'll need to spend to continue to be prepared for the future. 
As I've already stated, we have very minimal requirements this year. And we'll want to manage that into next year, while at the same time, we'll want to continue to invest in projects that are important for our future such as our GDS capabilities that Tom took you through. 
So we're going to continue to manage that. But as our profitability returns to normal levels, I would expect our CapEx to return more to normal levels. And we're just going to have to manage that here as we go."

So we haven't really locked that down yet. Obviously, we want to see how the demand environment evolves.

So -- but I would expect our CapEx levels to pick up as we get past the pandemic to more normal levels that you've seen in the past. 
But right now, I'm just not prepared to give you exact guidance because we haven't locked down our delivery book with Boeing. And as you know, our largest -- the largest portion of our CapEx goes to aircraft. And -- but we'll want to continue to invest in technologies and our facilities and so forth.

So we owe you that bracketing. 
One of the things that I want us to do this year is to not think that we're starting over as a company, but there are some start-up-like aspects to this environment. And we're well-funded. We've got a lot of -- we've got a lot of institutional capabilities. We've got a lot of opportunities. We just don't have a lot of current demand. 
So we don't want to behave as if we're going out of business, and there are things that we would definitely like to invest in outside of the fleet, which Tammy was referring to. So all that, I want us to relook at, rebaseline our capital plan, and it really applies to both. It's not just aircraft, but it will also be the non-aircraft category. 
What we've been focused on so far, obviously, is survival, and making sure that we screw down the spending, that we're taking care of the health and welfare of our people and our customers. And those very appropriate questions you have aren't -- they're not pressing for 2020 and 2021, but soon, they'll be important. 
I think the most pressing thing, just to reiterate what Tammy said, is that we are in a retirement phase. So we will need to make some judgments about whether we want to keep airplanes longer, whether we want to stick with our pre-pandemic plan about retirements, whether we need to follow through with replacing. There is great opportunity with fleet modernization. So those are all good questions. 
And then, finally, Mike and Tammy are working with Boeing, as you all know, and we're right in the middle of that negotiation. That obviously factors in to answering your question. So that's not complete yet either. 
So there's work to be done there, and we owe you an answer. We're just not quite ready to offer it up yet."

The precleared program that they've put in place now that several carriers are leveraging, it really does make the experience pretty straightforward. And the demand for Hawaii is actually very, very solid. So we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there.
We're excited about Long Beach, what we're doing there. We're excited about opening up the San Diego service that was delayed. I guess, it was initially last fall, Andrew, we just started that up. So I think the upside for us in Hawaii continues to be really significant.

But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it. 
I was really very pleased with the operational performance in 2020. And we got a bounce -- the ball bounced our way in some ways because we were underutilizing the fleet. We had longer turn times. You had lower load factors and some things like that. But it doesn't really reveal all the work that Mike and Andrew and the rest of the organization has been working on to improve our operational performance. 
What was intended to be addressed in 2020 and 2021 is further efficiency efforts with the schedule. And that's the real magic here in terms of being able to improve our cost effectiveness. And so I think we're all curious -- I'm just not ready to -- I don't really know what 2019 capacity looks like. We are horribly inefficient right now and still doing a pretty good job relative to our peers. So what we've got to do is get back to some kind of aircraft productivity and efficiency and then layer on top of that our initiatives that we had planned to see where we get. 
I'm very enthused about the progress we've made with the cost so far. I think you got this from Tammy's update. But basically, if you strip out fuel, the costs are -- they don't vary much from fourth quarter to first quarter, which is pretty darn encouraging. 
So we've definitely stripped out a lot of costs, I think, in terms of a lot of the more discretionary investment like programs and projects, especially that were technology driven. We feel like we've gained significant efficiencies there post pandemic compared to where we were before. So good for us. And so I think a lot of those things should stick.
Then you just get down to, are you going to have 85% load factors again? Are we going to have a dense scheduling opportunity again? Can we improve the turn and the ground time and continue on with some of the block time efficiencies that we were realizing? 
And if we can do all that, I think we'll beat 2019 costs handily, quite frankly. But that's, in fairness, I think that's speculative right now. I think we have a long way to go. Right now, it's taking more people and more airplanes to produce an ASM than any of us like and far more than what it was in 2019. So I'm more determined to get us back there than I am so worried about what all the arithmetic adds up to. 
So that's -- Tammy, I don't know how you would answer that question."

I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency, as Gary took you through, we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we",260,"Yes. I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency, as Gary took you through, we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we have accelerated the retirement of some aircraft here in 2019. And I think we have a proven track record on just the overall cost management side. So we'll continue to work hard there through the recovery. 
I did just want to note fuel because, obviously, part of that is dependent on fuel, which has spiked recently. So we'll just continue to manage costs at a pace that I think makes sense relative to the capacity that we're adding back. 
The MAX return to surface will also be a factor. But as you all know, there's a lot of efficiencies that we're going to gain as we start bringing the MAX back and replacing our older aircraft given the significant efficiency of the MAX. 
And so we -- again, it's hard to commit to a specific CASM at a specific ASM level. That is time-based. So we're not going to give guidance there. But we do believe we could hit 2019 CASM levels, as Gary said, even while our ASMs are down. 
So again, just as I said in my remarks, very proud of what everybody has done. Everybody's just rallied together here to reduce our costs, and we're going to carry that on here until we get to the other side of this pandemic."

We need to schedule to that. We need to make it as efficient as we can and then strive to get back to the level of efficiency that we had with our schedule back in 2019 and then add some. 
As Tammy said, there's some overhead and things we've taken out, but it's going to be all about the schedule. I think we're set up beautifully to be able to execute better in the future on cost. And I think we're all anxious to get there.

And so I think your question then and my concerns then proved to be valid. 
I don't know what they're going to be able to do. I think at least in terms of what I'm seeing right now, our costs are stickier as we shrink. We don't outsource a lot of stuff, as you know, which is much easier to shed. And so we are more ""fixed and sticky"" on the way down. 
I think several of you all have noted that as we grow back, that will be to our advantage. So we'll see margin expansion because we won't have the variable cost to attach to that as the revenue volumes come back. 
That's one of the reasons I wanted to point out the operational performance for 2020. As we -- it's all about the operation when you get right down to it when it comes to cost. And we had tremendous learnings from 2020, just the fact that, I mean, we could quantify the value of an on-time performance point much more scientifically than what we've been able to do in the past. And it's things that we've all learned, if not in school then in our early years that when you have poor quality or you have waste, it is very expensive. 
So we've got a lot of wonderful learnings from that and a lot of good tools and techniques to apply with a lot of good initiatives coming forward. I know I'm being a little bit redundant. So those are things that I know. 
If our cost advantage narrows, I think I could point to the last 10 to 20 years and say, ""We're still really good."" And it's more than just that. It's the 5 things that I mentioned that Herb was so proud of 25 years ago. It's the strong balance sheet. It's the strong liquidity. It's the great culture that we have, the excellent customer service, coupled with having a low-cost structure and a low fare brand. It's all those things combined. So I don't see us losing that. We certainly won't lose it in the near term. 
And the advantage is narrowed. My theory -- and you and I have talked about this. My theory is that those are going to ebb and flow and there may be a point in time where it will widen again. So it's kind of incumbent upon us to continue to innovate and look for those opportunities where we can beat the rest of the crowd."

It's just so theoretical because we're mired in this pandemic. So I hope you'll forgive me skirting the question a bit here because what we really urge our leaders to do is focus on the next 30, 60, 90 days. It's just like having a patient in intensive care.
So to be fair to your question, again, it links back to some of the earlier questions I was trying to answer from Hunter and Duane. If we get to the point where our demand is roughly what it was in 2019, I think there's an easier way to formulate answers to your questions. 
If we've got a new normal that is significantly less than that, maybe we're breaking even and making a profit, but our traffic levels are 70% of what they used to be, there's not a lot we can do in the near term to honestly commit to you that, yes, we'll get back to the same return on capital there. I don't think it's possible at 70%. 
If we get back to 100% of customer volumes, then it is a matter of where fares at that point, what's the mix of business and leisure. We can get wonky on all those things, but it's just so far -- it's so theoretical from where we are today. 
My -- so I will answer your question. My focus is real simple, and that's why I crafted my opening remarks the way I did. We need to strike the right balance here, and we need to be realistic. We know that we can't generate the traffic we need unless we boost our flying. There is no reason to boost our flying if the traffic isn't going to be there. All we will do is waste money. 
So we have to be very focused on getting that balance right and reacting as quickly as we can. What we've tried to do is maintain optionality so we don't prolong that recovery period. And I think that, that's worked out beautifully for us, better than -- it can't be any worse than any of our other competitors. So I think we're in a prime position to do that, and that is my focus. 
Now once we get to that point, I think we need to work on resetting what our near-term targets need to be, what kind of profits -- there was a question about capital spending. I think the capital spending depends on what is our profitability and what can we afford to do and still maintain a strong balance sheet. 
All that we'll need to iterate and I will welcome getting to the point where those are the kinds of things that we can then focus on. But our rally cry for our people this year is really simple. It is win more customers and stop the bleeding. That's what we've got to do. 
And that will put us on a platform where we can then get to the next thing, which will be, let's pay down this debt, and let's make sure that we are at a sustainable level of profitability that will then lead to what can we afford from a capital program for the next 5 years. 
So it's just an uncertain time like none of us have ever seen in our lives. And anybody that tries to give you a real specific answer to those kinds of questions, they're just -- they're not telling you the truth. And that's -- and that's the god's honest truth. We just -- we don't know, but we are prepared to manage and respond and we're determined to do it better than anybody else."

But at this point, we would like to have a seat at the table. I know that unions have reached out like they did last year, urging leaders in the administration and Congress to provide more relief. 
We -- I will just -- I know you know this, but I'll just acknowledge that the theory with the second payroll support program was to simply extend what was done the first time, which was through September for another 6 months. And the payroll support program in rough dollars was $25 billion, the first time around. Well, it was far less than that here the second time around. And we're staring down another -- in terms of cash flow, $1 billion losing quarter here in the first quarter, just like we had in the fourth quarter with higher fuel prices. 
So this has certainly not ended, and it's anybody's guess what the second quarter will be. So this is all about protecting jobs. And we're the only airline to promise no job losses or pay cuts in 2020. We lived up to that. We promised the same thing again here in 2021. That doesn't mean that we won't have risk and concerns beyond this. So we're not promising this indefinitely. And all airlines are alike. 
So I think the short answer is, it's too early to give you a specific answer, but it's definitely something that I'm glad the administration is looking at. I'm glad that Congress is looking at it. And I'm glad that we'll have a seat at the table here."

And it was actually -- I wouldn't say it was a nonevent for us. We have your fairly underweight there, if you will, compared to OAs, but that wasn't a problem for us. 
With respect to coming into the U.S., it's not clear -- first of all, it's not clear if, when, what, how we'd be asked to do that. But it's certainly something that we're thinking about. If it were something similar to what's being required internationally, how would we do that domestically? And right now, the international is -- it's a pretty manual process because it's sprung upon all of us so quickly, so you got to get the technology and to scale that domestically.
Well, I will say what I think, if that's -- if you don't mind. I think if we're ultimately going to be doing a domestic testing type of -- or type of protocol or regimen. I really don't think you want this being done by airport, by airline, by city, by state. I think, as we say in Texas, that could be a real go rodeo. I mean it's going to be a real challenging thing for customers to navigate all of that if it's not consistent across the country. 
So I think that if we are going to do something, which, by the way, I don't think our government affairs team, our operations team or our customer experience team have really been given any indications coming. We're reading the same things you're reading, the CDC. And we're anticipating hearing something from somebody, but we're thinking about it. They want to figure it out fairly quickly.
So our technology teams and CX teams, customer experience is what CX is, are thinking through how might we do that if it did in fact come to fruition, but nothing known at this point."

By extension, I'm not aware that they've reached out to the Airlines for America. But yes, I think it would be a mistake. It's very costly. 
As Tammy was pointing out in an earlier interview to administer the test, we don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place. Where our emphasis needs to be is on the 2 vaccines that are available and getting them rolled out and getting the country vaccinated. And I would hate for us to take our eye off of that ball. 
But I would just make the argument that why pick on air travel? If you want to test people, test them, but test them before they go to the grocery store. Test them before they go to a restaurant. Test them before they go to a sporting event. 
The -- I think it's been well recognized that the air cabin is extremely clean and healthy and safe. And with the new administration mandating mask in the transportation sector, that's what we need the most, which is hygiene, wearing mask, social distancing, which should now better extend in the airport and beyond. That's the right approach here. 
And I just think with the millions of customers who fly or ride buses or trains or whatever, it's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a large scale."

I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in trying to get access to test through friends and family is extremely difficult. And that's before now you would mandate that you want more test administered. I just think it's wholly impractical. 
And obviously, we -- selfishly, we hope that we don't get to a point where we're prohibited from flying, but that's a different question and something, obviously, that needs to be addressed. But fortunately, at this point, we're not dealing with a significant threat from these different strains."

So we're working through that at this point with our customer experience team and our provisioning team and operations and in-flight team are working through when does it make sense for us to do it? It very well can be sometime in the first quarter. 
I think a lot of it really does have to do though with what we're seeing in terms of case counts. And I just looked at the case counts before coming into the call, and every state, pretty much -- I shouldn't say every, I think there were 1 or 2 that were still going up. Case counts are down, hospitalizations are down, and so on and so forth. And that certainly has a bearing on how we think about it.

The first quarter results are notable. First of all, because they're a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement,",751,"Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 call. The first quarter results are notable. First of all, because they're a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worse than our fourth quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly, that's not sustainable. But fortunately, we're here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter, and we'll give you all a full brief on the first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. 
But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the Federal Government and effectively covering the first quarter It was much needed. We're very grateful. We're the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like. And I'm very, very gratified that our 50-year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. 
Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the 9-month, down 65% flatline that we have been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. 
Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we've had thousands of people on leave. And now that we're adding flights, we're smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to fly 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. But the point being is that we're very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we're very well aware that it will still be messy and we'll have to carefully manage. 
Number four, please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon 2 things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity, and you need to read into that, that means more than what we've been doing prior to March. And number two, we've got to have more customers to fill those flights and obviously, read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed costs for us to be profitable below roughly 3 to 3 -- 3,300 -- 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it's realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. 
So in summary, I'm -- a lot of things here this morning. I'm relieved. I'm optimistic. I'm enthused. I'm grateful and I'm especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees, who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least at this point. We've got a long way to go, but I'm very, very confident that we can all depend upon our Southwest warriors. They are very resilient. 
And then finally, I'm pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I'm glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition of global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities as we're pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we've got a great domestic network. We've got great service. And finally, they're going to have access to low fares. 
The cost and the spending performance has also been excellent, and we're making great progress towards restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then I'm absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator, with all the attendant competitive benefits that, that enables. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our COO, Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that, but among other things. Mike, great job, great performance. So take it away."

And well, we really had an action packed start of the year, and I'm very proud of our people and how they just continue to rise to the occasion. They've opened up 4 new stations in the first quarter and 2 more in April; implement",1057,"Well, thanks a lot, Gary. And well, we really had an action packed start of the year, and I'm very proud of our people and how they just continue to rise to the occasion. They've opened up 4 new stations in the first quarter and 2 more in April; implemented a Federal MAX mandate; returned the MAX to service; secured a new long-term Boeing order book for both the MAX 7 and the MAX 8; and reached service agreements with GE and CFM International for the Leap-1B engines. And all of that while running an exceptional operation. 
So we ended the quarter with an on-time performance of 86.2%. And that was good for third in the industry, and that included a reduction of roughly 4.4 points due to weather. As you know, we've got large operations in Texas and the entire state froze for several days in mid-February, and that impacted our network; as well as a winter storm Xylia, which impacted Denver as we launched into our March-based schedule. So speaking of our March schedule, we returned the MAX to revenue service on March 11. Once we've completed all of the maintenance requirements of the pilot training and we had a [ Felton post set ] of 200-plus readiness flights on the airplane. The launch was limited to 10 lines of flying and the airplanes were separated from the rest of the fleet for the first month of service. On April 12, we increased the lines of flying to 55 lines. And the aircraft are now fully interchangeable across the network. 
We currently have 64 MAX aircraft in the fleet, and we have 32 of those aircraft currently out of service, awaiting FAA approval of repair in structures from Boeing. The repairs will ensure that a sufficient ground path exists for certain components of the electrical power systems. These aircraft were identified by Boeing as part of the specific production run and the impact of MAX lines of flying are being covered by spare aircraft in our next-generation fleet. We're not experiencing any significant operational impact and once we receive FAA approval, it will take 2 to 3 days per aircraft to make the repairs and then with all the aircraft work expected to be complete in roughly 3 weeks. 
So turning back to the first quarter performance, our bag handling continues to produce all-time best company results. We delivered 99.7% of all bags and claim without a mishandled claim. And as you know, we do that carrying more free bags than anyone in the industry. And we continue to lead all marketing carriers with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. 
Perhaps the highlight of the first quarter was securing a new long-term order book with Boeing for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 as well as our agreement with GE and CFM International to maintain the Leap-1B engines. So we announced our order book on March 29, and there are just a couple of items that I'd like to highlight. First, we added 100 firm orders for the MAX 7, which will be the replacement aircraft for our 737-700s. We also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to MAX 7 firm orders, and that brings our firm order book for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 to 200 and 149 aircraft, respectively. We also added 155 options for either MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft, and that brings our total number of options to 270 aircraft. And the interchangeability of the options of -- between aircraft types, that just gives us tremendous flexibility. So when you put all that together, we are maintaining a substantial operational and economic efficiency as a result of a single fleet type and the Leap-1B engine provides at least a 14% better fuel efficiency, quieter engines and has excellent dispatch reliability to support our on-time operation. 
We intend to retire a significant number of our roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and the MAX 7 is best-in-class aircraft for us in that 150-seat category. Just like the MAX 8 is the best-in-class for us in the 175-seat category, The acceleration of our fleet modernization, I think makes great economic sense. It will also reduce carbon emissions and noise levels, which, of course, is better for the environment. And it also provides a superb cabin experience for our customers and our employees. 
Looking forward into the second quarter, we have a couple of important capabilities that we're going to add to the operation. First, we're in the final stages of obtaining ETOPS certification for our MAX 8 fleet. So the MAX and its fuel burn advantages roll out is not only to reduce our operating cost to [ Hawaii ] but it's also going to allow us to fill all 175 seats in winter wind conditions. And that's something that we can't always accomplish with the next-gen fleet. And that was our plan all along, but of course, the efforts were delayed as a result of the MAX grounding. 
Second, we're going to begin a fleet transition to an all-new maintenance recordkeeping system beginning with our 737-700s later this month. And this system replaces our Wizard system, and that system is nearly 30 years old. This new system provides us a foundation for real-time maintenance recordkeeping, paperless records, improved planning, better analytics and automated controls to enhance regulatory compliance. Once we complete the transition of the -700 fleet, then the -800s and the MAX will follow later this year. 
So just in closing, I can certainly feel the operational momentum building, and I have to tell you, it feels good. We are in the process of bringing our entire fleet back into an operational status. We're coordinating our staffing to ensure that we're resourced to fly at whatever our desired levels are. And we're introducing new capabilities and navigating through an environment that continues to be impacted by COVID. And our people are just magnificent. I can't say enough about them. They do all of these things. They still run a great operation, and it's amongst the best we've ever delivered. And they're just the best team that I've ever been associated with and my deepest thanks to each and every one of them. 
And so with that, President Nealon, over to you."
31726,694554724,2255701,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I'm going to try not to repeat what you've",3506,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I'm going to try not to repeat what you've already heard. But I do want to provide some color regarding first quarter's revenue performance as well as some perspective on near-term trends and our outlook for the second quarter. 
So as you know, the first quarter, operating revenues decreased [ to 2% ] year-over-year, we're down 60% compared with the first quarter of 2019, and this is better than we were expecting 3 months ago when we last spoke with you during the January call. Annual operating revenues ended up about 5 points better, in March about 15 points better than our estimates in that same time. And that has really been the story over the past few months. We have seen steady and very encouraging improvements in leisure travel demand and bookings week after week, really since about mid-February. We saw a very nice improvement in March with operating revenues down 10% year-over-year and down 54% compared with March of 2019, which again was better than our guidance range of down 55% to 60%. March load factor was 73%, also better than guidance, and passenger yield was down 34% year-over-year. Yields were down quite a bit for the months -- for the month once we got into March. But once we got into March, rather, fares improved each week as we saw demand steadily increase. Close-end bookings held up well. We also began to see the booking curve extend further out. Keeping in mind that business travel remained fairly stagnant, which I'll hit on in just a few minutes, I'd say that we were really very pleased with March's overall performance. We're able to get a very good base of bookings in place for March earlier in the booking curve, and we did this through very targeted promotions that we ran back in December, January and February time frame. And once we got into March, our revenue management team was able to do a really nice job of managing our inventory close rate of managing yields. 
And as expected, Spring break performed really nicely, very well. It's bigger than just the spring break story. The entire month of March really saw a steady build in passenger traffic. And just to give some perspective, March's load factor was 20 points higher than what we experienced in January, and that was actually on higher capacity as well, which I think really highlights the pent-up demand for leisure travel that we're seeing. And what's encouraging is that this momentum continues into April and in our last investor update that was in mid-March, we estimated April operating revenues to decline 45% to 55% versus 2019. But since that update, we've experienced steady improving passenger volumes and fares. So we're now estimating April operating revenues to decline in the 40% to 45% range versus 2019, and that's with a load factor between 75% and 80%. 
Now the Easter Holiday weekend at the beginning of the month performed very well as we expected, and leisure traffic and bookings for the remainder of April hasn't slowed down a bit. In our earnings release, we gave our first estimate for May revenues, which shows further improvement in comparison with April's outlook. We estimate May operating revenues to decline in the 35% to 40% range versus 2019, with a load factor in the 75% to 80% range. And as we experienced in April, May holiday and nonholiday time periods are both looking very well in terms of our leisure demand. And with these improving demand trends holding their patterns since mid-February, it really has provided us a much better opportunity to manage the booking curve for April, May and beyond. Our revenue guidance for April and May includes the expectation of sequentially improving load factors and also improving passenger yields when compared with March. We expect the yields will still be down compared to 2019 levels, but that should be fairly intuitive, given that we are almost solely reliant on leisure travelers at this point in the recovery. Now that being said, though, we have been pleased how well close the demand performed in March and is trending so far for April. 
At this point, we aren't quite great to provide an outlook for June, but I will say that we're seeing bookings increase further out in the booking curve and they're building faster. Now it's still pretty early in the curve for June and July, but I will tell you that bookings are building nicely at this point and shaping up seasonally as you expect for leisure travel. So in a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May; roughly 35% or so booked for June; and around 20% booked for July, and we are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings. 
Now with June being one of our highest demand summer months, our current expectation would be for June's revenue performance to be better than May relative to 2019, but we'll provide you with the June revenue outlook as part of our investor update in mid-May. Now as vaccination counts rise, the travel restrictions ease and leisure demand increases, we are obviously pretty encouraged. It feels good, and there's a feeling of optimism. But as you know, the improvement -- the improvements rather skew heavily towards leisure demand now into the summer and simply too early to make much of a prediction on travel demand for the fall. And we are very mindful of the fact that the demand recovery may not be a strength and quick path back to prepandemic levels. 
Which brings us to business travel. Our corporate managed travel revenues were down 88% in the first quarter versus Q1 of '19, which is consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 results. However, we did see some modest improvement later in the quarter, in particular in March, where corporate revenues were down 85% versus March 2019. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from our corporate customers, continues to be very clear that domestic business travel will certainly continue to significantly lag leisure recovery. And for now, we are planning for a scenario where business travel will still be down 50% to 60% by the end of this year. 
Now having said that, we are, in fact, seeing more and more of our customers beginning to allow their employees to get off the bench and fly and travel and they're beginning to unfreeze or relax or travel policies. But although that's happening, we just aren't seeing the volumes come back at this point. Now if you buy into surveys, and I guess I swore to buy into the surveys, the most recent [ TVTA Business Travel Survey ] suggested that roughly 60% of respondents expect to resume domestic business travel in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I guess we'll see. Time will tell in terms of the pace of business travel recovery. And it's also not clear, to be honest with you, what percent of traditional business travel ultimately returns. Our view is that there could be a 10% to 20% reduction in business travel, either permanently or at least for some extended period of time. 
But having said all that, however, the business demand curve shapes back up. I can tell you, as Gary alluded to just a moment ago, that we are really well positioned. In fact, this is the best positioning we've already had in terms of going after corporate business travel. You're all very aware of the GDS initiatives. I'm not going to go on about that, but it closes a huge gap in our corporate travel capabilities. As you guys know, we are live on Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan today. And we are very far down the path to implement the Sabre GDS platform in the coming months, and we have a targeted go-live date that we will implement prior to Labor Day. So really good progress on this front, and the teams are doing an incredible job. So we're feeling very good about where we are. Our sales teams are out in the market. We are engaging with our customers at a very high level and very frequent level. And the response has been incredible. So I think we are really well positioned to gain some revenue and perhaps will be a share. 
Shifting gears to regional demand, I just want to give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing in terms of the different parts of the network. In general, our leisure markets where restrictions have remained low continue to outperform the rest of the system, very nicely, beaches, mountains, sun and ski are all performing very well, which is totally consistent with what you're hearing from the other carriers as well. A little more specifically to our network. We are seeing strength in our Texas markets, Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. We're also seeing strength in really all of Florida, but in particular, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which includes Panama City, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Tampa. The Desert Mountain region is performing really nicely, which includes Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise, Denver is also performing very well. So there's a lot of strength within the network. Demand continues to lag in areas such as the Northeast, Chicago is lagging a bit. California is lagging a bit, although it's really improving since the restrictions are being lifted. So we are seeing improvements across the system, which is encouraging. And honestly, whether a city has been lagging or outperforming, what we are seeing is that all markets have improved fairly significantly recently compared to where they were in January and February. 
So as a result of what you just heard, we are comfortable adding back flights to capture additional demand, including Hawaii. And it's great to see demand from California to Hawaii as well as between the islands, ramp back up. And we're finally at a point where we can get to our Hawaii flight schedules up to where we'd hopefully be a year ago before the pandemic. As you know, international testing remains in place. Overall, I'd say our international demand is performing just fine, not a lot to report. At this point, we are only serving 8 of our 14 international stations, and we'll intend to bring the remaining 6 back online as it makes sense and as restrictions ease. 
A little color and perspective on new stations. At this point, we have opened 10 or announced 17 new airports and all of them are performing terrific. In fact, there's not a clump in the bunch. All of them are generating new customers, additional revenue in collectively are contributing positively to our cash performance. We feel really good about what we are seeing in our first hand. And more to come. So we'll begin service in Fresno on April 25; [ Destin Fort Walton ] Beach on May 6; Myrtle Beach on the 23rd of May; [ both in Montana ] on the 27th; Jackson, Mississippi on June 6. And we also just announced last week [ Gin, Oregon ] will begin service at August 29, and we will begin service in Bellingham, Washington later this year. So all the new stations that are operating today are meeting or exceeding our expectations. They've done our rate of for years, and it's great to see them open operational. And honestly, it's kind of -- it's pretty interesting. I think our network planning team is batting 1,000%. So this is really something and the operations are starting up really cleanly. 
In terms of our capacity for the first quarter, capacity decreased 35% year-over-year. It was down 39% compared with the first quarter of 2019, which was consistent with our expectations. And as planned, we added, as Gary alluded to, we add additional capacity in March, which equated to roughly 1,000 flights each day beginning mid-month. And that really paid off as demand improved. And these incremental flights improved our March performance by roughly $150 million -- that's revenue performance by $150 million. Our April capacity is expected to decline 24% and May capacity is expected to decline 18% relative to 2019 levels. Now this includes a modest increase in flying in April and about 3 points of incremental capacity in May compared with our previous guidance, which is really just the result of a stronger demand outlook. At this point, we are in the process of adjusting our June flight schedules. And once the revisions are complete, we expect June ASMs to decline 4% versus 2019. 
And as you've seen throughout the pandemic, actually, we've cut more business-oriented short-haul flying and adding more leisure-oriented longer-haul flying as well as work linking itineraries. which is driving higher capacity with newer aircraft, and this makes up roughly 4 to 5 points of the 14-point sequential capacity increase from May to June. And assuming the current trends continue, our preliminary plans for July call for similar levels of capacity as June relative to 2019 levels, and we'll be finalizing our July plans here very shortly. 
So in terms of passenger revenue and capacity, our focus remains on managing the next few months with as much precision as possible, which is what we've been doing throughout the year and improving our revenue performance as well as improving our cash burn performance toward breaking even or better with an emphasis on or better. That's our goal. 
In terms of other revenues, our other revenues performed better than passenger revenue in the first quarter and was down 15% year-over-year. For March, though, our other revenue was actually up 3% year-over-year. Our ancillary products specifically commissions from car, hotel and vacation bookings performed about in line with passenger revenue, no surprise there. But the mega contributor to our other revenue performance was our Rapid Rewards program. And the first quarter total revenue from our loyalty program was down 19% year-over-year or 22% versus 2019. When you look at it at just the royalty revenue that flows through Other revenue, revenue was down 12% versus 2019. This is a very strong performance, especially relative to passenger revenues. And I think it just speaks very clearly to the strength of the program as a whole and the high level of engagement that we have with our customers and they, with us. The sequential improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by increases in retail sales and commissions on new card acquisitions. 
Total co-brand card spend in March was only down 1% versus March of 2019 and for the first time since the pandemic began, our credit card portfolio size grew in the first quarter, again relative to 2019. So we're thrilled to see that. So our credit card portfolio remains very strong. We're seeing the average spend per cardholder continue to improve. Attrition continues to be very, very low, and we are really very pleased with the performance of our program. And I think you can see in our results that we have more rapid rewards members, more credit card holders and more engagement from our customers. And now we have more places for them to go, with a lot more leisure destinations. 
And building on that, our brand remains very strong. Our brand NPS scores continued to rank at the very top of the industry, which is something that we focus on and watch a lot, we watch very closely. Our Trip NPS, which measures individual flight experiences, is trending even higher right now as well, which speaks to our people's focus on hospitality and producing great on-time performance So as Mike said, and I am so grateful with our frontline employees. They execute every day with precision and grace and I'm thankful for that. 
And finally, I do want to share a few comments in our perspective regarding our focus on the environment, which seems appropriate since today is Earth Day. Now Gary has already shared our long-term goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, which is aligned with [ ARA's goal as an ] industry. And this isn't a new topic for us, though this is something that we've been focused on for a long time. Our focus has certainly intensified over the past year. But just for perspective, since 2002, we've invested more than $620 million in fuel efficiency initiatives, and that's independent of new aircraft. And in 2019, we saved more than 7 million gallons of fuel through flight planning initiatives. So this is something that, again, is not new to us. And as Mike discussed earlier, we plan retiring a significant number about roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and we'll be investing billions of dollars on new aircraft that are 14% more fuel efficient. And as it stands today, the carbon emissions that we generate on a per ASM basis is among the very best in the industry, and our fleet modernization program gives us a massive opportunity to continue to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. 
So that's all great. We also know that fleet by alone isn't nearly enough to get us to our goal of carbon neutral by 2050. In our views of the most promising path over the next 10 to 15 years is a combination of fleet modernization, operational fuel efficiency initiatives, air traffic control modernization and the introduction of economically viable, sustainable aviation fuels or SAF at scale. Today, we have a SAF offtake agreement in place with Red Rock Biofuels, and our teams continue to work with the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL on the development of new SAF feedstocks and pathways. We've also recently signed MOUs with both Marathon Petroleum and [ Phillips 66 ] to accelerate the production of SAF, with the objective of achieving affordable SAF with low carbon intensity scores at scale. And the crux of the agreement is to work together toward the production of 300 million gallons of SAF in the 2025 time frame. This is a very ambitious target, and there's a tremendous amount of work to be done, but it's also a really important step forward. And we intend to work very closely with both Marathon and Phillips 66 throughout the process, with the intent to secure large offtake agreements that represent a significant share of the SAF that's produced. 
But to be honest, this effort is not just about Southwest securing more SAF for Southwest. It's also about getting large energy producers into the market, getting production to scale at affordable prices. We also believe that the use of carbon offsets can be appropriate and helpful, but we see this as a bridging technique. Our use of offset so far has been focused on renewable energy credits, which are natural gas offsets to complete our headquartered campus 100% renewable energy plan. And up to this point, we have not been using carbon offsets. But if used appropriately again, they can't be helpful where it's making offsets available to customers or corporations who are looking to offset their travel emissions. So more to come on this, but again, we see offsets as a bridging solution. 
Direct air capture, new airframe and engine technologies and new energy sources such as hydrogen, power liquid or PTL also have tremendous promise, but we see these things as being much further out, call it, 2035 and beyond. And our objective is to focus on things that we feel like we can have a real impact on over the next 10 to 15 years. So this is something that we are absolutely committed to achieving. But to be really clear, the industry is going to have to work together. No single airline can do it alone. It's just impossible. So it's going to take a lot of work with a variety of organizations, including the private sector and nonprofits as well as strong support and policy from the federal government and state governments. And we'll need innovation and scale in the energy industry. And will also meet continued advancements for the aerospace industry to become carbon neutral by 2050. 
Now Gary has asked me to be the executive sponsor for our environmental efforts, and I've asked [ Stacy Melfers ], our Vice President of Supply Chain, who is extremely knowledgeable of SAF in end-to-end fuel supply chain to take this on with me as well. So to wrap it up, we'll be providing a comprehensive report of what we are doing and the progress we're making in our annual sustainability report, which we call the [ Southwest One Report ], and we'll be publishing this online to our investor site in the coming weeks. 
So with that, Tammy, I'm going to hand it over to you."

Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first quarter net incom",2123,"All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. 
This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning's press release, our first quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending. 
Excluding special items, our first quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year-over-year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. 
We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. 
Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parts. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we'll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. However, we currently estimate our second quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter's ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per aircraft basis, each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress towards our long-term environmental goals. 
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first quarter operating cost decreased 19% year-over-year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. 
In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first quarter advertising spend was down 8% year-over-year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. 
Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary extended emergency time-off program. In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense, sequential cost increases from a few items account for about 1/3 of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work. Partially offsetting our second quarter cost pressure from these 3 costs is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. 
Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other 2/3 of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. 
While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. 
Our first quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don't currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the team at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable CapEx. 
We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8. For second quarter, we expect to receive 7 MAX 8 deliveries and retire 3 737-700s. And we will have 1 more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to 6 more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 CapEx. That said, we are well positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover the majority of our fleet modernization plans, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. 
As expected, our first quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft CapEx and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage CapEx with our order book with aircraft CapEx on firm orders of $700 million next year. 
Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support are $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. 
Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. 
In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren't out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work towards breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. 
I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come. With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions."

And I'll let Tammy add if she wants to. I just think it's premature to telegraph what our thoughts might be ultimately in terms of shareholder returns. I'm not a fan of special dividends. I don't mind sharing that. So I also don't mind sharing that I haven't had that thought that we would be doing a special dividend, and we couldn't do it until post September 23 or 2023 anyway. But it's -- we've got 4 phases, I don't know, that we're thinking of. One is survival; second is stabilize; third would be repair; and then fourthly, would be back to prosperity. So we've sort of declared that until we stop losing money, we're still in the survival mode. that's a roll out there for what we're thinking. Once we get to prosperity, I'd love for us to get back to handsome shareholder returns, and I just feel like we need to prepare the balance sheet first. 
I got the question this morning on CNBC, and I thought it was a good one. We view share repurchases as you well know. We had a healthy dividend going into pandemic, as you will. Now we also had the strongest balance sheet and the lowest leverage in our history coming into 2020 and all of that is key in terms of thinking in the future about what we would do with shareholder return. So we've got to get our balance sheet back in order. It's not broken, but we do have some work to do. And that's -- I know we're all aligned here that that's our top priority."

It's hard for me to argue that Southwest would need any further support. 
Now the premise that you raised, of course, is that if I could sort of extrapolate that isn't achieved and we sort of bump along -- with my comments initially, yes, our first quarter turned out better than we thought it would be, but we still lost $1 billion. Well, that can't go on indefinitely for any company and certainly for an airline. So I don't think that that's what we're staring down. I don't think we're looking at $1 billion loss second, third, fourth quarter. So given that, I -- which is the only way I can really answer the question, I don't think we're in that scenario. So therefore, no, because this is a live question on this infrastructure bill. And then finally, no, we're not advocating for anything different other than just trying to provide our input on the spending and the investments that are being contemplated in that bill, along with the prospect of corporate tax increases.

So the -- let me just talk about the business travel for just a second. So the industries that are starting to pop back up again, I consider business demand is falling as opposed to leisure demand, which is hot. But the areas of the business demand that are starting to travel, it's a lot of government DoD. It is manufacturing, some transportation, the areas that are not traveling are the big consulting firms, which by the way, are the biggest consumers we have of their travel. So that's what's really not happening yet. 
I think that in terms of the conversations with the large accounts at this point, given that we are now on the GDS platforms, we're talking about this before, we're starting to see the channel shift that we expect to see, given that we're now on 4 GDS platforms and I guess the honest answer is the volumes are so low. It's just hard to know if we're seeing what we would have expected to see in terms of channel shift from one to the other. We are seeing a little bit of a shift. I think, Andrew jump in, if I'm not correct here, is a little bit of shift from the Sabre BBR basic product into more of the standard GDS platform. So that's working well. 
But I guess just in general, the commentary we, our teams, talk with, in fact, they did a great piece with Hunter. I'm not sure if you guys read it. Took a while to read it, it's pretty long but it was really good. But the conversation was really such that the customer really gets our products. They really want the product. We've just been so hard to do business with, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the conversations with our large corporates are really very, very positive and they wanted to be on the shelf in Sabre and the others, and we will be. So we have seen a follow business travel, I think."

And so all I've been saying is really in response, Mike, to a question about will business travel ever recover. And I think it will. I think it's silly to sit here and say it will never recover. I mean that's a bold statement. But Mike, it could be a long time. And that's where I've thrown out the 10 years, and I've done that consistently. You know that a typical recessionary recovery is 5 years for business travel. And we've lived through a lot of recessions together. So that, I feel confident of. What I'm not confident about is whether this is a typical recession, number one, and it's got some pluses compared to a typical. It has the negative because of everything that we know about being able to work now with technology virtually and remotely. And that is a huge question mark. 
I'm on another Board besides Southwest, talk to other CEOs, talk to all my friends and colleagues here at Southwest and we get plenty of anecdotal information that suggests that business travel will not recover to prepandemic levels anytime soon. So there's just no way to know. So no, I'm not predicting it's 10 years. Really, what I was trying to do is sort of tamp down the argument that it will never recover and just simply to say that, who knows? It could be a long recovery time period, but we're going to be prepared, Mike, regardless. And so Tom and Andrew were just talking about GDS. And for Southwest, I think that we will recover business travel faster because we have a new avenue to gain business travelers. And we dramatically under-indexed the managed travel market. And that was because we weren't a part of the GDS. We remedied that. We're the largest airline in the United States. By virtue of that, I would argue that we're the largest business airline in the United States. And as I said in my remarks, now the managed travel accounts will have wide access to a great network, great service, no bag fees, no change fees and low fares. They will finally have access to low fares. I think we will do extremely well there."

And now all of a sudden, the deluge of cities, and some of these are actually small markets. And if I think back to Southwest in the past, some small markets, the company historically may have struggled. What it sounds like the ramp-up is going fairly well. Andrew, maybe what has changed that you feel much stronger in moving into some of these smaller markets and more quickly? Maybe it's just the pandemic, you strike when the iron is hot, maybe it's the density of the Southwest network, small cities can plug in and you can turn on and be successful far easier today than the Southwest of 10 years ago? Maybe I answered the question, but if you could just give us some color because this is kind of a different mode for Southwest with respect to new city development."

We are methodical. And so prior to the pandemic, we have a practice every year of going through and looking at every place we could fly our aircraft and evaluating them at least in desktop, if not in-person visit. So all these cities were ones that were known to us and evaluated prior to the pandemic. And so when the pandemic, as Gary talked about, we're unsure about the pace of business travel return. And so because we have a lot of business travelers, if they were not to return in a timely manner, we would have a shortfall in revenue activity to deploy our people and assets against, and with the operating leverage model, you don't want that. So we want to make sure we have enough new cities to cover any potential shortfall in that return. So that led us to go at a bigger scale than normal. 
The cities we chose, we chose also to have a low risk as far as our maturation. And we've been in plenty of small cities for a long time. So a lot of Western Texas cities and Pac Northwest cities, they're modest, and we do quite well, Upstate New York. And the key is the small city that is relevant to a place where we have a large customer base. And so if you look at all these small cities, they're either in marquee destinations under themselves or they're relevant to a nearby large Southwest city, where we have a large customer base who would be big purchasers of tickets through small cities. And so that's what's important to us. And then we want to make sure we go in with at least a level of flight activity that allows for crew efficiencies so that we have origination and terminators that make us not to have crude deadhead that would undermine inefficiency. So all those things must come together for us to add those new cities. So I think prepared and it fits with our model, I think, is the answer."

If we kind of reconcile to 1992 when you work on our secondary offering in those states, if you remember our rule of thumb, but it's -- we didn't want to go into a city in the early 1990s unless we thought we could do, let's say, 8 departures a day. And so I wouldn't translate what we're doing with these 17 cities as being a violation of even that old rule of thumb, because some of these ""small cities,"" I think, Andrew -- I won't name names because we may not want to telegraph yet, but there are a handful that I can think of that you might think are small. We're thinking there are going to be a dozen or more daily departures into a number of nonstop destinations. So you can make the fact that we now have such a large U.S. presence, it makes a lot of these smaller markets much more viable today in terms of flight activity than it did 30 years ago. 
But the other thing I would point out is that Miami isn't small. Bush isn't small. Commonwealth Spring isn't. [ O'Haire ] is not small. So we do have a few cities that have 3 or 4 daily departures on the route map. And I would -- Mike would call those small. And we have experience with them, and we know that they can work. I don't think that, that means that every city like that would work. But anyway, it's -- we have been delighted that we could actually have the capacity to put them on the route network here. I got asked earlier today about whether we'll continue this. And I think Andrew is going to need -- assuming that we continue on our recovery path, he's going to need to take a lot of these airplanes and put them back into restoring flight activity into our existing network. So that will challenge our ability to continue doing this play, but they're permanent adds and we're delighted with the performance that we're seeing."

But as I talk about the business demand thawing. as it begins to thaw, we're going to need to begin to get our network back in business travel shape. And just to give you a little view, I guess people are asking ask us, so what does the -- so when does the network get back to normal? Well, the network is not going to get back to what it was because we had 17 new cities on the network. But what I can tell you is when you think about the principles in the characteristics of the Southwest network, those will be intact. Point-to-point, you should expect to see a very similar mix as short medium log a similar mix of direct and connecting traffic. And our focus, once we begin to see business on though is we got to begin to put the depth back into the markets like the St. Louis and Milwaukee's and [ intra Cal ] business markets and such. 
So it's going to be an interesting -- but that's also why we're getting more aircraft. So we're going to retire some are going to have some incrementals. So it's going to take time which is fine because business traffic is not going to show up on one Sunday and all of a sudden it's back. It's going to take time, and we'll begin to build our fleet back in our network depth back. You spurred a lively topic their Linenberg. So thank you."

We know how to manage growth, and we would be foolish to pass on what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime to grow this airline in this environment. We are so well positioned.

I think the business demand side is starting to thaw. But I literally have right in front of me what our -- what the booking curve and the fair curve looks like for the upcoming months. And they're pretty solid, and they're really encouraging. So barring a trend ship, I feel pretty good about where we are, and it's kind of back to what we said in the call. Barring a trend change, we feel good about the opportunity to break even, perhaps you can make a little bit of a profit sometime in June or beyond. So I think that's kind of how I'd answer at this point. As the booking curve begins to get more extended out further out, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we manage the inventories and the fares and it's starting to take a normal booking distribution shape, if you will, the level is too low, but the shape is normal. So we're able to manage our pricing more effectively, and that's kind of where we are. So we feel good barring a trend change."

If it increases, we have ability to recall people on EXCO and if it really explodes, we have the ability to go hire people.

And of course, you pick a point in time and you can judge that number around. But that just gives you some sense. And what Tom was talking about was flying our June schedule at 96% of what we were prepandemic for June. We've had a little bit of attrition. We've had a voluntary separation program, and that's what gets us down from 100% down to this 92% level. So we are comfortable -- we're overstaffed right now in March, April. Projecting forward to June, we would be right at the proper staffing, if not a little bit short. So there's pluses and minuses. One department might be a little over, one department might be a little under. But I think beyond -- to Mike's point, beyond June, I think what we're all anxious to see is, well, what do things look like when we get to June. Are we going to hit our forecast as we've anticipated it with the bookings for July, August, September look as good as we hoped. Is there pent-up demand that is not sustained beyond that. I mean there's just a number of good questions that can be posed at this point. So it's just a little bit premature.

The first quarter results are notable, first of all, because they're a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement,",752,"Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 call. The first quarter results are notable, first of all, because they're a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worse than our fourth quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly, that's not sustainable. But fortunately, we're here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter, and we'll give you all a full brief on the first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. 
But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the Federal Government and -- effectively covering the first quarter. It was much needed. We're very grateful. We're the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like. And I'm very, very gratified that our 50-year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. 
Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the 9-month, down 65% flatline that we have been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. 
Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we've had thousands of people on leave. And now that we're adding flights, we're smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to fly 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. But the point being is that we're very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we're very well aware that it will still be messy and we'll have to carefully manage. 
Number four, please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon 2 things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity, and you need to read into that, that means more than what we've been doing prior to March. And number two, we've got to have more customers to fill those flights and obviously, read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed costs for us to be profitable below roughly 3 to 3 -- 3,300 -- 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it's realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. 
So in summary, I'm -- a lot of things here this morning. I'm relieved. I'm optimistic. I'm enthused. I'm grateful and I'm especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least at this point. We've got a long way to go, but I'm very, very confident that we can all depend upon our Southwest warriors. They are very resilient. 
And then finally, I'm pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I'm glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition of global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities as we're pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we've got a great domestic network. We've got great service. And finally, they're going to have access to low fares. 
The cost and the spending performance has also been excellent, and we're making great progress towards restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then I'm absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator, with all the attendant competitive benefits that, that enables. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our COO, Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that, but among other things. Mike, great job, great performance. So take it away."

They've opened up 4 new stations in the first quarter and 2 more in April; implemented a Federal MAX mandate; returned the MAX to service; secured a new long-term Boeing order book for both the MAX 7 and the MAX 8; and reached service agreements with GE and CFM International for the Leap-1B engines. And all of that while running an exceptional operation. 
So we ended the quarter with an on-time performance of 86.2%. And that was good for a third in the industry, and that included a reduction of roughly 4.4 points due to weather. As you know, we've got large operations in Texas and the entire state froze for several days in mid-February, and that impacted our network; as well as a winter storm Xylia, which impacted Denver as we launched into our March-based schedule. So speaking of our March schedule, we returned the MAX to revenue service on March 11. Once we've completed all of the maintenance requirements, the pilot training and we had a filled-in post set of 200-plus readiness flights on the airplane. The launch was limited to 10 lines of flying and the airplanes were separated from the rest of the fleet for the first month of service. On April 12, we increased the lines of flying to 55 lines. And the aircraft are now fully interchangeable across the network. 
We currently have 64 MAX aircraft in the fleet, and we have 32 of those aircraft currently out of service, awaiting FAA approval of repair instructions from Boeing. The repairs will ensure that a sufficient ground path exists for certain components of the electrical power systems. These aircraft were identified by Boeing as part of the specific production run and the impact of MAX lines of flying are being covered by spare aircraft in our next-generation fleet. We're not experiencing any significant operational impact and once we receive FAA approval, it will take 2 to 3 days per aircraft to make the repairs and then -- with all the aircraft work expected to be complete in roughly 3 weeks. 
So turning back to the first quarter performance, our bag handling continues to produce all-time best company results. We delivered 99.7% of all bags and claims without a mishandled claim. And as you know, we do that carrying more free bags than anyone in the industry. And we continue to lead all marketing carriers with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. 
Perhaps the highlight of the first quarter was securing a new long-term order book with Boeing for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 as well as our agreement with GE and CFM International to maintain the Leap-1B engines. So we announced our order book on March 29, and there are just a couple of items that I'd like to highlight. First, we added 100 firm orders for the MAX 7, which will be the replacement aircraft for our 737-700s. We also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to MAX 7 firm orders, and that brings our firm order book for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 to 200 and 149 aircraft, respectively. We also added 155 options for either MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft, and that brings our total number of options to 270 aircraft. And the interchangeability of the options of -- between aircraft types, that just gives us tremendous flexibility. So when you put all that together, we are maintaining a substantial operational and economic efficiency as a result of a single fleet type and the Leap-1B engine provides at least a 14% better fuel efficiency, quieter engines and has excellent dispatch reliability to support our on-time operation. 
We intend to retire a significant number of our roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and the MAX 7 is best-in-class aircraft for us in that 150-seat category, just like the MAX 8 is the best-in-class for us in the 175-seat category. The acceleration of our fleet modernization, I think makes great economic sense. It will also reduce carbon emissions and noise levels, which, of course, is better for the environment. And it also provides a superb cabin experience for our customers and our employees. 
Looking forward into the second quarter, we have a couple of important capabilities that we're going to add to the operation. First, we're in the final stages of obtaining ETOPS certification for our MAX 8 fleet. So the MAX and its fuel burn advantages roll out is not only to reduce our operating cost to Hawaii but it's also going to allow us to fill all 175 seats in winter wind conditions. And that's something that we can't always accomplish with the next-gen fleet. And that was our plan all along, but of course, the efforts were delayed as a result of the MAX grounding. 
Second, we're going to begin a fleet transition to an all-new maintenance recordkeeping system beginning with our 737-700s later this month. And this system replaces our Wizard system, and that system is nearly 30 years old. This new system provides us a foundation for real-time maintenance recordkeeping, paperless records, improved planning, better analytics and automated controls to enhance regulatory compliance. Once we complete the transition of the -700 fleet, then the -800s and the MAX will follow later this year. 
So just in closing, I can certainly feel the operational momentum building, and I have to tell you, it feels good. We are in the process of bringing our entire fleet back into an operational status. We're coordinating our staffing to ensure that we're resourced to fly at whatever our desired levels are. And we're introducing new capabilities and navigating through an environment that continues to be impacted by COVID. And our people are just magnificent. I can't say enough about them. They do all of these things. They still run a great operation, and it's amongst the best we've ever delivered. And they're just the best team that I've ever been associated with and my deepest thanks to each and every one of them. 
And so with that, President Nealon, over to you."

Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I'm going to try not to repeat what you've",3483,"Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I'm going to try not to repeat what you've already heard. But I do want to provide some color regarding first quarter's revenue performance as well as some perspective on near-term trends and our outlook for the second quarter. 
So as you know, the first quarter, operating revenues decreased 52% year-over-year, we're down 60% compared with the first quarter of 2019, and this is better than we were expecting 3 months ago when we last spoke with you during the January call. Annual operating revenues ended up about 5 points better, in March about 15 points better than our estimates in that same time. And that has really been the story over the past few months. We have seen steady and very encouraging improvements in leisure travel demand and bookings week after week, really since about mid-February. We saw a very nice improvement in March with operating revenues down 10% year-over-year and down 54% compared with March of 2019, which again was better than our guidance range of down 55% to 60%. March load factor was 73%, also better than guidance, and passenger yield was down 34% year-over-year. 
Yields were down quite a bit for the months -- for the month once we got into March. But once we got into March, rather, fares improved each week as we saw demand steadily increase. Close-end bookings held up well. We also began to see the booking curve extend further out. Keeping in mind that business travel remained fairly stagnant, which I'll hit on in just a few minutes, I'd say that we were really very pleased with March's overall performance. We're able to get a very good base of bookings in place for March earlier in the booking curve, and we did this through very targeted promotions that we ran back in December, January and February time frame. And once we got into March, our revenue management team was able to do a really nice job of managing our inventory close rate of managing yields. 
And as expected, spring break performed really nicely, very well. It's bigger than just the spring break story. The entire month of March really saw a steady build in passenger traffic. And just to give some perspective, March's load factor was 20 points higher than what we experienced in January, and that was actually on higher capacity as well, which I think really highlights the pent-up demand for leisure travel that we're seeing. And what's encouraging is that this momentum continues into April and in our last investor update that was in mid-March, we estimated April operating revenues to decline 45% to 55% versus 2019. But since that update, we've experienced steady improving passenger volumes and fares. So we're now estimating April operating revenues to decline in the 40% to 45% range versus 2019, and that's with a load factor between 75% and 80%. 
Now the Easter Holiday weekend at the beginning of the month performed very well as we expected, and leisure traffic and bookings for the remainder of April hasn't slowed down a bit. In our earnings release, we gave our first estimate for May revenues, which shows further improvement in comparison with April's outlook. We estimate May operating revenues to decline in the 35% to 40% range versus 2019, with a load factor in the 75% to 80% range. And as we experienced in April, May holiday and nonholiday time periods are both looking very well in terms of our leisure demand. And with these improving demand trends holding their patterns since mid-February, it really has provided us a much better opportunity to manage the booking curve for April, May and beyond. 
Our revenue guidance for April and May includes the expectation of sequentially improving load factors and also improving passenger yields when compared with March. We expect the yields will still be down compared to 2019 levels, but that should be fairly intuitive, given that we are almost solely reliant on leisure travelers at this point in the recovery. Now that being said, though, we have been pleased how well-closed the demand performed in March and is trending so far for April. 
At this point, we aren't quite great to provide an outlook for June, but I will say that we're seeing bookings increase further out in the booking curve and they're building faster. Now it's still pretty early in the curve for June and July, but I will tell you that bookings are building nicely at this point and shaping up seasonally as you expect for leisure travel. So in a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May; roughly 35% or so booked for June; and around 20% booked for July, and we are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings. 
Now with June being one of our highest demand summer months, our current expectation would be for June's revenue performance to be better than May relative to 2019, but we'll provide you with the June revenue outlook as part of our investor update in mid-May. Now as vaccination counts rise, the travel restrictions ease and leisure demand increases, we are obviously pretty encouraged. It feels good, and there's a feeling of optimism. But as you know, the improvement -- the improvements rather skew heavily towards leisure demand now into the summer and simply too early to make much of a prediction on travel demand for the fall. And we are very mindful of the fact that the demand recovery may not be a strength and quick path back to prepandemic levels. 
Which brings us to business travel. Our corporate managed travel. Revenues were down 88% in the first quarter versus Q1 of '19, which is consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 results. However, we did see some modest improvement later in the quarter, in particular in March, where corporate revenues were down 85% versus March 2019. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from our corporate customers, it continues to be very clear that domestic business travel will certainly continue to significantly lag leisure recovery. And for now, we are planning for a scenario where business travel will still be down 50% to 60% by the end of this year. 
Now having said that, we are, in fact, seeing more and more of our customers beginning to allow their employees to get off the bench and fly and travel and they're beginning to unfreeze or relax travel policies. But although that's happening, we just aren't seeing the volumes come back at this point. Now if you buy into surveys, and I guess I swore to buy into  surveys, the most recent  TBTA Business Travel Survey suggested that roughly 60% of respondents expect to resume domestic business travel in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I guess we'll see. Time will tell in terms of the pace of business travel recovery. And it's also not clear, to be honest with you, what percent of traditional business travel ultimately returns. Our view is that there could be a 10% to 20% reduction in business travel, either permanently or at least for some extended period of time. 
But having said all that, however, the business demand curve shapes back up. I can tell you, as Gary alluded to just a moment ago, that we are really well positioned. In fact, this is the best positioning we've already had in terms of going after corporate business travel. You're all very aware of the GDS initiatives. I'm not going to go on about that, but it closes a huge gap in our corporate travel capabilities. As you guys know, we are live on Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan today. And we are very far down the path to implement the Sabre GDS platform in the coming months, and we have a targeted go-live date that we will implement prior to Labor Day. So really good progress on this front, and the teams are doing an incredible job. So we're feeling very good about where we are. Our sales teams are out in the market. We are engaging with our customers at a very high level and very frequent level. And the response has been incredible. So I think we are really well positioned to gain some revenue and perhaps even share. 
Shifting gears to regional demand, I just want to give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing in terms of the different parts of the network. In general, our leisure markets where restrictions have remained low continue to outperform the rest of the system, very nicely, beaches, mountains, sun and ski are all performing very well, which is totally consistent with what you're hearing from the other carriers as well. A little more specifically to our network. We are seeing strength in our Texas markets, Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. We're also seeing strength in really all of Florida, but in particular, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which includes Panama City, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Tampa. 
The Desert Mountain region is performing really nicely, which includes Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise, Denver is also performing very well. So there's a lot of strength within the network. Demand continues to lag in areas such as the Northeast, Chicago is lagging a bit. California is lagging a bit, although it's really improving since the restrictions are being lifted. So we are seeing improvements across the system, which is encouraging. And honestly, whether a city has been lagging or outperforming, what we are seeing is that all markets have improved fairly significantly recently compared to where they were in January and February. 
So as a result of what you just heard, we are comfortable adding back flights to capture additional demand, including Hawaii. And it's great to see demand from California to Hawaii as well as between the islands, ramp back up. And we're finally at a point where we can get to our Hawaii flight schedules up to where we'd hopefully be a year ago before the pandemic. As you know, international testing remains in place. Overall, I'd say our international demand is performing just fine, not a lot to report. At this point, we are only serving 8 of our 14 international stations, and we'll intend to bring the remaining 6 back online as it makes sense and as restrictions ease. 
A little color and perspective on new stations. At this point, we have opened 10 or announced 17 new airports and all of them are performing terrific. In fact, there's not a clunker in the bunch. All of them are generating new customers, additional revenue in collectively are contributing positively to our cash performance. We feel really good about what we are seeing in here first hand. And more to come. So we'll begin service in Fresno on April 25; Destin-Fort Walton Beach on May 6; Myrtle Beach on the 23rd of May; Bozeman, Montana on the 27th; Jackson, Mississippi on June 6. And we also just announced last week, Eugene, Oregon will begin service at August 29, and we will begin service in Bellingham, Washington later this year. So all the new stations that are operating today are meeting or exceeding our expectations. They've been on our radar for years, and it's great to see them open, operational. And honestly, it's kind of -- it's pretty interesting. I think our network planning team is batting 1,000%. So this is really something and the operations are starting up really cleanly. 
In terms of our capacity for the first quarter, capacity decreased 35% year-over-year. It was down 39% compared with the first quarter of 2019, which was consistent with our expectations. And as planned, we added, as Gary alluded to, we added additional capacity in March, which equated to roughly 1,000 flights each day beginning mid-month. And that really paid off as demand improved. And these incremental flights improved our March performance by roughly $150 million -- that's revenue performance by $150 million. Our April capacity is expected to decline 24% and May capacity is expected to decline 18% relative to 2019 levels. Now this includes a modest increase in flying in April and about 3 points of incremental capacity in May compared with our previous guidance, which is really just the result of a stronger demand outlook. At this point, we are in the process of adjusting our June flight schedules. And once the revisions are complete, we expect June ASMs to decline 4% versus 2019. 
And as you've seen throughout the pandemic, actually, we've cut more business-oriented short-haul flying and adding more leisure-oriented longer-haul flying as well as work nights in our itineraries. which is driving higher capacity with newer aircraft, and this makes up roughly 4 to 5 points of the 14-point sequential capacity increase from May to June. And assuming the current trends continue, our preliminary plans for July call for similar levels of capacity as June relative to 2019 levels, and we'll be finalizing our July plans here very shortly. 
So in terms of passenger revenue and capacity, our focus remains on managing the next few months with as much precision as possible, which is what we've been doing throughout the year and improving our revenue performance as well as improving our cash burn performance toward breaking even or better with an emphasis on or better. That's our goal. 
In terms of Other revenues, our Other revenues performed better than passenger revenue in the first quarter and was down 15% year-over-year. For March, though, our Other revenue was actually up 3% year-over-year. Our ancillary products specifically commissions from car, hotel and vacation bookings performed about in line with passenger revenue, no surprise there. But the biggest contributor to our Other revenue performance was our Rapid Rewards program. And the first quarter total revenue from our loyalty program was down 19% year-over-year or 22% versus 2019. When you look at it at just the royalty revenue that flows through Other revenue, revenue was down 12% versus 2019. This is a very strong performance, especially relative to passenger revenues. And I think it just speaks very clearly to the strength of the program as a whole and the high level of engagement that we have with our customers and they, with us. The sequential improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by increases in retail sales and commissions on new card acquisitions. 
Total co-brand card spend in March was only down 1% versus March of 2019 and for the first time since the pandemic began, our credit card portfolio size grew in the first quarter, again relative to 2019. So we're thrilled to see that. So our credit card portfolio remains very strong. We're seeing the average spend per cardholder continue to improve. Attrition continues to be very, very low, and we are really very pleased with the performance of our program. And I think you can see in our results that we have more rapid rewards members, more credit card holders and more engagement from our customers. And now we have more places for them to go, with a lot more leisure destinations. 
And building on that, our brand remains very strong. Our brand NPS scores continued to rank at the very top of the industry, which is something that we focus on and watch a lot, we watch very closely. Our trip NPS, which measures individual flight experiences, is trending even higher right now as well, which speaks to our people's focus on hospitality and producing great on-time performance. So as Mike said, and I am so grateful with our frontline employees. They execute every day with precision and grace and I'm thankful for that. 
And finally, I do want to share a few comments in our perspective regarding our focus on the environment, which seems appropriate since today is Earth Day. Now Gary has already shared our long-term goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, which is aligned with A4A's goal as an industry. And this isn't a new topic for us, though this is something that we've been focused on for a long time. Our focus has certainly intensified over the past year. But just for perspective, since 2002, we've invested more than $620 million in fuel efficiency initiatives, and that's independent of new aircraft. And in 2019, we saved more than 7 million gallons of fuel through flight planning initiatives. 
So this is something that, again, is not new to us. And as Mike discussed earlier, we plan on retiring a significant number about roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and we'll be investing billions of dollars on new aircraft that are 14% more fuel efficient. And as it stands today, the carbon emissions that we generate on a per ASM basis is among the very best in the industry, and our fleet modernization program gives us a massive opportunity to continue to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. 
So that's all great. We also know that fleet model alone isn't nearly enough to get us to our goal of carbon neutral by 2050. In our views of the most promising path over the next 10 to 15 years is a combination of fleet modernization, operational fuel efficiency initiatives, air traffic control modernization and the introduction of economically viable, sustainable aviation fuels or SAF at scale. Today, we have a SAF offtake agreement in place with Red Rock Biofuels, and our teams continue to work with the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL on the development of new SAF feedstocks and pathways. 
We've also recently signed MOUs with both Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 to accelerate the production of SAF, with the objective of achieving affordable SAF with low carbon intensity scores at scale. And the crux of the agreement is to work together toward the production of 300 million gallons of SAF in the 2025 time frame. This is a very ambitious target, and there's a tremendous amount of work to be done, but it's also a really important step forward. And we intend to work very closely with both Marathon and Phillips 66 throughout the process, with the intent to secure large offtake agreements that represent a significant share of the SAF that's produced. 
But to be honest, this effort is not just about Southwest securing more SAF for Southwest. It's also about getting large energy producers into the market, getting production to scale at affordable prices. We also believe that the use of carbon offsets can be appropriate and helpful, but we see this as a bridging technique. Our use of offset so far has been focused on renewable energy credits, which are natural gas offsets to complete our headquartered campus 100% renewable energy plan. And up to this point, we have not been using carbon offsets. But if used appropriately again, they can't be helpful where it's making offsets available to customers or corporations who are looking to offset their travel emissions. So more to come on this, but again, we see offsets as a bridging solution. 
Direct air capture, new airframe, engine technologies and new energy sources such as hydrogen, power liquid or PTL also have tremendous promise, but we see these things as being much further out, call it, 2035 and beyond. And our objective is to focus on things that we feel like we can have a real impact on over the next 10 to 15 years. So this is something that we are absolutely committed to achieving. But to be really clear, the industry is going to have to work together. No single airline can do it alone. It's just impossible. So it's going to take a lot of work with a variety of organizations, including the private sector and nonprofits as well as strong support and policy from the federal government and state governments. And we'll need innovation and scale in the energy industry. And we'll also need continued advancements for the aerospace industry to become carbon neutral by 2050. 
Now Gary has asked me to be the executive sponsor for our environmental efforts, and I've asked Stacy Malphurs, our Vice President of Supply Chain, who is extremely knowledgeable in SAF and end-to-end fuel supply chain to take this on with me as well. So to wrap it up, we'll be providing a comprehensive report of what we are doing and the progress we're making in our annual sustainability report, which we call the Southwest One Report, and we'll be publishing this online to our investor site in the coming weeks. 
So with that, Tammy, I'm going to hand it over to you."

Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first quarter net incom",2122,"All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. 
This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning's press release, our first quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through our second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending. 
Excluding special items, our first quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year-over-year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. 
We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. 
Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we'll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. 
However, we currently estimate our second quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter's ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per aircraft basis each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress towards our long-term environmental goals. 
Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first quarter operating cost decreased 19% year-over-year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. 
In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first quarter advertising spend was down 8% year-over-year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. 
Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary extended emergency time-off program. 
In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense, sequential cost increases from a few items account for about 1/3 of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work. Partially offsetting our second quarter cost pressure from these 3 costs is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. 
Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other 2/3 of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. 
While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. 
Our first quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don't currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the teams at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all-Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable CapEx. 
We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8s. For second quarter, we expect to receive 7 MAX 8 deliveries and retire 3 737-700s. And we will have 1 more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to 6 more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 CapEx. That said, we are well-positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover the majority of our fleet modernization plans, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. 
As expected, our first quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft CapEx and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage CapEx with our order book with aircraft CapEx on firm orders of $700 million next year. 
Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support or $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. 
Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. 
Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. 
In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren't out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work towards breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. 
I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come. With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions."

And I'll let Tammy add if she wants to. I just think it's premature to telegraph what our thoughts might be ultimately in terms of shareholder returns. I'm not a fan of special dividends. I don't mind sharing that. So I also don't mind sharing that I haven't had that thought that we would be doing a special dividend, and we couldn't do it until post September 23 or 2023 anyway. But it's -- we've got 4 phases, I don't know, that we're thinking of. One is survival; second is stabilize; third would be repair; and then fourthly, would be back to prosperity. So we've sort of declared that until we stop losing money, we're still in the survival mode. There's a word out there for what we're thinking. Once we get to prosperity, I'd love for us to get back to handsome shareholder returns, and I just feel like we need to prepare the balance sheet first. 
I got the question this morning on CNBC, and I thought it was a good one. We do share repurchases as you well know. We had a healthy dividend going into pandemic, as you well know. Now we also had the strongest balance sheet and the lowest leverage in our history coming into 2020 and all of that is key in terms of thinking in the future about what we would do with shareholder return. So we've got to get our balance sheet back in order. It's not broken, but we do have some work to do. And that's -- I know we're all aligned here that that's our top priority."

Now the premise that you raised, of course, is that if I could sort of extrapolate that isn't achieved and we sort of bump along -- with my comments initially, yes, our first quarter turned out better than we thought it would be, but we still lost $1 billion. Well, that can't go on indefinitely for any company and certainly for an airline. So I don't think that, that's what we're staring down. I don't think we're looking at $1 billion loss second, third, fourth quarter. So given that, I -- which is the only way I can really answer the question, I don't think we're in that scenario. So therefore, no, because this is a live question on this infrastructure bill. And then finally, no, we're not advocating for anything different other than just trying to provide our input on the spending and the investments that are being contemplated in that bill, along with the prospect of corporate tax increases.

So the -- let me just talk about the business travel for just a second. So the industries that are starting to pop back up again, I consider business demand is falling as opposed to leisure demand, which is hot. But the areas of the business demand that are starting to travel, it's a lot of government DoD. It is manufacturing, some transportation, the areas that are not traveling are the big consulting firms, which by the way, are the biggest consumers we have of air travel. So that's what's really not happening yet. 
I think that in terms of the conversations with the large accounts at this point, given that we are now on the GDS platforms, we're talking about this before, we're starting to see the channel shift that we expect to see, given that we're now on 4 GDS platforms and I guess the honest answer is the volumes are so low, it's just hard to know if we're seeing what we would have expected to see in terms of channel shift from one to the other. We are seeing a little bit of a shift. I think, Andrew jump in, if I'm not correct here, is a little bit of shift from the Sabre BBR basic product into more of the standard GDS platform. So that's working well. 
But I guess just in general, the commentary we, our teams, talk with, in fact, they did a great piece with Hunter. I'm not sure if you guys read it. Took a while to read it, it's pretty long but it was really good. But the conversation was really such that the customer really gets our products. They really want the product. We've just been so hard to do business with, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the conversations with our large corporates are really very, very positive and they just want us to be on the shelf in Sabre and the others, and we will be. So we have seen a fall in business travel, I think."

We can all pontificate. And so all I've been saying is really in response, Mike, to a question about will business travel ever recover. And I think it will. I think it's silly to sit here and say it will never recover. I mean, that's a bold statement. But Mike, it could be a long time. And that's where I've thrown out the 10 years, and I've done that consistently. You know that a typical recessionary recovery is 5 years for business travel. And we've lived through a lot of recessions together. So that, I feel confident of. What I'm not confident about is whether this is a typical recession, number one, and it's got some pluses compared to a typical. It has the negative because of everything that we know about being able to work now with technology virtually and remotely. And that is a huge question mark. 
I'm on another Board besides Southwest, I talk to other CEOs, talk to all my friends and colleagues here at Southwest and we get plenty of anecdotal information that suggests that business travel will not recover to prepandemic levels anytime soon. So there's just no way to know. So no, I'm not predicting it's 10 years. Really, what I was trying to do is sort of tamp down the argument that it will never recover and just simply to say that, who knows? It could be a long recovery time period, but we're going to be prepared, Mike, regardless. And so Tom and Andrew were just talking about GDS. And for Southwest, I think that we will recover business travel faster because we have a new avenue to gain business travelers. And we dramatically under-indexed the managed travel market. And that was because we weren't a part of the GDS. We remedied that. 
We're the largest airline in the United States. By virtue of that, I would argue that we're the largest business airline in the United States. And as I said in my remarks, now the managed travel accounts will have wide access to a great network, great service, no bag fees, no change fees and low fares. They will finally have access to low fares. I think we will do extremely well there."

And now all of a sudden, a deluge of cities, and some of these are actually small markets. And if I think back to Southwest in the past, some small markets, the company historically may have struggled. What -- it sounds like the ramp-up is going fairly well. Andrew, maybe what has changed that you feel much stronger in moving into some of these smaller markets and more quickly? Maybe it's just the pandemic, you strike when the iron is hot, maybe it's the density of the Southwest network, small cities can plug in and you can turn on and be successful far easier today than the Southwest of 10 years ago? Maybe I answered the question, but if you could just give us some color because this is kind of a different mode for Southwest with respect to new city development."

We are methodical. And so prior to the pandemic, we have a practice every year of going through and looking at every place we could fly our aircraft and evaluating them at least in desktop, if not in-person visit. So all these cities were ones that were known to us and evaluated prior to the pandemic. And so when the pandemic, as Gary talked about -- we're unsure about the pace of business travel return. And so because we have a lot of business travelers, if they were not to return in a timely manner, we would have a shortfall in revenue activity to deploy our people and assets against, and with the operating leverage model, you don't want that. So we want to make sure we have enough new cities to cover any potential shortfall in that return. So that led us to go at a bigger scale than normal. 
The cities we chose, we chose also to have a low risk as far as our maturation. And we've been in plenty of small cities for a long time. So a lot of Western Texas cities and Pac Northwest cities, they're modest, and we do quite well, Upstate New York. And the key is a small city that is relevant to a place where we have a large customer base. And so if you look at all these small cities, they're either in marquee destinations under themselves or they're relevant to a nearby large Southwest city, where we have a large customer base who would be big purchasers of tickets through small cities. And so that's what's important to us. And then we want to make sure we go in with at least a level of flight activity that allows for crew efficiencies so that we have originators and terminators that make us not to have crude deadheads that would undermine inefficiency. So all those things must come together for us to add those new cities. So I think prepared and it fits with our model, I think, is the answer."

And so I wouldn't translate what we're doing with these 17 cities as being a violation of even that old rule of thumb, because some of these ""small cities,"" I think, Andrew -- I won't name names because we may not want to telegraph yet, but there are a handful that I can think of that you might think are small. We're thinking there are going to be a dozen or more daily departures into a number of nonstop destinations. So you can make the fact that we now have such a large U.S. presence, it makes a lot of these ""smaller markets"" much more viable today in terms of flight activity than it did 30 years ago. 
But the other thing I would point out is that Miami isn't small. Bush isn't small. Commonwealth Spring isn't small. O'Hare is not small. So we do have a few cities that have 3 or 4 daily departures on the route map. And I would -- Mike would call those small. And we have experience with them, and we know that they can work. I don't think that, that means that every city like that would work. But anyway, it's -- we have been delighted that we could actually have the capacity to put them on the route network here. I got asked earlier today about whether we'll continue this. And I think Andrew is going to need -- assuming that we continue on our recovery path, he's going to need to take a lot of these airplanes and put them back into restoring flight activity into our existing network. So that will challenge our ability to continue doing this play, but they're permanent adds and we're delighted with the performance that we're seeing."

As it begins to thaw, we're going to need to begin to get our network back in business travel shape. And just to give you a little view, I guess people are asking -- ask us, so what does the -- so when does the network get back to normal? Well, the network is not going to get back to what it was because we have 17 new cities on the network. But what I can tell you is when you think about the principles in the characteristics of the Southwest network, those will be intact. Point-to-point, you should expect to see a very similar mix as short, medium, long, a similar mix of direct and connecting traffic. And our focus, once we begin to see business on thaw is we got to begin to put the depth back into the markets like the St. Louis and Milwaukee's and intra-Cal business markets and such. 
So it's going to be an interesting -- but that's also why we're getting more aircraft. So we're going to retire some and are going to have some incrementals. So it's going to take time which is fine because business traffic is not going to show up on one Sunday and all of a sudden, it's back. It's going to take time, and we'll begin to build our fleet back in our network depth back. You spurred a lively topic there, Linenberg. So thank you."

Is the view here that potentially you're going to grow into a marketplace? Potentially take share? Could that sustain lower fares in the future?

And it's just too early to judge that yet. But we have tons of opportunities. We're a growth company. We know how to manage growth, and we would be foolish to pass on what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime to grow this airline in this environment. We are so well positioned. If, in fact, the business travel stays modest over the next 5 to 10 years, we are perfectly positioned to prosper in that environment with our low cost and our low fares."

And Economics 101 tells you that pricing will settle that but at a softer level. So we were down 20% this quarter. And what we'll be prepared for is a very low fare environment for a long time, which gets back into the discussion that we've been having all day about business travel demand. And that is our wheelhouse. We are low cost. We are low fare. And we can live on low fares and we'll certainly make sure that we manage our business accordingly."

If demand falls off from here, we're in a good position. If demand stays flat, we're in a good position. If it increases, we have ability to recall people on ExTO and if it really explodes, we have the ability to go hire people.

And of course, you pick a point in time and you can dodge that number around. But that just gives you some sense. And what Tom was talking about was flying our June schedule at 96% of what we were prepandemic for June. We've had a little bit of attrition. We've had a voluntary separation program, and that's what gets us down from 100% down to this 92% level. So we are comfortable -- we're overstaffed right now in March, April. 
Projecting forward to June, we would be right at the proper staffing, if not a little bit short. So there's pluses and minuses. One department might be a little over, one department might be a little under. But I think beyond -- to Mike's point, beyond June, I think what we're all anxious to see is, well, what do things look like when we get to June. Are we going to hit our forecast as we've anticipated it, with the bookings for July, August, September look as good as we hoped. Is there pent-up demand that is not sustained beyond that? I mean there's just a number of good questions that can be posed at this point. So it's just a little bit premature. 
But if we get to the point where we've got some staffing challenges, I think everybody here would consider that to be a really high-quality problem.

We're obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous 4 quarters of billion-dollar losses, and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first quarter levels, and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that, of course, flowed through to better margins and better cash. 
Yesterday's cash was over $17 billion, and that's plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we're very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we're not detecting any impact at all, again very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. 
So right now, I'm very pleased with all of that. Very pleased with our revenue, our July business and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, profitability in the month of June. The pandemic, of course, turned everybody's world upside down and it's still not completely right side up. But I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage, and it's, of course, even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined, it made it very difficult. 
Things are much better in July, not -- still not where I want us to be but we'll continue to improve, and I'm very confident that we'll adjust as necessary and if necessary. So our immediate focus is on running a very high quality on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low fare point-to-point high utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward. 
Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may, in turn, depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we'll reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So we're very well positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years. 
So things aren't back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved, and we're at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. 
And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan, He'll be our next CEO come February 1 of next year, and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it's going very, very well. Very proud of Bob. He's going to do a terrific job. And I'm going to hang around to support our team in any way that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you."

It's really good to be with you today, and I'm looking forward to reconnecting with many of you over the next few months as I begin to attend more Investor Relations activities. I'm going to make just a few brief remarks. But I'm just -- as Gary said, I'm just super excited for the opportunities to serve Southwest as the next CEO beginning in February. 
And I am very glad that Gary will continue to serve as Executive Chair. Many of you know, Gary has been my mentor and friend for over 3 decades. And the 2 of us, along with Tom and Mike, are already working very hard to ensure that the transition will be a smooth and orderly one. Since the announcement on June 23, I've had the chance to visit and talk with hundreds of our employees around the company. As an example, I was at -- got to spend the day in Atlanta yesterday with our wonderful team there. And I'm just amazed by their spirit, their enthusiasm, their heart for each other and for our customers, and I'm just energized by being with them. 
I'm also focused on continuing to work with our leadership as we continue to lead through the pandemic recovery. And as we start to work on our 2022 planning efforts as we evaluate the post-pandemic environment and the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us here at Southwest. I've been part of the strategy here as we develop our strategy each year, and I'm very confident about our purpose and vision and where we are headed. And I will be very purposeful in how we plan for the next several years. 
Our strategy is sound. We are a low-fare low-cost growth airline that prides ourself in terrific customer service and being a great place to work for our employees. That business model and our people have been the enduring strength for 50 years now, and we've enjoyed unparalleled success in the airline industry. We now have the nation's most robust point-to-point network, and we have at least a decade's worth of attractive growth opportunities in front of us with the Boeing 737. Our customer and brand rankings remain really high year after year, and our commitment to transparency continues with no bag fees and no change fees. We are committed to that. 
We have opportunities in the pipeline to continue enhancing the customer experience as just 1 example and that will be a focus, along with our commitments to both diversity and leadership and in the workplace and to environmental sustainability. We will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position and our investment-grade balance sheet. As always, we'll balance our commercial opportunities, our operational flexibility and reliability and/or financial performance. 
You know we want new itineraries for our customers. We want growth opportunities and job security for our employees, and we want to create significant value and returns for our shareholders. That formula has worked so well for Southwest for decades, and I expect that it will be and continue to be what works for us for decades to come. We have a very deep bench of terrific leaders here at Southwest that are ready to lead for the future, and as a team, we are all very aligned on the future of Southwest Airlines. But I want to say, above all, it's our people that bring our vision and our purpose to life every single day, and I'm just honored to serve them and to support them on a daily basis.

On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. 
Second quarter operating revenues, nonfuel operating costs, fuel costs and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results. And this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. 
These second quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and every day. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter. 
We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward. 
We are mindful of the tight job market as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent. Including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all work groups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter. 
We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages and ramp-up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity, and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs along with wide activity as efficiently as possible while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. 
But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third quarter bottom line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January, and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre pandemic. 
With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than 6 months ago, the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn and drastically cutting capacity and costs. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped, and we are now evolving our focus areas. 
First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we'll be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in, at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. 
Although I don't have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost-efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirements and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So we have flexibility with our capital. 
And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness even coming out of this pandemic. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everybody. Well, our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations. We saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields, and we als",1530,"Okay. Well, thank you, Tammy. Good morning, everybody. Well, our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations. We saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields, and we also saw a steady improvement in business demand, which I'll talk about in just a minute. And we're also pleased to see broad-based improvement across the entire network. So this was not concentrated improvement in certain regions or cities but it really was across the entire system, which was terrific to see. 
June's leisure passenger traffic was actually higher than June 2019 levels, and June's passenger fares were in line with June 2019 levels, very much as we expected. And we also saw a significant improvement in business travel revenues as well, improving from down 77% in May to down 69% in June versus 2019. And just keep in mind that on our Q1 call, we reported that our business revenues were down 88%, so throughout the second quarter, we saw a very steady sequential improvement in business travel from the first quarter. And just as you know, when I talk about business revenue, I'm really referring to managed business travel. 
In terms of third quarter trends, we're continuing to see strong leisure travel throughout the summer. And as I said, June's leisure traffic performance exceeded 2019 numbers, and we're seeing that strength continue into July. In fact, we're estimating that both leisure traffic and fares will trend higher in July relative to 2019 based on the trends that we've seen so far. And we're also seeing continued improvements in close-in demand and yields for business travel as well. So in total, that results in an improving July revenue outlook of down 10% to 15% versus 2019. 
In our earnings release, we also introduced our August revenue outlook of down 12% to 17% versus 2019, and we are estimating that August has a 1- to 2-point headwind compared to August of last year, and this is simply due to the calendar shift that pushes all of Labor Day into September. I think that when you adjust for the calendar shift, we're pleased with the way the booking curve is shaping up for the month, and demand and fares are also shaping up really nicely for August. And this is very consistent with our expectations as we move from our highest leisure demand month, which is July, by the way, into August. 
Now with respect to business travel, the recovery path is less clear but it's also clearly improving. So if you look back to Q1 and then to every month in Q2, we've seen consistent sequential improvements over the past 6 months. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're expecting a continuation of steady weekly improvements in business bookings. It's also very clear that more and more companies are returning to the office. You're seeing that, we're seeing that. And without doubt, we're also seeing that corporate travel restrictions are beginning to be relaxed or removed altogether, which is great to see. 
And as you'd expect, we're doing plenty of our own surveys with our travel management company partners and our business customers, so we're talking with them frequently, we're talking with them directly. And we're very encouraged by what we're hearing from them, but we're also probably more encouraged actually by what we're seeing in terms of travel activity. So business volumes and fares were both down in the second quarter but both showed improvement in April, May and June, and we're expecting sequential improvements in Q3 as well, though we do expect overall yields will continue to be pressured in the third quarter versus 2019. 
The booking for -- or booking curve, rather, for business, as you know, is naturally closer in, so now it's mostly about improving volumes as the booking window tightens up. And I will say that, and I'll just reiterate what Gary said, the guidance that we're giving today doesn't include any impact from the Delta variant. What I will say is though we have not seen any impact on the Delta variant at this point, so our outlook is based on trends that we're currently seeing, all of which, by the way, are very encouraging. 
Just a quick comment or 2 on our Rapid Rewards and ancillary business. We had a great quarter. We saw another strong performance in Q2 in both our Rapid Rewards loyalty program as well as in our Chase co-brand credit card program. And we have more Rapid Reward members today than we did in Q2 of 2019. And June was actually the highest new member acquisition month in the history of the program, which was terrific to see. And our co-brand credit card program is larger now than it was pre pandemic, and retail sales for second quarter were up nearly double digits versus 2019, and the spend per card also beat Q2 of 2019 levels. So as you can imagine, we continue to be very, very pleased with the strength and performance of our loyalty and card programs. Our ancillary revenue trends, such as upgraded boarding and EarlyBird, also performed extraordinarily well in the second quarter, which is what we expect to see as load factors improve to historic levels. 
Just a quick comment on our GDS initiatives, which continue to roll out. And as you know, we've already gone live with Travelport and Amadeus and will be going live on Sabre on July 26, which is this coming Monday. This is a big accomplishment. It's been a tremendous amount of work, it's a big deal and creates a big opportunity for us, and this does complete the implementation phase of our industry standard GDS works. So we now have a full array of distribution channels, which gives our business customers a challenge choice, whether it's a GDS platform or a Direct Connect API channel or our [indiscernible] self-service platform. 
So without a doubt, our Southwest business team is pretty energized. They're pretty jazzed up. They have a great product to sell. We're in the right channels and they are really focused on driving new business. And now that the barrier's removed, there's a big opportunity for us to win more business, both from existing customers, which, by the way, we have a lot of under-indexed as well as new customers. And this is a tough sell for us before moving to industry standard GDS platforms. 
So I think we're in a great position. We have a great business product. We have great value. As of Monday, we'll be in all the managed travel distribution channels. We have a great sales team. So I'm looking forward to all the we're going to make here. 
Just a quick comment on the network. Tammy alluded to it, but before I wrap up, I just want to talk about that for a second to give just a bit of perspective, I'm sure we'll get into it in Q&A. And as you've seen, we've made some pretty meaningful changes in additions to our network since the pandemic began 14, 15 months ago. And over the past year, we've announced service to 18 new airports. And at this point, 15 of the 18 are now up and running. And all the new markets are either performing within our expectations or ahead of our expectations. And each 1 is a very strong, very natural addition to our network that we've wanted to do for quite some period of time. 
And as you know, new stations have a development curve and we understand that and we get that. And we are very pleased with where these stations are at this point. They'll have the time to develop. And as I said, all of them are meeting or exceeding our expectations. And we also have the objective, and again, Tammy alluded to this, of restoring many of our pre-pandemic routes and O&D frequencies while also maturing in new markets. 
So in terms of aircraft investments, our 18 new airports represent nearly 100 nonstock markets and over 280 new trips per day. And by the end of the year, they'll utilize roughly 55 aircraft. And with our recent additions to Hawaii, which really is the culmination of the original plan, which is suspended because of the pandemic, we're at 37 trips per day from the Mainland U.S. to Hawaii with nearly 40 inter-island trips per day and that utilizes roughly 37 aircraft. So we've committed substantial amounts of aircraft to new city opportunities and to Hawaii. And both investments are paying off and meeting our expectations. It was the right decisions. 
Our Boeing order book gives us a tremendous amount of optionality, and that allows us to fund our current network investments while also allowing us to pursue the planned restoration of our network, all of which we'll be working through in our 2022 planning process that Tammy just alluded to. So I'll tell you, I think that we are very, very well positioned for the future. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to my friend, Mike, to talk about the operation."

From an operational perspective, I would say this is a pivotal quarter for us. We moved from, I would describe, managing and moderating our operation in the first quarter to really an acceleration focused in the second quarter. If you would compare just March to June, those [ 2 ] months, we added about 650 additional daily trips, so that's a 25% increase. 
And then our customer and bag volumes far surpass that. They were up nearly double that with a 45% increase between those 2 months. And that is just a monumental increase and it's -- we've done in a short period of time. And inside an airport environment that I would say is really still adapting and everything in that environment seems to take a bit more time today. 
Our travel mix, as you know, has been reported as primarily leisure, so our precheck customers from a TSA perspective were down over 10% from -- as compared to June 2019. If you go out to the airport restaurants, a lot of them have reduced hours or staffing levels so there are longer lines. The third-party providers for wheelchair services have been able to scale with customer demand. The hotel shuttle services are less frequent. And of course, the airport is one of the last experiences across the country where masks are required throughout the travel day. 
And considering all that, that's just a tough environment to live in every day. And I am tremendously proud of our employees. They continue to answer the call and they really are Southwest warriors. And in fact, they produced a very solid second quarter operation. So in the midst of that increasing customer volume, we also launched service to 7 new cities. We rolled out our new maintenance IT system. We launched Hawaii service from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and Phoenix. We expanded our existing Hawaii service. And we accomplished of all that while delivering an on-time performance of 76.3%, and that was right in line with our 2017 through 2019 results pre COVID. 
The bag handling remained exceptional. It was our best quarterly performance outside of last year's second quarter when travel demand was really low. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT for all the marketing carriers. So just -- again, I'm just very, very proud of our employees. 
Now June was our most difficult month of the quarter. Our April and May outperformed previous years in all of our key operational metrics. And even with the customer volume increase, June was off to a solid start. Mid-month, we did run into a combination of technology issues, followed by weaker weather challenges across our entire network. And those introduced some extreme delays into the network, and it caused significant crew availability concerns as well as delays and cancellations that impacted our customers, and that dropped our OTP to 62.4% for June. And we need to and we will do better than that moving forward. 
As we moved through July, weather is still a bit of a concern as is the overall tempo of the airport environment. But the entire industry is feeling the impact of those things, and that's reflected in the overall industry OTP thus far in July. We expect our operational reliability to continually improve from our June performance. We use planning models that require an adequate level of airplanes and people and facilities to run our schedules. As we entered into the second quarter, we had all those resources aligned and we were on track until roughly mid-June. 
And so there are a couple of focus areas for the operation as we move forward. First, passenger demand is very strong and our load factors going in and out of our large cities are 90-plus percent most days. And we're still ramping up the operation, and we have 16 fewer flight than we did in June of 2019, which for us means there are fewer ways to re-accommodate customers when we have delays or cancellations, while higher volumes and fewer re-accommodation options translate for us into a longer operating day. 
So we're adding staffing in several of our large cities to have additional resources to cover those longer operating days and reduce the need for a premium pay. We've increased our minimum starting pay to $15 an hour to better source applicants for those positions. And we're offering premium pay for our employees to pick up open shifts on their scheduled time-off just in the meantime. 
The second thing that we're focused on is sourcing flight instructors, so we can ensure that we can support the training needs for our pilots returning from extended time-off as well as our recurrent training needs as we continue to add flying to the network throughout this year and then set ourselves up for 2022. 
It feels really good to finally be in a position where we can add flights and pick up our operating momentum. It was a bit messy as we throttled down our activity, and it doesn't surprise me that it's a bit messy as we're accelerating it. But our employees just navigate those -- through those things heroically. They have great hearts for our customers and for each other, and I'm just so proud and thankful for their efforts every day. And with that, Ryan, I think I'll turn it back over to you."

And I think that the opportunity for us, I think this kind of gets to your point or the answer to your question, we have a lot more opportunity to drive a lot more depth within the current accounts we have with GDS. So I think that you'll see that begin to drive up our Southwest business numbers, if you will. 
But very consistently, we're seeing about 5 points of improvement in Southwest business bookings each month over the past 4 or 5 months. We said, I guess it was the first quarter call, Ryan, we said that we -- our expectation was Southwest business or business travel will be down about 50% by year-end. If you just kind of extrapolate where we are right now, we would beat that. I think our expectation would probably be at 50% by the end of this quarter and certainly beat that by the end of the year, assuming things keep going. 
So I'm not sure if we're behind our competitors or not, to be honest with you. I feel like going from down 88% to down 69% on the path towards down 50% by the end of the quarter is pretty much in line with the market. But I think we're going to see more and more penetration with the GDS implementations. And again, we just under-indexed significantly in these big accounts, so that's an opportunity for us."

And I think one could assume that they're smaller companies, maybe sole proprietors or what-have-you. But our frequent flyer credits, and there are just other inputs that we look at that would suggest that, that is a conservative number. 
So I agree with Tom. We're the largest airline in the country. We carry more people than any other airline. I think we carry more business travelers than any other airline. So I find it hard to believe that we're inconsistent with anybody else. But admittedly, we hear -- we hear the same numbers that you hear, and we just can't -- when out surveying people, we can't be, for sure, what their purpose of travel is. But our frequent flyers, those flight credits are down far less than 69%, which is some indication. Of course, it could be a businessperson who is traveling for personal reasons. We just don't know.

But no, I'm just kidding. But yes, I think a couple of things. One, we -- at the end of the day, as the CEO, you cannot do it all yourself. It's all about the team and we have a wonderful team of leaders here. And I think we're both very passionate about focusing on that, developing our team, developing our leaders, developing the ""next generation"" of leaders and preparing people. And so I think that -- I feel like we're very similar in that way. 
Yes. In the same way that Gary invested in me and many others for decades, but I think at the passion point of mind to be able to continue to do that because it's all about not just what we can do as we have this change, it's about what we can do to set Southwest Airlines up for success for 20 and 30 and even more years. 
On the style front, in addition to that, I think our styles are, again, very similar. We're very collaborative. We love bringing the team into the conversation and the decisioning. If there's a difference probably, I -- and this can be good and bad, I'm probably a little more of a driver, maybe a little more impatient sometimes, which is probably the way a lot of my assignments over the years have been go do things, go get the integration underway and push through completion as an example. So that can be a benefit in terms of driving and getting things accomplished in our plan. 
But I also have to work on sometimes slowing down, being collaborative and just make sure we make wise decisions here as we -- as of course, we will. How we would approach the plan and our strategic plan, in particular, were very similar. I think there -- as you know, we're very focused on things like GDS and modernizing the fleet. Plans change though. You complete a set of things and you roll into the next set of things, and you want to be very thoughtful about what those are. We want to be, again, collaborative with our team about developing that set of next strategic initiatives. And so we will work, as part of our '22 planning, to think about that next set of things. 
I mentioned this upfront, I'm focused around things that are just maybe part of what is an expectation today. So our customers expect us to work with them and engage with them and produce the customer experience that is maybe again terrific. Our employees are just terrific, but they expect a lot of things to be quick, delivered over mobile platforms, easy to resolve, even an situation. Our employees expect the same thing. They want it to be very easy to work with Southwest Airlines, manage their shifts off of their iPhone, for example. And so I'll be very focused on some of those things. 
The other -- and again, this is a focus that both Gary and myself and our whole team, I'm very focused on our diversity commitments. We laid some of that out next -- last year. We have things that we need to focus on. We, in particular, our diversity in our senior leadership group. And so you will likely hear me talking a lot about that. 
As Tom mentioned, we have a lot of focus in our sustainability commitments. And so plans change over time. They always do. The initiatives we have on the table right now are what I and Gary and others were involved in 10 years ago and so they're always going to shift. But we're going to make sound judgments. We're going to develop the team. We're going to stand by the principles that make Southwest Airlines great, our business model, our people balancing our results with our operations and with our customer experience. 
And so maybe a long-winded answer, but I think we have -- we're generally a lot of similarities in how we approach the business and the problems and our people."

I mentioned I was in Atlanta yesterday so you could see the hiring and labor complexity firsthand there. So I think you're -- multiple things, you're in a broad-based market with supply shortages. So there's just not enough people to fill the jobs that are open. I might -- the stat that I think I've heard it, we went into the pandemic with open -- a lot of open jobs here in the U.S. And I think we have had 9 million or 10 million folks exit the workforce at this point. 
So we all see that the help wanted signs everywhere. So you're competing in a market that is just tougher. So as an example, we are getting fewer applications for open position than we are used to. So it's just going to take a lot of vigor around the focus on hiring. 
Some of the differences are regional. I would say they're more about how to triage critical positions. So we have places where it's more critical to the operation than others. For example, we are really -- we've got a full press on to hire on the Denver ramp as an example because there are needs there. We have full -- we have a full press to hire flight instructors because we have plenty of pipeline -- a pipeline of pilots we feel like but we need to get them trained. We have folks coming off of the XTO, and it just takes time to train and get them back into the workforce. So there needs to rebuild our training capacity just like our hiring capacity. 
So I think I would tell you the -- I'm probably more focused on this being a broad-based problem in terms of just labor availability than a narrow issue in terms of a specific job. The biggest question to me, I think we're fighting our way through because we'll get through rebuilding, recruiting teams and training teams and that short term, those are short-term issues is, how long does this persist? Do we plan against this being a 3-month issue as the folks are really going to return to the workforce, for example, once school starts? Or are we planning, someagainst a multiyear issue where it's going to be folks coming back into the workforce very slowly? And that's a difficult question, which means you just have to be nimble in your planning, how we think about bringing aircraft into the schedule, which I'm very pleased we have the flexibility, how you think about planning your schedules and how you think about staffing your schedules. The last thing we want to do is put a schedule out there where we cannot staff. And so there's just -- there's a lot of focus on this. I will tell you, if it's not the #1 focus right now, it is 1A, which is getting -- getting our hiring in place and our staffing in place."

How that's been executed for the past year, it's been shifted a little bit just by virtue of the environment. 
But our philosophy is the same. So we do want to get back to the pre-pandemic mix of direct versus connecting flights, call it, 75-25 historically. We're a little bit skewed off of that's probably, I don't know, Andrew, 72-28 8 or something like that. So we want to get that back. We also want to get back to our mix of short, medium and long haul flying, call it, rough terms 40-40-20, short, medium, long as percent. And right now, it's more like 30-40-30, because those short-haul flights, those are the business-driven flights. And the business traffic wasn't there. We need to create the leisure capacity. It came from short haul. So as business comes back, you'll begin to see us just reinstate that kind of flying.
So there are many, many productive uses of the capacity. And again, the capacity -- if the demand does not show up, we have the ability to retire 737, 700s, right, and just continue to improve the fleet. So I think we got in fact, either Mike said this or Tammy said this or we've all said this, the flexibility we have on the upside of the downside is really positive. It's really strong."

That's 15% of our route system, as I recall. That we have reallocated from call it more business-oriented markets, i.e., short to the longer, more leisure oriented. So I think that speaks somewhat to what you're describing. But -- the other thing I would comment on 2019, in 2019, we were close to providing the network that we wanted, because we were constrained in that scenario by the fleet. And so we're already trying to get back to where we were plus. And all of this is, as we've all said, it's all dependent upon demand materializing like we're thinking. But yes, I think we've got a great opportunity. And as long as we can get it, I think at this point, the people, we'll be able to deliver."

And I think Gary someone needs for retirement present to get you that recipe for capacity growth on a pillar or something. That was great. I like that. If I could just maybe sneak 1 more modeling type question shorter term in looking through the monthly revenue forecast, we see August step down a little bit from July. I think there's some holiday movement in there, as you mentioned, and perhaps second half of August is a little bit more back-to-school given you're kind of south and southeast part of your network. If that's right on the return to school, driving a little bit less leisure demand, while corporate is still depressed, would it follow that September should also see a sequential step-down in performance versus August? Or are there other factors at play?"

I think that the -- first of all, I think that the calendar shift from 2 points from August and September is just that it's a calendar shift. It doesn't really belie the underlying strength of the business. So August is performing well. So I'm not concerned about August. There are no red flags in August, but it does have the natural seasonality. The first half is strong leisure. The second half is back to school, and that's where the business traveling begins to kick in and pick up the slack and that kind of thing. So we're waiting to see that. We feel pretty good about that. 
In terms of September, we did something this year that was really creative. So I'm kind of smiling at Andrew right now because he and his team sorted this out and worked through it. But we had a 50th anniversary sale that was really all about driving leisure demand in the back half of September. September, call it, second week of September through November 3, some such date, but it's basically trying to fill in upfront the leisure bookings early to secure a nice solid foundation book of business. And from that point forward throughout the rest of September and October, you're able to begin to manage just the remaining booking window, if you will. So that has worked really well.
In fact, the 50th anniversary sale, the 3-day sale. I think 2 of the 3 days, Andrew, worked 2 of the top in fact #1 and #2 in terms of our history over 50 years of bookings, right? So this thing really worked. Point being, we have a very solid foundation of leisure bookings in place for September. I'm very curious to see what's going to happen with business travel post Labor Day. Everything we're sensing, feeling, hearing is suggesting that you're going to see it begin to come back. What I'm really encouraged by is, I got to be quick, I'm taking too much time, on the top so corporate travel accounts, 7 are professional services consulting firms, they're all traveling. The lockdowns are removed. So they are traveling, and that's a big deal for us, and that just begins to generate more and more. So I think it's beginning to pick up some steam. So I'm nonplussed by the August issue you raised. I don't think that's an issue. September, we've built a good solid book of leisure, and I feel good about where we are."

As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impact that we called out, our third quarter nonfuel",560,"Yes. Savi, I can start, and I'm sure others will want to chime in here as well. But just to take you through our thought process here. As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impact that we called out, our third quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit sharing would be forecast to trend in line below 19 unit cost levels. So while most of these near-term cost pressures should be one time or nonrecurring as we move beyond this ramp-up period, we have always really considered getting back to 2019 unit cost levels at sort of a point in time target. And we shared that sentiment with you, I know before. 
As far as the cost base in 2019, we were hearing extra employees, as you pointed out, due to the MAX grounding. However, when you think about that, the nominal cost of that was really overshadowed by the 7 points of capacity that we were unable to fly back in 2019 that caused the outsized inflation. So if you fast forward to where we are today, we have a lower overall headcount due to a voluntary retirements, but just keep in mind, we've had 2 years of right inflation for our employees. And as we've already covered with you, we've recalled the vast majority of those employees from extended time off. The recall will help us, of course, as we continue adding trips here in the third and the fourth quarter, but it does reduce the benefit from our voluntary leave program by about $50 million in both third quarter as well as fourth quarter.
And the other thing to consider is that we are now back to 2019 levels and we are building toward 2019 trip levels, as I pointed out earlier. So just -- so we'll have some noise here as we've already covered with you all. It's just not as clean as we would like as we're adding back in capacity. And we'll need to do some hiring as we've already covered with you all for our work -- for many of our work groups to support that true growth in the second half and as we restore our network next year. 
But what I really wanted to get to is as we get back to restoring our network and we kind of get in a rhythm here, we should have more operating leverage as we bring back on more capacity. So I think that's a really key point for you all. We're just -- it's just a little messy here. But that is obviously our goal. Our goal is to scale as efficiently as we can as we restore our network. So I think, hopefully, that's helpful. We're going to be really focused on our productivity metrics like employees for aircraft, and we're going to all work together just to be as efficient as we can and really go back to more of our history of having very highly productive employees and that will be anchored around our point-to-point network and our all Boeing 737 fleet. So I feel like our competitive cost advantages are very much intact, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that we scale efficiently and offset inflationary pressures, which is not unique to Southwest as best we can."

But I'll try to just provide you just a couple points, just to give you a little color. We do -- just to be clear, though, we do expect the current cost inflation and salary wages and benefits from our operational strain to be temporary. And here in the near term, we anticipate some ongoing cost pressures and other cost categories as we ramp up our flying and that's obviously like maintenance, airport and other operating costs. So there will be some costs that come back on as we add capacity as we recover. 
And then there will be some choppiness, too, as we bring back our flying. Just looking ahead to fourth quarter, as an example, our maintenance cost will be burdened more in fourth quarter due to just bringing the 700s that Gary mentioned out of storage and back into service. And we're realizing airport cost pressures as well. And then the inflation we've already covered. So again, I think it really goes back to as we as we scale up, we'll have more operating leverage and we'll -- I think the key here is to get back to those 2019 productivity levels.

And what you saw for us last year, we came out with commitments that were really around diversity in particular, racial diversity in our senior leadership group. So I think what you find is that as you look at our broad employee base, we are very diverse. So particularly on the front line, I think I would -- my guess would be that our diversity in our overall workforce, particularly the front line for the most part matches what you would see here in the United States. I think we're in really good shape there. But as you move sort of up the leadership chain here, and again, I'm thinking about our senior leadership, it is hard to argue that we don't have some work to do. While we have terrific leaders, we have a terrific pipeline of leaders, and it's really just about making sure that as we think about our succession planning and our long-term pipelines that those are diverse. We -- our hiring practices focus on thinking about diversity as a component where do we recruit, how do we think about hiring and how we choose to hire.
And then, again, because if you just took our senior leadership group as an example, where we do have some work to do, I would argue, and that was part of our goal stated last year. it's a long succession pipeline to move from a kind of an entry-level leadership position, ultimately into a senior leadership position. That may be a decade-long process. So it's very focused on, to be honest, the processes we use to think about how we hire and how we recruit and where we hire now and where we recruit. And then how we think about just improving our diversity in senior leadership. And then again, that depends on the pipeline. We're looking at things just classic sponsorship and mentorship programs, which we all do. And so again, I wouldn't take that as wow, we have a big issue. I think we -- historically, you're right. We have, I think, produced really good results. But there is improvement that we think we need to focus on there.

It was very well coordinated between our financial objectives, our commercial opportunity and our operational capabilities. It was very well planned. It was planned based on our historic modeling of what kind of resources we need for what kind of activity, which we have 50 years of experience doing. And we included some cushion, for lack of a better word. So turn times as an example were actually planned to be higher than what we would otherwise expect. And in hindsight, there are some elements of our plan that were too tight. That being 1 of them at some of our locations.

And I think we want to be -- we can see some elements of where that's manifesting. What we do know is we have a different network than 2 years ago. We have a much higher proportion of consumers traveling. That has translated into much heavier baggage loads and also buying itineraries that are complex, i.e., connecting, which also translates into more connecting bags. So we can see things today that we would not have known, when we put the schedule into effect. I can assure you, we'll be factoring that in prospectively. So that's the 1 very tangible thing that I've seen so far. 
And again, you've got experts in the room here that may want to chime in. But the overall allegation that we were understaffed is not true. That is incorrect. Meaning that it wasn't understaffing that's led to delays.  The problem becomes -- the delays, whatever the reason for is puts pressure on the staffing, because the days are longer or as Mike was describing, how flight crews end up diverted in the wrong place and out a position and so do airplanes. So getting the airline back on the tracks obviously is job 1. But our people have done a phenomenal job. They're working very hard. Mark -- Mike described some of the challenges in the environment. It's just -- I blame it on the pandemic. It's messy. It's messy coming in. It's certainly messy coming. Anything you guys want to add?"

So our point-to-point network is it's a different model than most other airlines out. And the way that we are able to absorb significant events in that kind of a model is we would generally cancel a flight, get the airline back on time and then we would reaccommodate customers through other alternatives that we had. And we do that very successfully year in and year out. The biggest change that I think we faced this year with 2020 hindsight is we can't absorb those significant events as efficiently this year as we did in the past, because we don't have as much frequency in our network today that we did yesterday, but we will in the future.
And so what that is causing us to do is to run those flights a little bit later, and it extends the operating day. And so that's really the crux of the issue. And then the solve for that is as we grow the network and add flights back, that solves itself. And then also, we're going to come into a period of time where we don't have the thunderstorms and these pop-up weather events that we do here in June and July. So I feel like the worst part of all that is behind us. And given all the information that we had, as Gary said, we were planned appropriately well. Just not able to absorb those significant events like we could in the past. Saying all of that, we're roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of dealing with those things today."

So our flight attendants, they have training on handling passenger disruptions and just how to deescalate events, and we have recurrent training with respect to that. And I think that they do a very, very good job with that. As you mentioned, there has been a marked increase in, what I would say, abusive customer behaviors, and that's throughout the whole industry. And I know that it's a small subset of travelers to be sure. But we haven't experienced these kinds of violent outbreaks before. And I can understand from a customer's perspective, maybe how some of that frustration builds up. But we have no tolerance for customers to take out that frustration on our people or anyone else for that matter and especially if those are in physically threatening or assaulting manners.
And so we try to be as hospitable as we can as part of our operating philosophy day in and day out. But we do have a responsibility to inform customers of the federal mask mandate. And we do participate in the enforcement of that mask mandate by reporting abusive and threatening behaviors to authorities. We have been very vocal with our unions about having these authorities follow-up and be as aggressive as they can on these abusive customers. And in addition to that, we will add customers to our restricted travel list if they are abusing our employees."

That's -- well, that's a political question to a degree. So I don't know whether the mandate will be extended or not. What we have been consistently advocating is that we follow the CDC guidelines, which is if you are vaccinated, no mask required. And if you are not vaccinated, then you should wear the mask. And unless that changes from the CDC, we wouldn't advocate from a Southwest perspective or the A4A for that matter, extending the mask mandate. You've got the Delta variant now that is somewhat new information at this point. So I'm sure that is being very carefully thought through and studied. But I'm not aware of any effort underway to extend the mask mandate. And we -- at least at this -- as of today, we're not advocating an extension."

We're obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous 4 quarters of billion-dollar losses, and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first quarter levels, and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that, of course, flowed through to better margins and better cash. 
Yesterday's cash was over $17 billion, and that's plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we're very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we're not detecting any impact at all. Again, very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. 
So right now, I'm very pleased with all of that. Very pleased with our revenue, our July business and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, of profitability in the month of June. The pandemic, of course, turned everybody's world upside down and it's still not completely right side up. 
But I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage, and it's, of course, even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined. It made it very difficult. 
Things are much better in July. It's not -- still not where I want us to be but we'll continue to improve, and I'm very confident that we'll adjust as necessary and if necessary. So our immediate focus is on running a very high-quality, on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low fare point-to-point high-utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward.
Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may, in turn, depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we'll reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So we're very well positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years.
So things aren't back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved, and we're at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. 
And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan, He'll be our next CEO come February 1 of next year, and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it's going very, very well. 
Very proud of Bob. He's going to do a terrific job. And I'm going to hang around to support our team in any way that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you."

It's really good to be with you today, and I'm looking forward to reconnecting with many of you over the next few months as I begin to attend more Investor Relations activities. I'm going to make just a few brief remarks. But I'm just -- as Gary said, I'm just super excited for the opportunities to serve Southwest as the next CEO beginning in February.
And I am very glad that Gary will continue to serve as Executive Chair. Many of you know, Gary has been my mentor and friend for over 3 decades. And the 2 of us, along with Tom and Mike, are already working very hard to ensure that the transition will be a smooth and orderly one. 
Since the announcement on June 23, I've had the chance to visit and talk with hundreds of our employees around the company. As an example, I was at -- got to spend the day in Atlanta yesterday with our wonderful team there. And I'm just amazed by their spirit, their enthusiasm, their heart for each other and for our customers, and I'm just energized by being with them. 
I'm also focused on continuing to work with our leadership as we continue to lead through the pandemic recovery. And as we start to work on our 2022 planning efforts as we evaluate the post-pandemic environment and the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us here at Southwest. I've been part of the strategy here as we develop our strategy each year, and I'm very confident about our purpose and vision and where we are headed. And I will be very purposeful in how we plan for the next several years.
Our strategy is sound. We are a low-fare, low-cost growth airline that prides ourselves in terrific customer service and being a great place to work for our employees. That business model and our people have been the enduring strength for 50 years now, and we've enjoyed unparalleled success in the airline industry. We now have the nation's most robust point-to-point network, and we have at least a decade's worth of attractive growth opportunities in front of us with the Boeing 737. 
Our customer and brand rankings remain really high year after year, and our commitment to transparency continues with no bag fees and no change fees. We are committed to that. We have opportunities in the pipeline to continue enhancing the customer experience as just one example and that will be a focus, along with our commitments to both diversity and leadership and -- in the workplace and to environmental sustainability. 
We will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position and our investment-grade balance sheet. As always, we'll balance our commercial opportunities, our operational flexibility and reliability and/or financial performance. You know we want new itineraries for our customers. We want growth opportunities and job security for our employees, and we want to create significant value and returns for our shareholders. 
That formula has worked so well for Southwest for decades, and I expect that it will be and continue to be what works for us for decades to come. We have a very deep bench of terrific leaders here at Southwest that are ready to lead for the future, and as a team, we are all very aligned on the future of Southwest Airlines. 
But I want to say, above all, it's our people that bring our vision and our purpose to life every single day, and I'm just honored to serve them and to support them on a daily basis. And with that, I will turn it over to you, Tammy."

I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving",905,"Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. 
Second quarter operating revenues, nonfuel operating costs, fuel costs and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results. And this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. 
These second quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and every day. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter.
We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels, such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward.
We are mindful of the tight job market as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent, including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all work groups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter.
We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages and ramp-up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity, and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs along with wide activity as efficiently as possible while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. 
But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third quarter bottom line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January, and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre-pandemic. 
With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than 6 months ago, the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn and drastically cutting capacity and costs. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped, and we are now evolving our focus areas.
First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we'll be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in, at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. 
Although I don't have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost-efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. 
We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirement and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So we have flexibility with our capital.
And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness, even coming out of this pandemic. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everybody. Well, our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations.

Well, our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations. We saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields, and we also saw a steady improvement in business demand, which I'll talk about in just a minute. And we're also pleased to see broad-based improvement across the entire network. So this was not concentrated improvement in certain regions or cities but it really was across the entire system, which was terrific to see. 
June's leisure passenger traffic was actually higher than June 2019 levels, and June's passenger fares were in line with June 2019 levels, very much as we expected. And we also saw significant improvement in business travel revenues as well, improving from down 77% in May to down 69% in June versus 2019. 
And just keep in mind that on our Q1 call, we reported that our business revenues were down 88%, so throughout the second quarter, we saw a very steady sequential improvement in business travel from the first quarter. And just so you know, when I talk about business revenue, I'm really referring to managed business travel. 
In terms of third quarter trends, we're continuing to see strong leisure travel throughout the summer. And as I said, June's leisure traffic performance exceeded 2019 numbers, and we're seeing that strength continue into July. In fact, we're estimating that both leisure traffic and fares will trend higher in July relative to 2019 based on the trends that we've seen so far. And we're also seeing continued improvements in close-in demand and yields for business travel as well. So in total, that results in an improving July revenue outlook of down 10% to 15% versus 2019.
In our earnings release, we also introduced our August revenue outlook of down 12% to 17% versus 2019, and we are estimating that August has a 1- to 2-point headwind compared to August of last year, and this is simply due to the calendar shift that pushes all of Labor Day into September. I think that when you adjust for the calendar shift, we're pleased with the way the booking curve is shaping up for the month, and demand and fares are also shaping up really nicely for August. And this is very consistent with our expectations as we move from our highest leisure demand month, which is July, by the way, into August. 
Now with respect to business travel, the recovery path is less clear, but it's also clearly improving. So if you look back to Q1 and then to every month in Q2, we've seen consistent sequential improvements over the past 6 months. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing, and we're expecting a continuation of steady weekly improvements in business bookings. 
It's also very clear that more and more companies are returning to the office. You're seeing that, we're seeing that. And without a doubt, we're also seeing that corporate travel restrictions are beginning to be relaxed or removed altogether, which is great to see. 
And as you'd expect, we're doing plenty of our own surveys with our travel management company partners and our business customers, so we're talking with them frequently, we're talking with them directly and we're very encouraged by what we're hearing from them, but we're also probably more encouraged actually by what we're seeing in terms of travel activity. 
So business volumes and fares were both down in the second quarter but both showed improvement in April, May and June, and we're expecting sequential improvements in Q3 as well, though we do expect overall yields will continue to be pressured in the third quarter versus 2019.
The booking for -- or booking curve, rather, for business, as you know, is naturally closer in, so now it's mostly about improving volumes as the booking window tightens up. And I will say that, and I'll just reiterate what Gary said, the guidance that we're giving today doesn't include any impact from the Delta variant. What I will say is though we have not seen any impact from the Delta variant at this point. So our outlook is based on trends that we're currently seeing, all of which, by the way, are very encouraging.
Just a quick comment or 2 on our Rapid Rewards and ancillary business. We had a great quarter. We saw another strong performance in Q2 in both our Rapid Rewards loyalty program as well as in our Chase co-brand credit card program. And we have more Rapid Reward members today than we did in Q2 of 2019. And June was actually the highest new member acquisition month in the history of the program, which was terrific to see. 
And our co-brand credit card program is larger now than it was pre-pandemic, and retail sales for second quarter were up nearly double digits versus 2019, and the spend per card also beat Q2 of 2019 levels. So as you can imagine, we continue to be very, very pleased with the strength and performance of our loyalty and card programs. Our ancillary revenue trends, such as upgraded boarding and EarlyBird, also performed extraordinarily well in the second quarter, which is what we expect to see as load factors improve to historic levels.
Just a quick comment on our GDS initiatives, which continue to roll out. And as you know, we've already gone live with Travelport and Amadeus and will be going live on Sabre on July 26, which is this coming Monday. This is a big accomplishment. It's been a tremendous amount of work, it's a big deal and creates a big opportunity for us, and this does complete the implementation phase of our industry standard GDS works. 
So we now have a full array of distribution channels, which gives our business customers their channel of choice, whether it's a GDS platform or a Direct Connect API channel or our SWABIZ self-service platform. 
So without a doubt, our Southwest business team is pretty energized. They're pretty jazzed up. They have a great product to sell. We're in the right channels and they are really focused on driving new business. And now that the barrier's removed, there's a big opportunity for us to win more business, both from existing customers, which, by the way, we have a lot of. We just under-index as well as new customers. And this is a tough sell for us before moving to industry-standard GDS platforms. 
So I think we're in a great position. We have a great business product. We have great value. As of Monday, we'll be in all the managed travel and distribution channels. We have a great sales team. So I'm looking forward to all the progress we're going to make here.
Just a quick comment on the network. Tammy alluded to it, but before I wrap up, I just want to talk about that for a second to give just a bit of perspective, I'm sure we'll get into it in Q&A. 
And as you've seen, we've made some pretty meaningful changes in additions to our network since the pandemic began 14, 15 months ago. And over the past year, we've announced service to 18 new airports. And at this point, 15 of the 18 are now up and running. And all the new markets are either performing within our expectations or ahead of our expectations. And each one is a very strong, very natural addition to our network that we've wanted to do for quite some period of time.
And as you know, new stations have a development curve and we understand that and we get that. And we are very pleased with where these stations are at this point. They'll have the time to develop. And as I said, all of them are meeting or exceeding our expectations. And we also have the objective, and again, Tammy alluded to this, of restoring many of our pre-pandemic routes and O&D frequencies, while also maturing in new markets. 
So in terms of aircraft investments, our 18 new airports represent nearly 100 nonstock markets and over 280 new trips per day. And by the end of the year, they'll utilize roughly 55 aircraft. And with our recent additions to Hawaii, which really is the culmination of the original plan, which is suspended because of the pandemic, we're at 37 trips per day from the Mainland U.S. to Hawaii, with nearly 40 inter-island trips per day and that utilizes roughly 37 aircraft. 
So we've committed substantial amounts of aircraft to new city opportunities and to Hawaii. And both investments are paying off and meeting our expectations. It was the right decisions. Our Boeing order book gives us a tremendous amount of optionality, and that allows us to fund our current network investments, while also allowing us to pursue the planned restoration of our network, all of which we'll be working through in our 2022 planning process that Tammy just alluded to. 
So I'll tell you, I think that we are very, very well positioned for the future. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to my friend, Mike, to talk about the operation."

From an operational perspective, I would say this is a pivotal quarter for us. We moved from, I would describe, managing and moderating our operation in the first quarter to really an acceleration focused in the second quarter. If you would compare just March to June, those 2 months, we added about 650 additional daily trips, so that's a 25% increase. 
And then our customer and bag volumes far surpass that. They were up nearly double that with a 45% increase between those 2 months. And that is just a monumental increase and it's -- was done in a short period of time. And inside an airport environment that I would say is really still adapting and everything in that environment seems to take a bit more time today. 
Our travel mix, as you know, has been reported as primarily leisure, so our precheck customers from a TSA perspective were down over 10% from -- as compared to June 2019. If you go out to the airport restaurants, a lot of them have reduced hours or staffing levels so there are longer lines. The third-party providers for wheelchair services have been able to scale with customer demand. The hotel shuttle services are less frequent. And of course, the airport is one of the last experiences across the country where masks are required throughout the travel day. 
And considering all that, that's just a tough environment to live in every day. And I am tremendously proud of our employees. They continue to answer the call and they really are Southwest warriors. And in fact, they produced a very solid second quarter operation. 
So in the midst of that increasing customer volume, we also launched service to 7 new cities. We rolled out our new maintenance IT system. We launched Hawaii service from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and Phoenix. We expanded our existing Hawaii service. And we accomplished of all that while delivering an on-time performance of 76.3%, and that was right in line with our 2017 through 2019 results pre-COVID. 
The bag handling remained exceptional. It was our best quarterly performance outside of last year's second quarter when travel demand was really low. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT for all the marketing carriers. So just -- again, I'm just very, very proud of our employees. 
Now June was our most difficult month of the quarter. Our April and May outperformed previous years in all of our key operational metrics. And even with the customer volume increase, June was off to a solid start. Mid-month, we did run into a combination of technology issues, followed by weaker weather challenges across our entire network. 
And those introduced some extreme delays into the network, and it caused significant crew availability concerns as well as delays and cancellations that impacted our customers, and that dropped our OTP to 62.4% for June. And we need to and we will do better than that moving forward. 
As we move through July, weather is still a bit of a concern as is the overall tempo of the airport environment. But the entire industry is feeling the impact of those things, and that's reflected in the overall industry OTP thus far in July. 
We expect our operational reliability to continually improve from our June performance. We use planning models that require an adequate level of airplanes and people and facilities to run our schedules. As we entered into the second quarter, we had all those resources aligned and we were on track until roughly mid-June.
And so there are a couple of focus areas for the operation as we move forward. First, the passenger demand is very strong and our load factors going in and out of our large cities are 90-plus percent most days. And we're still ramping up the operation, and we have 16 fewer flight than we did in June of 2019, which for us means there are fewer ways to reaccommodate customers when we have delays or cancellations, while higher volumes and fewer reaccommodation options translate for us into a longer operating day. 
So we're adding staffing in several of our large cities that have additional resources to cover those longer operating days and reduce the need for a premium pay. We've increased our minimum starting pay to $15 an hour to better source applicants for those positions. And we're offering premium pay for our employees to pick up open shifts on their scheduled time-off just in the meantime. 
The second thing that we're focused on is sourcing flight instructors, so we can ensure that we can support the training needs for our pilots returning from extended time-off as well as our recurrent training needs as we continue to add flying to the network throughout this year and then set ourselves up for 2022.
It feels really good to finally be in a position where we can add flights and pick up our operating momentum. It was a bit messy as we throttled down our activity, and it doesn't surprise me that it's a bit messy as we're accelerating it. But our employees just navigate those -- through those things heroically. They have great hearts for our customers and for each other, and I'm just so proud and thankful for their efforts every day. 
And with that, Ryan, I think I'll turn it back over to you."

What we're seeing is I think we're seeing something very similar actually to what I'm hearing and reading from the other carriers as they report. But just to give you some context, roughly, call it, 30% of our passengers or so are business travelers and probably 35% of our revenues is generated by business travel. And I think that the opportunity for us, I think this kind of gets to your point or the answer to your question, we have a lot more opportunity to drive a lot more depth within the current accounts we have with GDS. So I think that you'll see that begin to drive up our Southwest business numbers, if you will. 
But very consistently, we're seeing about 5 points of improvement in the Southwest business bookings each month over the past 4 or 5 months. We said, I guess it was the first quarter call, Ryan, we said that we -- our expectation was Southwest business or business travel will be down about 50% by year-end. If you just kind of extrapolate where we are right now, we would beat that. I think our expectation would probably be at 50% by the end of this quarter and certainly beat that by the end of the year, assuming things keep going. 
So I'm not sure if we're behind our competitors or not, to be honest with you. I feel like going from down 88% to down 69% on the path towards down 50% by the end of the quarter is pretty much in line with the market. But I think we're going to see more and more penetration with the GDS implementations. And again, we just under-indexed significantly in these big accounts, so that's an opportunity for us."

And I think one could assume that they're smaller companies, maybe sole proprietors or what-have-you. But our frequent flyer credits, and there are just other inputs that we look at that would suggest that, that is a conservative number. 
So I agree with Tom. We're the largest airline in the country. We carry more people than any other airline. I think we carry more business travelers than any other airline. So I find it hard to believe that we're inconsistent with anybody else. But admittedly, we hear -- we hear the same numbers that you hear, and we just can't -- when out surveying people, we can't be for sure what their purpose of travel is. But our frequent flyers, those flight credits are down far less than 69%, which is some indication. 
Of course, it could be a businessperson who is traveling for personal reasons. We just don't know. But it's probably more information than you wanted, but I can't imagine that we're out of step with anybody else in the industry."

But Bob mentioned it in his remarks that he's been a part of this and he's been a part of it for a long, long time. 33 years is a long time. He's had a number of different executive jobs. So I think you all should just know that he's been a part of coming up with and defining our purpose and our vision and translating that into a strategy and he's been a huge part of the execution. 
But at the same time, what we've got to be careful here is the task of a leader is to have the wisdom to know what to change and what not to change. And at the same time, I need to -- selfishly, I need to empower him and get out of his way. So I had a good teacher in Herb Kelleher. He was Executive Chair for me. And I wasn't necessarily thinking at the time that, ""Okay, well, I need to learn from this because I'll do it someday."" But fortunately, I have lived through that. And I do have a good idea of what I need to do to support him. But Bob, it's really more of a question for you."

It's taken 2 of the 3 decades but we got there. But no, I'm just kidding. But yes, I think a couple of things.

But no, I'm just kidding. 
But yes, I think a couple of things. One, we -- at the end of the day, as the CEO, you cannot do it all yourself. It's all about the team and we have a wonderful team of leaders here. And I think we're both very passionate about focusing on that, developing our team, developing our leaders, developing the ""next generation"" of leaders and preparing people. And so I think that -- I feel like we're very similar in that way. 
Yes. In the same way that Gary invested in me and many others for decades, but I think at the passion point of mind to be able to continue to do that because it's all about not just what we can do as we have this change, it's about what we can do to set Southwest Airlines up for success for 20 and 30 and even more years. 
On the style front, in addition to that, I think our styles are, again, very similar. We're very collaborative. We love bringing the team into the conversation and the decisioning. If there's a difference, probably, I -- and this can be good and bad, I'm probably a little more of a driver, maybe a little more impatient sometimes. Again -- which is probably why a lot of my assignments over the years have been go do things, go get the [ Euro train ] integration underway and push through completion as an example. So that can be a benefit in terms of driving and getting things accomplished in our plan. 
But I also have to work on sometimes slowing down, being collaborative and just make sure we make wise decisions here as we -- as of course, we will. How we would approach the plan and our strategic plan, in particular? We're very similar. I think there -- as you know, we're very focused on things like GDS and modernizing the fleet. 
Plans change though. You complete a set of things and you roll into the next set of things, and you want to be very thoughtful about what those are. We want to be, again, collaborative with our team about developing that set of next strategic initiatives. And so we will work, as part of our '22 planning, to think about that next set of things. 
I mentioned this upfront, I'm focused around things that are just maybe part of what is an expectation today. So our customers expect us to work with them and engage with them and produce a customer experience that is maybe, again, terrific. Our employees are just terrific, but they expect a lot of things to be quick, delivered over mobile platforms, easy to resolve, even in an IROP situation. 
Our employees expect the same thing. They want it to be very easy to work with Southwest Airlines, manage their shifts off of their iPhone, for example. And so I'll be very focused on some of those things. The other -- and again, this is a focus that both Gary and myself and our whole team, I'm very focused on our diversity commitments. 
We laid some of that out next -- last year. We have things that we need to focus on. We, in particular, our diversity in our senior leadership group. And so you will likely hear me talking a lot about that. As Tom mentioned, we have a lot of focus in our sustainability commitments. 
And so plans change over time. They always do. The initiatives we have on the table right now are what I and Gary and others were involved in 10 years ago and so they're always going to shift. But we're going to make sound judgments. We're going to develop the team. We're going to stand by the principles that make Southwest Airlines great, our business model, our people balancing our results with our operations and with our customer experience. 
And so maybe a long-winded answer, but I think we have -- we're generally a lot of similarities in how we approach the business and the problems and our people."

I mentioned I was in Atlanta yesterday so you could see the hiring and labor complexity firsthand there. So I think you're -- multiple things, you're in a broad-based market with supply shortages. So there's just not enough people to fill the jobs that are open. I might -- the stat that I think I've heard it, we went into the pandemic with open -- a lot of open jobs here in the U.S. And I think we have had 9 million or 10 million folks exit the workforce at this point. 
So we all see the help wanted signs everywhere. So you're competing in a market that is just tougher. So as an example, we are getting fewer applications for open position than we are used to. So it's just going to take a lot of vigor around the focus on hiring. 
Some of the differences are regional. I would say they're more about how to triage critical positions. So we have places where it's more critical to the operation than others. For example, we are really -- we've got a full press on to hire on the Denver ramp as an example because there are needs there. 
We have full -- we have a full press to hire flight instructors because we have plenty of pipeline -- a pipeline of pilots we feel like but we need to get them trained. We have folks coming off of the ExTO, and it just takes time to train and get them back into the workforce. So there needs to rebuild our training capacity just like our hiring capacity. 
So I think I would tell you the -- I'm probably more focused on this being a broad-based problem in terms of just labor availability than a narrow issue in terms of a specific job. The biggest question to me, I think we're fighting our way through because we'll get through rebuilding, recruiting teams and training teams and that short term, those are short-term issues is, how long does this persist? Do we plan against this being a 3-month issue as the folks are really going to return to the workforce, for example, once school starts? Or are we planning against a multiyear issue where it's going to be folks coming back into the workforce very slowly? 
And that's a difficult question, which means you just have to be nimble in your planning, how we think about bringing aircraft into the schedule, which I'm very pleased we have the flexibility, how you think about planning your schedules and how you think about staffing your schedules. The last thing we want to do is put a schedule out there where we cannot staff. And so there's just -- there's a lot of focus on this. I will tell you, if it's not the #1 focus right now, it is 1A, which is getting -- getting our hiring in place and our staffing in place."

The thing I'd add is assuming you can get past the people constraint piece of it in terms of how we want to use the capacity. And by the way, I think back to Hunter's question, it seems to me we would take those aircraft, because we want to retire, you still -- you can retire. You got a -- it's NPV positive, all kind of stuff, you have a better customer experience that all works. So I don't think there's a fear or concern of us taking too much aircraft and being stuck, right? So we have plenty of flexibility. The ability to retire, the ability to retain and keep growing. But I guess what I'm really getting at is our ability to produce good ASMs and productive ASMs are going to be somewhat, in fact, largely dependent upon when does business traffic begin to come back, and let me explain why. The composition of our network, our point-to-point network, it's -- our principal around the point-to-point network has not changed with the pandemic. How that's been executed for the past year, it's been shifted a little bit just by virtue of the environment. 
But our philosophy is the very same. So we do want to get back to the pre-pandemic mix of direct versus connecting flights, call it, 75-25 historically. We're a little bit skewed off of that. It's probably, I don't know, Andrew, 72-28 or something like that. So we want to get that back. We also want to get back to our mix of short, medium and long haul flying, call it, rough terms 40-40-20, short, medium, long as percents. And right now, it's more like 30-40-30, because those short-haul flights, those are the business-driven flights. And the business traffic wasn't there. We needed to create the leisure capacity that came from short haul. So as business comes back, you'll begin to see us just reinstate that kind of flying.
So there are many, many productive uses of the capacity. And again, the capacity -- if the demand does not show up, we have the ability to retire 737s, 700s, right, and just continue to improve the fleet. So I think we got -- in fact, either Mike said this or Tammy said this or we've all said this, the flexibility we have on the upside of the downside is really positive. It's really strong."

That's 15% of our route system, as I recall, that we have reallocated from, call it, more business-oriented markets, i.e., short, to the longer, more leisure oriented. So I think that speaks somewhat to what you're describing. But the other thing I would comment on 2019, in 2019, we weren't close to providing the network that we wanted, because we were constrained in that scenario by the fleet. And so we're already trying to get back to where we were plus. And all of this is, as we've all said, it's all dependent upon demand materializing like we're thinking.

If I could just maybe sneak 1 more modeling type question shorter term in. Looking through the monthly revenue forecast, we see August step down a little bit from July. I think there's some holiday movement in there, as you mentioned, and perhaps second half of August is a little bit more back-to-school given your kind of south and southeast parts of your network. If that's right on the return to school driving a little bit less leisure demand, while corporate is still depressed, would it follow that September should also see a sequential step-down in performance versus August? Or are there other factors at play?"

I think that the -- first of all, I think that the calendar shift from 2 points from August and September is just that, it's a calendar shift. It doesn't really belie the underlying strength of the business. So August is performing well. So I'm not concerned about August. There are no red flags in August, but it does have the natural seasonality. The first half is strong leisure. The second half is back to school, and that's where the business traveling begins to kick in and pick up the slack and that kind of thing. So we're waiting to see that. We feel pretty good about that. 
In terms of September, we did something this year that was really creative. So I'm kind of smiling at Andrew right now because he and his team sorted this out and worked through it. But we had a 50th anniversary sale that was really all about driving leisure demand in the back half of September. September, call it, second week of September through November 3 or some such date, but it's basically trying to fill in upfront the leisure bookings early to secure a nice solid foundation book of business. And from that point forward throughout the rest of September and October, you're able to begin to manage just the remaining booking window, if you will. So that has worked really well.
In fact, the 50th anniversary sale, it was a 3-day sale. I think 2 of the 3 days, Andrew, were 2 of the top -- in fact #1 and #2 in terms of our history over 50 years of bookings, right? So this thing really worked. Point being, we have a very solid foundation of leisure bookings in place for September. I'm very curious to see what's going to happen with business travel post Labor Day. Everything we're sensing, feeling, hearing is suggesting that you're going to see it begin to come back. What I'm really encouraged by is, I got to be quick, I'm taking too much time, of the top 50 or so corporate travel accounts, 7 are professional services consulting firms, they're all traveling. The lockdowns are removed. So they are traveling, and that's a big deal for us, and that just begins to generate more and more. So I think it's beginning to pick up some steam. So I'm nonplussed by the August issue you raised. I don't think that's an issue. September, we've built a good solid book of leisure, and I feel good about where we are."

Savi, I can start, and I'm sure others will want to chime in here as well. But just to take you through our thought process here. As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impacts that we called out, our third quarter nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit sharing, would be forecast to trend in line or below '19 unit cost levels. So while most of these near-term cost pressures should be onetime or nonrecurring as we move beyond this ramp-up period, we have always really considered getting back to 2019 unit cost levels at sort of a point in time target. And we shared that sentiment with you, I know, before. 
As far as the cost base in 2019, we are -- or we were hearing extra employees, as you pointed out, due to the MAX grounding. However, when you think about that, the nominal cost of that was really overshadowed by the 7 points of capacity that we were unable to fly back in 2019 that caused the outsized inflation. So if you fast forward to where we are today, we have a lower overall headcount due to voluntary retirements, but just keep in mind, we've had 2 years of right inflation for our employees. And as we've already covered with you, we've recalled the vast majority of those employees from extended time off. The recomp will help us, of course, as we continue adding trips here in the third and the fourth quarter, but it does reduce the benefit from our voluntary leave program by about $50 million in both third quarter as well as fourth quarter.
And the other thing to consider is that we are now back to 2019 AS levels and we are building toward 2019 trip levels, as I pointed out earlier. So just -- so we'll have some noise here as we've already covered with you all. It's just not as clean as we would like as we're adding back in capacity. And we'll need to do some hiring as we've already covered with you all for our work -- for many of our work groups to support that trip growth in the second half and as we restore our network next year. 
But what I really wanted to get to is as we get back to restoring our network and we kind of get in a rhythm here, we should have more operating leverage as we bring back on more capacity. So I think that's a really key point for you all. We're just -- it's just a little messy here. But that is obviously our goal. Our goal is to scale as efficiently as we can as we restore our network. So I think, hopefully, that's helpful. We're going to be really focused on our productivity metrics like employees for aircraft, and we're going to all work together just to be as efficient as we can and really go back to more of our history of having very highly productive employees and that will be anchored around our point-to-point network and our all Boeing 737 fleet. So I feel like our competitive cost advantages are very much intact, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that we scale efficiently and offset inflationary pressures, which is not unique to Southwest, best we can."

But I'll try to just provide you just a couple of points, just to give you a little color. We do -- just to be clear, though, we do expect the current cost inflation and salary wages and benefits from our operational strain to be temporary. And here in the near term, we anticipate some ongoing cost pressures in other cost categories as we ramp up our flying and that's obviously like maintenance, airport and other operating costs. So there will be some costs that come back on as we add capacity as we recover. 
And then there will be some choppiness, too, as we bring back our flying. Just looking ahead to fourth quarter, as an example, our maintenance cost will be burdened more in fourth quarter due to just bringing the MAX 700s that Gary mentioned out of storage and back into service. And we're realizing airport cost pressures as well. And then the inflation we've already covered. So again, I think it really goes back to as we -- as we scale up, we'll have more operating leverage and we'll -- I think the key here is to get back to those 2019 productivity levels. So again, a lot of moving parts. And as we get through the year, have more visibly into next year, we'll be prepared to give you all a better guidance there."

We have -- I think we have a really good track record. And what you saw for us last year, we came out with commitments that were really around diversity, in particular, racial diversity in our senior leadership group. So I think what you find is that as you look at our broad employee base, we are very diverse. So particularly on the front line, I think I would -- my guess would be that our diversity in our overall workforce, particularly the front line, for the most part matches what you would see here in the United States. I think we're in really good shape there. But as you move sort of up the leadership chain here, and again, I'm thinking about our senior leadership, it is hard to argue that we don't have some work to do. While we have terrific leaders, we have a terrific pipeline of leaders, and it's really just about making sure that as we think about our succession planning and our long-term pipelines that those are diverse. We -- our hiring practices focus on thinking about diversity as a component, where do we recruit, how do we think about hiring and how we choose to hire.
And then, again, because if you just took our senior leadership group as an example, where we do have some work to do, I would argue, and that was part of our goal stated last year, it's a long succession pipeline to move from a kind of an entry-level leadership position, ultimately into a senior leadership position. That may be a decade-long process. So it's very focused on, to be honest, the processes we use to think about how we hire and how we recruit and where we hire now and where we recruit. And then how we think about just improving our diversity in senior leadership. And then again, that depends on the pipeline. We're looking at things like just classic sponsorship and mentorship programs, which we all do. And so again, I wouldn't take that as ""Wow, we have a big issue."" I think we -- historically, you're right. We have, I think, produced really good results. But there is improvement that we think we need to focus on there.

The -- only with the benefit of hindsight, by the way, because the schedule was very well planned. It was very well coordinated between our financial objectives, our commercial opportunity and our operational capabilities. It was very well planned. It was planned based on our historic modeling of what kind of resources we need for what kind of activity, which we have 50 years of experience doing. And we included some cushion, for lack of a better word. So turn times as an example were actually planned to be higher than what we would otherwise expect. And in hindsight, there are some elements of our plan that were too tight. That being 1 of them at some of our locations. If you were listening to the analyst call, Mike mentioned his 8 largest airports. So weather, we factored in weather as best we could, and the weather was more spring-like in June, in particular, than normal. And so that kind of whacked us. That's out of our control. Technology are one-off things. And those are the 2 headline issues for June. 
If we get into July, I think we're in the middle of the pack most days, Mike. So we're not first in the industry. We're not last. So the industry is simply operating slower. And I think we want to be -- we can see some elements of where that's manifesting. What we do know is we have a different network than 2 years ago. We have a much higher proportion of consumers traveling. That has translated into much heavier baggage loads and also buying itineraries that are more complex, i.e., connecting, which also translates into more connecting bags. So we can see things today that we would not have known when we put the schedule into effect. I can assure you, we'll be factoring that in prospectively. So that's the 1 very tangible thing that I've seen so far. And again, you've got experts in the room here that may want to chime in. 
But the overall allegation that we were understaffed is not true. That is incorrect. Meaning that it wasn't understaffing that's led to delays. The problem becomes -- the delays, whatever the reason for it is, puts pressure on the staffing, because the days are longer or as Mike was describing, how flight crews end up diverted and in the wrong place and out a position and so do airplanes. So getting the airline back on the tracks obviously is job 1. But our people have done a phenomenal job. They're working very hard. Mark -- Mike described some of the challenges in the environment. It's just -- I blame it on the pandemic. It's messy. It's messy coming in. It's certainly messy coming out. Anything you guys want to add?"

So our point-to-point network is it's a different model than most other airlines out there. And the way that we are able to absorb significant events in that kind of a model is we would generally cancel a flight, get the airline back on time and then we would reaccomodate customers through other alternatives that we had. And we do that very successfully year in and year out. The biggest change that I think we faced this year with 2020 hindsight is we can't absorb those significant events as efficiently this year as we did in the past, because we don't have as much frequency in our network today that we did yesterday, but we will in the future.
And so what that is causing us to do is to run those flights a little bit later, and it extends the operating day. And so that's really the crux of the issue. And then the salve for that is as we grow the network and add flights back, that solves itself. And then also, we're going to come into a period of time where we don't have the thunderstorms and these pop-up weather events that we do here in June and July. So I feel like the worst part of all that is behind us. And given all the information that we had, as Gary said, we were planned appropriately well. Just not able to absorb those significant events like we could in the past. Saying all of that, we're roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of dealing with those things today."

And I can understand from a customer's perspective maybe how some of that frustration builds up. But just -- we have no tolerance for customers to take out that frustration on our people or anyone else for that matter and especially if those are in physically threatening or assaulting manners.

I think in the town hall that President Biden had yesterday, the report was that of all the recent deaths, and all of this is unfortunate, I think 99.5% of the folks were not vaccinated.

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. After 5 quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares and revenues, and obviously, that was very encouraging. It would have been even better but for the Delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August. Of course, the bounce in revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation, though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken. 
So I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential and especially considering that business travel is far from recovering to 2019 levels, and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people, and we've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time. 
And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances. I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority.

I'll touch on a few items before I turn it over to Tammy. The transition continues to go really well. As part of the leadership changes announced last month, our full senior team now reports to me, and they are the finest leaders in the industry and it's an honor to work with them. 
We're working together on long-term priorities and specific plans for '22 and we will share those in December. But one of my highest priorities is being with our people, and it's energizing to see their heart and their dedication and witnessed the incredible job that they do every single day despite the challenging operating environment. They are my heroes and it's an honor to stand beside them as we emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of our opportunities. 
As Gary said, we had terrific momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, especially leisure demand with traffic actually above 2019 levels. We were on a good trend on the corporate side as well. It was just off of a lower bottom. But resurging COVID cases cost the quarter about $300 million, and that aside, the quarter would have been solidly profitable. As cases have come down and subsided, booking trends have recovered nicely on both the leisure and the business front, and booking trends for the holidays are in line with 2019. As you know from the release, the key headwind for the fourth quarter, aside from just inefficiencies as we continue to ramp up is a significant increase in jet fuel prices. 
I do want to touch on the issues we experienced beginning October 8. Our challenges started with a widespread ATC ground stop and ground delay program that effectively shut down our Florida operation from that afternoon through the end of the day. Mike is going to talk more about this, but that caused a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position and then that took several days to recover. And as a result, we inconvenienced thousands of customers and we further challenged our stellar employees. And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees. We just did not live up to your expectations. 
Before this, we were actually seeing very positive trends in our operational performance. And the key to continued improvement is getting staffed and continuing to invest in our operation, and we are absolutely laser-focused on both of those. Looking forward, our immediate goals are really basic: number one, to bulk up our staffing. We made tremendous progress. That remains short of what is needed, especially when we dip into staffing reserves. And therefore, we've continued to modestly trim our fourth and first quarter schedules. 
Second, get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency. The ramp-up of the business and the fits and starts caused by the COVID waves have made both of those very tough, as has the lack of network Third, restore our customer service advantage, which starts with our people and the unrivaled hospitality that they deliver. And again, that is tough in the current operating environment; and fourth, continue to focus on our people and our culture. Our people are our advantage, and the last 20 months has been challenging to them collectively and individually. Our culture has sustained us through the pandemic, and it will power our advantage as we emerge from the pandemic. And while we have short-term issues to manage, I'll just tell you, I am very positive about our long-term opportunities. 
I'd also like to talk briefly and highlight our sustainability plans. Earlier this week, we announced a set of specific 10-year plans in support of our overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. It's important to our people, our customers and above all, our planet that we are good stewards. As we grow over the next decade, that growth is planned with no incremental carbon emissions as compared to 2019 and carbon emissions per available seat mile falling by at least 20% by 2030 as compared to 2019. This progress occurs through a number of initiatives, but namely, a commitment to the more fuel-efficient Boeing 730 MAX 7 (sic) [ Boeing 737 MAX 7 ] and 737 MAX 8 and accelerated retirements of our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft; a commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030;  and in the near term, a carbon offset program that partners with our customers who are passionate about this. And our offset program will be the only 1 that provides both loyalty points and a dollar-for-dollar match. 
Above all, I'm just really proud of the work team that has done the work to pull this plan together so quickly, and I'm especially proud that our plan and our commitments are specific and they are time-bound. 
To wrap up, while we made considerable progress from a year ago and are pleased with the recent improvement in travel demand trends, it is clear that 2022 will be another transition year in the pandemic recovery. The restoration of the network is a top priority in '22 and '23, but it will take time and it will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of business travel and our ability to staff. Even with the anticipated cost headwinds in '22 related to significant inflation and productivity shortfalls, our primary goals next year are to deliver increased operational reliability, generate solid profits and margins and restore and grow the route network while reducing our carbon emissions intensity. And I look forward to sharing a lot more about all this and our '22 plans at our Investor Day on December 8. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy."

On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter or $0.73 per diluted share. And this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million or a $0.23 loss per diluted share. 
Our third quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by the stepback in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom line came in above expectations and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today, and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began. 
Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began, and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profit. 
Third quarter available seat miles and nonfuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance. 
We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had 4 points of notable cost pressure in the third quarter, and these 4 points were primarily due to premium pay as well as other ramp-up costs. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight schedules to provide more staffing cushion. The reduction in premium pay provides a roughly 2-point unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter. 
Our 2 largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary wages and benefits and airport costs. These 2 categories alone are driving 3 to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-2-year basis. First, on salary wages and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is a tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year-end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation. 
Second on airport costs. By year-end, we will have 18 new airports in our network. So our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. Our fourth quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years. 
Also in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program and lower productivity than historical norms. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near term and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network. 
Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth quarter bottom line outlook is trending better than third quarter except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly $120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter. And underlying revenue trends have picked up which is encouraging, even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment. 
Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise. 
Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at Investor Day. And I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. So with that, I will turn it over to Andrew."

I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To sum up our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery",697,"Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To sum up our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery trend we experienced from March through July. The impact of the Delta variant began impacting revenues around the beginning of August. And we saw slowing and inconsistent pass-through traffic and bookings, along with an increase in trip cancellations through about mid-September. 
In terms of overall revenue loss, September bore the brunt of the impact, and we saw that across all geographies and for both leisure and business travel. As with prior waves, when we have a stepdown in demand, especially with the slide we saw in business demand in September, yields are tough to manage. However, we had better success in terms of maintaining load factors in the low 80% range for the third quarter. 
And the silver lining is that the overall impact from the Delta variant, estimated to be $300 million in Q3 and another $100 million in Q4, was less severe than what we experienced from prior COVID waves. As you may recall, operating revenues stalled down in the negative 60% range from September through February. So travel demand is much more resilient today than this time last year. 
While there's a lingering impact to fourth quarter operating revenues from the Delta variant, revenue trends have improved substantially since mid-September. Trip cancellations have decreased and stabilized, and we've seen an increase in bookings across all geographies for both leisure and business. Operating revenues are currently expected to improve sequentially throughout the fourth quarter. 
The [ booking ] curve has normalized and bookings thus far for the holidays in November, December are healthy and supported by improving leisure demand. In fact, our overall booking curve is currently trending in line with 2019 levels for the holidays, which is encouraging. In terms of business travel trends, our managed business revenues were down in the lower 60% range in both July and August year-over-2 year, but it took a step back in September to down 73%. 
However, this trend has reversed as we are experiencing steady improvements in business bookings thus far in October. Based on current trends, we expect managed business revenues to continue improving modestly in November and December and end at down roughly 60% by year-end. This estimate is less optimistic than what we previously shared prior to the impact from the Delta variant as many corporations pushed back their campus openings until after the new year. But we remain cautiously optimistic about overall business travel improvement throughout year-end, and we believe there is some pent-up business demand and there's a chance that we see a pick-up at a faster clip as we get into early 2022. 
We are now live on all 3 of our planned GDS platforms, Amadeus, Travelport and Sabre. We have now removed the friction from businesses working with Southwest, and we have a full array of distribution channels that they can choose from. Early indications from our GDS launch as we are gaining incremental volume through the GDS channel and seen a great response for Southwest fares through the GDS. As expected, we are also seeing some channel shift from our Direct Connect channel to GDS, which is perfectly okay and sets us up for broader appeal to corporations through the channel of their choice. 
Turning to our new markets. They continue to develop well and overall performed in line with expectations in the third quarter. Hawaii markets were impacted more severely as travel warnings were issued against travel to the islands. However, all of these growth markets have shown improvement recently in line with the broad-based improvement we are seeing across the rest of the network. 
And lastly, our Rapid Rewards program continued to show progress in the third quarter with other revenues up 10% on a year-over-2 year basis. We remain convinced about the growth opportunities of Rapid Rewards and our co-brand portfolio which we recently expanded in terms of our credit card offerings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
31726,694554660,2409204,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Well, thanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone, on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally. It's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services",950,"Well, thanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone, on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally. It's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services like wheelchairs and concessions, match requirements for customers and our people and still have a very challenging supply chain and hiring environment. And all of those things are impacting the travel experience for our customers and for our employees. 
Our third quarter operational results reflect that environment. And we have a number of employees making significant sacrifices to help us navigate through it, and I am extremely grateful to them for their support to engage in a very difficult arena. And they're just special warriors. 
We finished the quarter with a 71.7% on-time performance. And while that was [ sixth ] in the industry, those delays were generally less than 45 minutes, and our on-time performance at 60 minutes was 90.4%, which was fourth in the industry. We did have our best third quarter bag handling performance in our history with, of course, the exception of last year when our bag volumes were slightly less than half of this year. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. So while I am not satisfied with our overall results and we can and we will do better, our people worked very, very hard to take care of our customers. 
As we move forward, we are focused on a couple of targeted actions. First, we know that our on-time performance has been impacted all summer by a combination of high load factors and especially going into and out of our largest cities and the reduction in frequencies from our typical network. In fact, our largest cities experienced full airplanes coming in and out nearly every day, and they had much more extensive connecting activities, including bag volumes than what we had seen pre COVID. 
And those activities took more time to complete than we had scheduled for our turns. And given the heavy load factors, we tended to hold the flight for connections, given the reduction in frequencies and our inability to re-accommodate the customers. And that, of course, put pressure on our on-time performance, and that averaged roughly 66% from July through mid-August. So as the customer volumes declined mid-August through September and those activities lessened, our on-time performance improved to 80%. And that was a welcome improvement, but again, it was below our historical performance in that period. 
So in the near term, we have focused hiring efforts to increase staffing at the airports to give us more resources to handle those activities when our load factors increase over the holiday periods. And we're also better using our staffing tools to more accurately match our scheduled shift with those activities. So I expect both those additional resources and more focused staffing execution will boost our on-time performance going forward. And then for future schedules, we are looking at scheduling opportunities to move ground times around the places where it's most needed to keep our flat lines on time as long as this connection activity is expected. 
In a second -- in a separate but still related issue from on-time performance is balancing our schedule with our crew resources. All of our employees should expect to be able to bid their shift, they show up to work and it'd be the same as what they bid and then they get to go home as planned. And I've mentioned before that those staffing plans were based on various models that have assumptions in them for things like vacation and sick leave, open time or shift pickup rate and the time it takes to fill open positions. 
And while we had adjusted those assumptions going into the summer to provide more staffing cushion, they just weren't enough to match the reality of the environment that we were operating through. And that was particularly impactful to our flight crews. Our sick trends were much higher than expected and our open time pickup rates were also impacted. And those were more pronounced on weekends, and we were routinely exhausting our reserves to cover those impacted flights. And that's what causes the crew reroutes and the unplanned overtime and the unscheduled overnight and all of that impacts our people. So it's a spiral that we just have to break. 
And to do that, we've adjusted our fourth quarter flight schedules downward as previously announced. And we have new-hire flight attendants along with pilots returning from extended leaves that are coming back online in the fourth quarter. And those actions will boost our crew reserves to 20% for our pilots and around 26% for our flight attendants. We'll also expect our sick trends, which include COVID impact to begin to decline as this Delta variant begins to wane. 
So in summary, we continue to add staffing, and we've made schedule adjustments to both improve our on-time performance and add more staffing cushion to navigate through our current environment. And as our environment and our staffing and scheduling balance begin to stabilize, we'll be in a good position to begin restoring our network frequencies during 2022. 
So in closing, we've had our share of operational headwinds this year. I know the environment is full of stressors and distractions. And I just want to express my continued thanks to all those employees that have made significant sacrifices to take care of our customers and to support their co-Hearts. I know they have tremendous pride in our company, and the company is tremendously proud of them. And with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back to you."

Obviously, the -- we'll want to make sure that the earnings supports that. We'll want to make sure that the balance sheet supports that, and then we'll want to balance that against our capital plans. So I think the litmus test that we've used for decades, we would continue to use. In the old days, when we were so high growth, we had a fairly modest dividend and used share repurchases sparingly because we were investing in the company and in growth. 
I think everybody in this room is very hopeful that, that's what we've got in front of us. I think we're -- I pushed a little too hard there in the third quarter with capacity, but the encouraging thing is demand is there. We've got a line of sight to airplanes. I think what I mentioned in the second quarter, we've got airport capacity. And right now, our constraint is just making sure that we have the people resources to balance all that. 
So that's going to be a priority, repairing the balance sheet, at least to a degree. Tammy's nodding her head here, is certainly an objective for us. And you got 2 levers. One is paying down debt, the other 1 is generating earnings so both of those work in tandem. But it will -- I think our long history of returning or having returns to shareholders, it has not changed. It will just have to obviously feather in with this very different environment that we're finding ourselves in and an interesting growth opportunity over the next 5 years.

But Mike, his team and technology just rolled out some technology this week, in fact, that will help address what you're describing. But the 10-minute turn, Jamie, my first flight on Southwest was in 1972, and there were 2 other passengers on the flight. It does not take long to turn an airplane in 10 minutes when there's 3 customers. 
I asked Lamar Muse when I first became CEO about who was the genius that designed the open seating concept. And he very colorfully told me that, ""You don't need to assign seats when the airplanes are empty."" So the passengers are the gating factor with the turn. It's rarely the bags. The more connecting bags you have, obviously, that calculus can change. 
But I'll tell you 1 other funny old story and these all predate me, although I was a customer in the 1970s and experienced this. We actually would push the airplane before everybody was in their seat, much less buckled in with a seatbelt. So all kind of quaint stories now. But I think you're probably more interested in what we can do realistically. So Mike, do you want to talk about those targets you have?"

But I think we do focus on the turn and we break it down into different components. And you start just with the different components, the offload and then the clean and then the loading backup. And there are several things that make the turn longer today than they were back in the days when you remember the 10-minute turn. 
And so one of the big items right now is the ADA and wheelchairs and making sure that we have a wheelchair accommodations for people. That probably adds 3 or 4 or 5 minutes just trying to get people loaded on the airplane. And a lot of times, they are magically healed getting on -- from the slide, we don't need them getting off. But when they do need them getting off, it'd actually add several minutes again. So I think just the wheelchair process is probably adding 5 to 10 minutes of that in a turn. 
The second thing that you have is just more people are bringing bags on the airplane. And we've got the Sky -- the new overhead bins on the new airplanes, trying to get all those things stored. That takes a little bit longer than normal. And those are really the 2 primary things. The third thing is back when I first started at Southwest Airlines, we -- our ops agents were at the door of the airplane, and so any coordination they had to do with the cockpit was right there at the door of the airplane. 
Today, depending on, you probably walk down some of the jet bridges, they are long walks and our ops agents sometimes have to make that trip 2 or 3 times. And that's one of the things what Gary was talking about, we just rolled out some technology that will allow us to have a mobile platform and get our ops agents back closer to the door of the airplane. So that will help also."

And so the depth markets are primarily business-oriented markets. So we expect to, with the pace of business travel return, bring in those depth markets over our next year. Those same depth markets are the ones that also facilitate recovery, the day-to-day recovery that Mike was talking about. And our March through summer schedules as we anticipate seeing a step change in that level of density and depth in our network. We won't be fully restored again for over a year, but the part which really appeals to business travelers and helps micro recovery, we expect to see substantial progress from March through the end of summer."

So given the kind of turmoil of the Delta variant, it's really hard to be conclusive of the trends. We can see clearly though it is incremental, the shift we had planned for from our direct channels to these indirect channels. 
However, to give you a little bit of context, some of our largest corporations actually use all 3, so they're using Southwest [indiscernible] they're using our Direct Connect and now they're using GDS. And they use them for different populations and travel purposes. So the amount that's going through each of those 3 channels really depends on the population of who's traveling in that company right now. So it's hard to make definitive statements about what the overall shift will be when we're kind of done and dusted here as business travel finishes out its ramp-up. But right now, we see it's clearly incremental and we certainly plan on our business case for a substantial amount of shift."

I can start, Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have.

I can start, Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have. But yes, just kind of picking up from where we are here in the third quarter, our CASM-Ex was up about 3.5% and that was on a year-over-year 2 basis. And so clearly, we've got some ramp-up cost pressures here currently. And as I said earlier, that was about 4 points and that related to premium pay and ramp-up costs. 
So if you adjust for that impact, our third quarter CASM-Ex would have been slightly below third quarter 2019 on capacity that's down about 2%. So we've taken some cost-cutting measures here that we've implemented during the pandemic, and that's namely the voluntary retirement program and our extended leave program. And while those had substantial savings this year, the benefit is certainly temporary as all those employees were -- will be back here by year-end. 
And of course, as you know, we've shared that we're hiring a substantial number of employees. So we've got a goal to hire 5,000 new employees by year-end to replace many of those who left. So the point being is the cost reductions that we had during the pandemic, those will come back as capacity comes back. So that puts us at a much different point in the ramp-up than most of our competitors who still have capacity down much more. 
So we've talked about our 18 new cities and Hawaii investment. So we've allocated capacity here and that has come from pulling down our short- and medium-haul flying. So many of our costs here are back online, and I just want to point out again, we're staffing back up. And our network is very different from what it was pre pandemic. So that's kind of where we are today. 
And then we've also experienced several years of wage rate inflation from where we were in 2019. And as I covered earlier, we've got inflation in airports and pretty much across the board. So when you add to that the lower productivity we're experiencing from some of the behavior changes that we've talked about in this really tough operating environment, point being the environment is just different here. 
So kind of getting to your question, as we move forward, the main thing we want to focus on here is regaining our historical productivity edge. And clearly, the biggest thing is gain operating leverage through restoring the majority of our pre-pandemic network. And so I know that was kind of a long-winded answer there but there are just a lot of moving parts here. So we're going to be focused on improving our productivity as we move forward. But I think the biggest question mark I have right now is just what is going to be the extent of the inflationary pressures that we're feeling."

There's just all kinds of fits and starts in the business and different behaviors. And so you've got extra cost and inefficiency that comes through the network moving around. We've had schedules. We put them back. You had inefficiencies that have come through just hiring. We're staffing. It takes a while to get people through training. We're still behind. It takes a while for those folks to become productive. So you've got cost inefficiencies there. 
We had changes in behavior. I think those are largely COVID-driven. So we have, obviously, direct COVID poles or people. They're literally pulled off, can't work because of a COVID contact. We have excess sick leave as compared to normal. We have more folks on leaves as compared to normal. That's likely due to connected to bringing folks back from those extended leaves earlier than they had planned. So there's all kinds of stuff that is in there, and it's hard to tease apart exactly what the value is of each. 
So I'm with Tammy, job 1 is to stabilize all of that and then work to get ourselves back to pre-pandemic levels of productivity and efficiency and then from then, work on cost past that. But job 1 is to get back -- to wring all this out and back to the productivity that we had prior to COVID."

As we get the pandemic behind us, I, for one, think that, that will revert back to the mean and will trend and be and achieve prior productivity rates.

And we just took more people per trip, and so we immediately lowered trips from October through the end of the year. So just the level of capacity versus staffing was the initial issue. 
The second is the day-to-day recovery is more difficult when you have fewer options for re-accommodation, whether that's re-accommodating the customer, the crew or even the airplane to get it where that needs to be that night. And so bringing back that density, we've identified as the #1 thing that will help our day-to-day operations recover more easily when there are things that are exogenous shocks from weather or something else that allows us to recover. 
And so getting that back is going to be what we're going to be using our aircraft for over at least the next year and kind of in our network that was preexisting in 2019 will come to look a lot like what we have at the end of next summer, at the end of next year. That core part that operated very well and produced good results will start to look a whole lot similar. It takes a while to get there but that's what we'll be using the aircraft for versus, say, growth of breadth options, which we used during the pandemic."

But I don't think that it's so much a stage length, long haul versus short haul as it is more of a tilt towards leisure markets.

But a lot of our traditional business markets are the high-frequency short haul and we've thinned those out. So I think it's more the -- Andrew, the leisure business that we've adjusted now and we want to go back to restoring, which will be more short-haul, more business-oriented, which beefs up the backbone and helps with recoverability. 
So I don't know if there's a learning that we've had. I think actually, things are playing out the way we thought. But we're all anxious now that demand has recovered. I mean, that's an encouraging thing here, is now we're in a position where we can sort of pursue our strategy. It's playing out like we hoped. And we want to keep the new markets we added.

I mean, our network folks and our operational analytics folks are on top of all this stuff. They understand what we're doing, and then obviously, they understand what we have done to ourselves if we back off frequencies and depth. Obviously, it's going to be tougher to recover our customers and move our crews around. So we knew all that. 
I think the 2 learnings are -- again, we've talked about this a lot. We depended on some hiring to get staffed to support that network and it was just tough to get there. So by the time we were ready to fly, for example, the summer, we just weren't staffed to the point that we thought we would be. And the second learning really was how important the margin is, whether it's crews or around operations but I think especially crews. 
And as we had lower-margin things like reserves and all that, the operation is just -- it deteriorates faster as you eat up that margin that you've got, especially on the crew side. So to me, really the learning is on just how important it is, Mike's talked about this, to have that margin in the crew network, especially as you operate. And then again, in a thinner network with lower frequencies, as you have to use a part of that margin to move crews around and those kinds of things, it's just not there. So to me, the learnings were really more there, the importance of staffing than they were on the network design."

So that's just where we all started. Southwest is a terrific company, a terrific employer, terrific benefits, and so we do not struggle to get applicants. 
The applicant rates are a little below normal, which is to be expected given the number of open jobs. But no, we've not struggled to get applicants. I think the issues have probably been a couple of things. One, we spent 18 months or a little bit less hiring no one, I mean, basically, no one. In fact, we kind of dismantled the hiring machine and folks that work there and put them into other parts of the business. So once you decide to hire, which for us was probably April, you'd have to -- you have to decide and then you have to rebuild the team that actually works on all that. 
So by the time we really got to moving, it's July or August of this year before you could really have new folks back into serving -- to working and serving the airline. You also have to rebuild your training. But I think overall, again, it's a tough hiring environment but we are not struggling to get people. It is more competitive than ever. And it's especially competitive in our more entry-level jobs, for example, ramp -- on the ramp in airports and it's more competitive in certain parts of the country, like in Denver, for example. 
But no, we're not struggling to find people. We just need -- we need a lot and it's a competitive market, and it takes a while to get them from the hiring -- from the point of hiring to the point of actually being at work. We are using all kinds of new techniques we had not used in the past, instant interviews, instant offers, contingent offers where somebody goes into training ahead of their -- the required things like drug testing and background checking, those kinds of things. So no, I think I'm optimistic we just have a lot to do, trying to hire over 5,000 this fall and 8,000 next year."

But Alison, there's just -- there's no way to manage through a pandemic other than when the demand is cut by 98%, it would be foolish to fly the same schedule. So that schedule has served us well. It's something that we're very enthused about going forward. Now we very quickly and happily shifted to a need to go back and restore some depth in the network and that will be very, very welcome.

And if you don't mind, I'm just going to give you 2 minutes on what our objectives are here. Number one, we are -- and this somewhat ties in with Mary's question, we want this pandemic to end, so we certainly want to do everything that we can to encourage people to get vaccinated. I, for one, believe that, that is the path and that's the path that we're promoting. We have tried to encourage people to get vaccinated and further with incentives as opposed to using a more punitive approach as an example by charging employees if they're unvaccinated. So we're not doing the latter. We're doing the former, which is to try to encourage. So I think that's important as a background here. 
Second, our objective is to take care of our people in every way that we can in terms of their safety, in terms of their health, in terms of their job security. I think everyone should get vaccinated. However, I respect other views and especially when you consider how much information there is out there and pretty much any view you want to find support for, you can, and that has to obviously be confusing for people. So I don't feel that it's up to me to force people to get vaccinated. 
So I think that's important in answering your question that you know that those are 2 of our objectives. As a practical matter, we've got important trips with -- for our customers coming up in this quarter, in other words, the holidays. The last thing I want is our people distracted with something like this vaccine mandate. The last thing I want is for people to fear that they won't be able to work or have a job. And so we simply put that to rest. And it ties in -- so that objective, I'm sure you would readily recognize. 
But fourthly, which ties into that, we are a government contractor. We have been for decades. It is important to us in a variety of ways. And number one, we serve the military with charters; and number two, we're part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet which, as an example, just helped with Afghan refugees. So those are important to us. In addition to that, they're our largest customer. We carry the mail, we carry a number of government employees as passengers under this contract. 
So we're going to do everything that we can to maintain that contract. And we didn't ask for the mandate but we got it. So -- and the order is from the White House. So all of the agencies that we actually contract with, they're getting direction which is very general from the White House. And as that direction evolves, we evolve with it. And I think what -- again, just to tie in Mary's question, all I was trying to communicate to everyone is that we are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated. What we are trying to do is whatever we need to do to comply with the executive order so we can maintain our government contractor status. 
And if that means that we can do that and not force people off the job in December, that's why we -- this is an evolving process, working with the government in terms of what they expect. And very clearly, we want our employees to know that nobody is going to lose their job on December 9 if we're not perfectly in compliance. So it is a work in progress, and we're going to continue working in good faith to meet the requirements of the executive order. 
But I've already said and I'm sure you've heard that we're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated. How we work through the people that don't get vaccinated or don't seek an accommodation, we're going to have to figure out and we're working with the government on that. But we are not going to fire anybody. It makes no sense that we would not respect that and find some way to work with our people on that. And that's what we're determined to do is get the right balance between taking care of our people and maintaining our government contractor status."

And one of the examples offsite that he gave was say there is a testing regimen put in place. He said that potentially, you guys could have a lot of last-minute -- he didn't say you specifically. Airlines could have a lot of last-minute cancellations as people tested positive and so forth. So I just would like to get your thoughts on that.

So they have made that clear. We are very well aligned with the White House direction on all of that. 
So again -- and Dawn, I would just say, my duty is to take care of Southwest Airlines. My duty is to take care of our people and our customers, and we are not going to let this disrupt any of our customers' travel especially during the busy holiday season. With respect to accommodations, this is something that is long-standing within the company. It is a function that we have in Linda's department, and Linda, you're welcome to speak to this. But we have a team of experts who know what the rules are and know how to apply them in terms of medical or religious accommodations. I believe it's Title VII for religious and the ADA for medical. 
So it's not anything new and they're expert at it. What we are trying to do right now is to see what accommodation requests we get so that we can ensure that we're consistent in terms of who we accept and who we deny. Obviously, we're trying to work with our people here and take good care of them. 
In terms of encouragement, we are encouraging people to get vaccinated, period. We -- there's nothing new with that. I've been doing that since the vaccine came out, and nothing has changed there.

Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. After 5 quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares and revenues, and obviously, that was very encouraging. It would have been even better but for the Delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August. Of course, the bounce in revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation, though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken.
So I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential and especially considering that business travel is far from recovered to 2019 levels, and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people, and we've gone from not enough to do, to too much to do in a very short period of time. 
And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances. I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority.

I'll touch on a few items before I turn it over to Tammy. The transition continues to go really well. As part of the leadership changes announced last month, our full senior team now reports to me, and they are the finest leaders in the industry and it's an honor to work with them.  
We're working together on long-term priorities and specific plans for '22 and we will share those in December. But one of my highest priorities is being with our people, and it's energizing to see their heart and their dedication and witnessed the incredible job that they do every single day despite the challenging operating environment. They are my heroes and it's an honor to stand beside them as we emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of our opportunities.
As Gary said, we had terrific momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, especially leisure demand with traffic actually above 2019 levels. We were on a good trend on the corporate side as well. It was just off of a lower bottom. But resurging COVID cases cost the quarter about $300 million, and that aside, the quarter would have been solidly profitable. As cases have come down and subsided, booking trends have recovered nicely on both the leisure and the business front, and booking trends for the holidays are in line with 2019. As you know from the release, the key headwind for the fourth quarter, aside from just inefficiencies as we continue to ramp up is a significant increase in jet fuel prices. 
I do want to touch on the issues we experienced beginning October 8. Our challenges started with a widespread ATC ground stop and ground delay program that effectively shut down our Florida operation from that afternoon through the end of the day. Mike is going to talk more about this, but that caused a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position and then that took several days to recover. As a result, we inconvenienced thousands of customers and we further challenged our stellar employees. And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees. We just did not live up to your expectations.  
Before this, we were actually seeing very positive trends in our operational performance. And the key to continued improvement is getting staffed and continuing to invest in our operation, and we are absolutely laser-focused on both of those. Looking forward, our immediate goals are really basic: number one, to bulk up our staffing. We made tremendous progress. That remains short of what is needed, especially when we dip into staffing reserves. And therefore, we've continued to modestly trim our fourth and first quarter schedules.
Second, get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency. The ramp-up of the business and the fits and starts caused by the COVID waves have made both of those very tough, as has the lack of network depth. Third, restore our customer service advantage, which starts with our people and the unrivaled hospitality that they deliver. And again, that is tough in the current operating environment. And fourth, continue to focus on our people and our culture. Our people are our advantage, and the last 20 months has been challenging to them collectively and individually. Our culture has sustained us through the pandemic, and it will power our advantage as we emerge from the pandemic. And while we have short-term issues to manage, I'll just tell you, I am very positive about our long-term opportunities.
I'd also like to talk briefly and highlight our sustainability plans. Earlier this week, we announced a set of specific 10-year plans in support of our overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. It's important to our people, our customers and above all, our planet that we are good stewards. As we grow over the next decade, that growth is planned with no incremental carbon emissions as compared to 2019 and carbon emissions per available seat mile falling by at least 20% by 2030 as compared to 2019. 
This progress occurs through a number of initiatives, but namely, a commitment to the more fuel-efficient Boeing 730 MAX 7 (sic) [ Boeing 737 MAX 7 ] and 737 MAX 8 and accelerated retirements of our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft; a commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030; and in the near term, a carbon offset program that partners with our customers who are passionate about this. And our offset program will be the only one that provides both loyalty points and a dollar-for-dollar match. Above all, I'm just really proud of the work team that has done the work to pull this plan together so quickly, and I'm especially proud that our plan and our commitments are specific and they are time-bound.  
To wrap up, while we've made considerable progress from a year ago and are pleased with the recent improvement in travel demand trends, it is clear that 2022 will be another transition year in the pandemic recovery. The restoration of the network is a top priority in '22 and '23, but it will take time and it will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of business travel and our ability to staff. Even with the anticipated cost headwinds in '22 related to significant inflation and productivity shortfalls, our primary goals next year are to deliver increased operational reliability, generate solid profits and margins and restore and grow the route network while reducing our carbon emissions intensity. 
And I look forward to sharing a lot more about all this and our '22 plans at our Investor Day on December 8. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy."

On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter or $0.73 per diluted share. And this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million or a $0.23 loss per diluted share.
Our third quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by the step back in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom line came in above expectations and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. 
This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today, and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began.  
Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their warrior spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began, and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profit.
Third quarter available seat miles and nonfuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance.
We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had 4 points of notable cost pressure in the third quarter, and these 4 points were primarily due to premium pay as well as other ramp-up cost. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight schedules to provide more staffing cushion. The reduction in premium pay provides a roughly 2-point unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter.
Our 2 largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary wages and benefits and airport costs. These 2 categories alone are driving 3 to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-2-year basis. First, on salary wages and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is a tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year-end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation.
Second on airport costs. By year-end, we will have 18 new airports in our network. So our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. 
Our fourth quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years.  
Also in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program and lower productivity than historical norms. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near term and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network.
Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth quarter bottom line outlook is trending better than third quarter except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly $120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter. And underlying revenue trends have picked up, which is encouraging, even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment.
Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise.
Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at Investor Day. And I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Andrew."

I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To sum up our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery trend we experienced from March through July. The impact of the Delta variant began impacting revenues around the beginning of August. And we saw slowing and inconsistent pass-through traffic and bookings, along with an increase in trip cancellations through about mid-September.
In terms of overall revenue loss, September bore the brunt of the impact, and we saw that across all geographies and for both leisure and business travel. As with prior waves, when we have a step down in demand, especially with the slide we saw in business demand in September, yields are tough to manage. However, we had better success in terms of maintaining load factors in the low 80% range for the third quarter.
And the silver lining is that the overall impact from the Delta variant, estimated to be $300 million in Q3 and another $100 million in Q4, was less severe than what we experienced from prior COVID waves. As you may recall, operating revenues stalled down in the negative 60% range from September through February. So travel demand is much more resilient today than this time last year.
While there's a lingering impact to fourth quarter operating revenues from the Delta variant, revenue trends have improved substantially since mid-September. Trip cancellations have decreased and stabilized, and we've seen an increase in bookings across all geographies for both leisure and business. Operating revenues are currently expected to improve sequentially throughout the fourth quarter.  
The booking curve has normalized and bookings thus far for the holidays in November, December are healthy and supported by improving leisure demand. In fact, our overall booking curve is currently trending in line with 2019 levels for the holidays, which is encouraging. In terms of business travel trends, our managed business revenues were down in the lower 60% range in both July and August year-over-2-year, but took a step back in September to down 73%.
However, this trend has reversed as we are experiencing steady improvements in business bookings thus far in October. Based on current trends, we expect managed business revenues to continue improving modestly in November and December and end at down roughly 60% by year-end. This estimate is less optimistic than what we previously shared prior to the impact from the Delta variant as many corporations pushed back their campus openings until after the new year. But we remain cautiously optimistic about overall business travel improvement throughout year-end, and we believe there is some pent-up business demand and there's a chance that we see a pick-up at a faster clip as we get into early 2022. 
We are now live on all 3 of our planned GDS platforms: Amadeus, Travelport and Sabre. We have now removed the friction from businesses working with Southwest, and we have a full array of distribution channels that they can choose from. Early indications from our GDS launch as we are gaining incremental volume through the GDS channel and seen a great response for Southwest fares through the GDS. As expected, we are also seeing some channel shift from our Direct Connect channel to GDS, which is perfectly okay and sets us up for broader appeal to corporations through the channel of their choice.  
Turning to our new markets. They continue to develop well and overall performed in line with expectations in the third quarter. Hawaii markets were impacted more severely as travel warnings were issued against travel to the islands. However, all of these growth markets have shown improvement recently in line with the broad-based improvement we are seeing across the rest of the network.  
And lastly, our Rapid Rewards program continued to show progress in the third quarter with other revenues up 10% on a year-over-2-year basis. We remain convinced about the growth opportunities of Rapid Rewards and our co-brand portfolio which we recently expanded in terms of our credit card offerings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
31726,694554660,2409412,"Southwest Airlines Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Southwest Airlines Co.","Executives","Well, thanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone, on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally. It's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services",947,"Well, thanks, Andrew, and hello, everyone, on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally. It's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services like wheelchairs and concessions, match requirements for customers and our people and still have a very challenging supply chain and hiring environment. And all of those things are impacting travel experience for our customers and for our employees.
Our third quarter operational results reflect that environment. And we have a number of employees making significant sacrifices to help us navigate through it, and I am extremely grateful to them for their support to engage in a very difficult arena. And they're just special warriors.
We finished the quarter with a 71.7% on-time performance. And while that was fixed in the industry, those delays were generally less than 45 minutes, and our on-time performance at 60 minutes was 90.4%, which was fourth in the industry. We did have our best third quarter bag handling performance in our history with, of course, the exception of last year when our bag volumes were slightly less than half of this year. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. So while I am not satisfied with our overall results and we can and we will do better, our people worked very, very hard to take care of our customers.  
As we move forward, we are focused on a couple of targeted actions. First, we know that our on-time performance has been impacted all summer by a combination of high load factors and especially going into and out of our largest cities and the reduction in frequencies from our typical network. In fact, our largest cities experienced full airplanes coming in and out nearly every day, and they had much more extensive connecting activities, including bag volumes than what we had seen pre COVID.  
And those activities took more time to complete than we had scheduled for our turns. And given the heavy load factors, we tended to hold the flight for connections, given the reduction in frequencies and our inability to reaccommodate the customers. And that, of course, put pressure on our on-time performance, and that averaged roughly 66% from July through mid-August. So as the customer volumes declined mid-August through September and those activities lessened, our on-time performance improved to 80%. And that was a welcome improvement, but again, it was below our historical performance in that period.
So in the near term, we have focused hiring efforts to increase staffing at the airports to give us more resources to handle those activities when our load factors increase over the holiday periods. And we're also better using our staffing tools to more accurately match our scheduled shift with those activities. So I expect both those additional resources and more focused staffing execution will boost our on-time performance going forward. And then for future schedules, we are looking at scheduling opportunities to move ground times around to places where it's most needed to keep our flat lines on time as long as this connection activity is expected.
And a second -- in a separate but still related issue from on-time performance is balancing our schedule with our crew resources. All of our employees should expect to be able to bid their shift, they show up to work and it'd be the same as what they bid and then they get to go home as planned. And I've mentioned before that those staffing plans were based on various models that have assumptions in them for things like vacation and sick leave, open time or shift pickup rate and the time it takes to fill open positions.
And while we had adjusted those assumptions going into the summer to provide more staffing cushion, they just weren't enough to match the reality of the environment that we were operating through. And that was particularly impactful to our flight crews. Our sick trends were much higher than expected and our open time pickup rates were also impacted. And those were more pronounced on weekends, and we were routinely exhausting our reserves to cover those impacted flights. And that's what causes the crew reroutes and the unplanned overtime and the unscheduled overnights and all of that impacts our people. So it's a spiral that we just have to break.  
And to do that, we've adjusted our fourth quarter flight schedules downward as previously announced. And we have new-hire flight attendants along with pilots returning from extended leaves that are coming back online in the fourth quarter. And those actions will boost our crew reserves to 20% for our pilots and around 26% for our flight attendants. We'll also expect our sick trends, which include COVID impacts, to begin to decline as this Delta variant begins to wane.  
So in summary, we continue to add staffing, and we've made schedule adjustments to both improve our on-time performance and add more staffing cushion to navigate through our current environment. And as our environment and our staffing and scheduling balance begin to stabilize, we'll be in a good position to begin restoring our network frequencies during 2022.  
So in closing, we've had our share of operational headwinds this year. I know the environment is full of stressors and distractions. And I just want to express my continued thanks to all those employees that have made significant sacrifices to take care of our customers and to support their co-Hearts. I know they have tremendous pride in our company, and the company is tremendously proud of them. 
And with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back to you."

I think everybody in this room is very hopeful that, that's what we've got in front of us. I think we're -- I pushed a little too hard there in the third quarter with capacity, but the encouraging thing is demand is there. We've got a line of sight to airplanes. I think what I mentioned in the second quarter, we've got airport capacity. And right now, our constraint is just making sure that we have the people resources to balance all that.
So that's going to be a priority, repairing the balance sheet, at least to a degree. Tammy's nodding her head here, is certainly an objective for us. And you got 2 levers, one is paying down debt, the other one is generating earnings. So both of those work in tandem. But it will -- I think our long history of returning or having returns to shareholders, it has not changed. It will just have to, obviously, feather in with this very different environment that we're finding ourselves in and an interesting growth opportunity over the next 5 years. 
So Bob, I don't know -- or Tammy, if there's anything you'd like to add."

Now I mean, obviously, aircraft size is an issue, demographics have changed. I'm guessing people check more bags. I don't know if there's anything in the labor contract that prohibits flight attendant contribution, that sort of thing, longer stage means more fuel to pump.  
I'm just wondering what else has happened that prevents you from having a 10-minute turn? And obviously, I'm not suggesting you ever get back there, but I've got to imagine you can do better than what you currently are. So what are some of the other constraints that I haven't thought through?"

But Mike, his team and technology just rolled out some technology this week, in fact, that will help address what you're describing. But the 10-minute turn, Jamie, my first flight on Southwest was in 1972, and there were 2 other passengers on the flight. It does not take long to turn an airplane in 10 minutes when there's 3 customers.  
I asked Lamar Muse when I first became CEO about who was the genius that designed the open seating concept. And he very colorfully told me that, ""You don't need to assign seats when the airplanes are empty."" So the passengers are the gating factor with the turn. It's rarely the bags. With the more connecting bags you have, obviously, that calculus can change.
But I'll tell you one other funny old story and these all predate me, although I was a customer in the 1970s and experienced this. We actually would push the airplane before everybody was in their seat, much less buckled in with a seatbelt. So all kind of quaint stories now. But I think you're probably more interested in what we can do realistically. So Mike, do you want to talk about those targets you have?"

But I think we do focus on the turn and we break it down into different components. And you start just with the different components, the offload and then the clean and then the loading backup. And there are several things that make the turn longer today than they were back in the days when you remember the 10-minute turn.
And so one of the big items right now is the ADA and wheelchairs and making sure that we have wheelchair accommodations for people. That probably adds 3 or 4 or 5 minutes just trying to get people loaded on the airplane. And a lot of times, they are magically healed getting on -- from the slide, we don't need them getting off. But when they do need them getting off, it actually adds several minutes again. So I think just the wheelchair process is probably adding 5 to 10 minutes of that in a turn.
The second thing that you have is just more people are bringing bags on the airplane. And we've got the sky -- the new overhead bins on the new airplanes, trying to get all those things stored. That takes a little bit longer than normal. And those are really the 2 primary things. The third thing is back when I first started at Southwest Airlines, we -- our ops agents were at the door of the airplane, and so any coordination they had to do with the cockpit was right there at the door of the airplane.
Today, depending on you probably walk down some of the jet bridges, they are long walks and our ops agents sometimes have to make that trip 2 or 3 times. And that's one of the things what Gary was talking about, we just rolled out some technology that will allow us to have a mobile platform and get our ops agents back closer to the door of the airplane. So that will help also."

So yes, just to give you an idea of at least the -- how we've deployed our aircraft here currently, as we've talked about, we have the 18 new cities and, of course, we've added Hawaii. So when you look at all of those together, we have about 92 airplanes deployed in either new cities or in Hawaii service. So -- which means that's 92 aircraft left that we have in our network kind of pre-pandemic, if you will.
So we need to go back and backfill that number of aircraft to at least get us back to kind of where we were pre-pandemic. And then as we look ahead to 2022, we're making some adjustments to our capacity here in the near term as we've taken you through. So we'll want to add that capacity as quickly as we can. But obviously, demand is going to be a pacing factor and, of course, our staffing levels as we covered with you.

And we talk about restoration overall like that, but that's a subset of that, a very large subset, which is the depth we talk about. 
And so the depth markets are primarily business-oriented markets. So we expect to, with the pace of business travel return, bring in those depth markets over our next year. Those same depth markets are the ones that also facilitate recovery, the day-to-day recovery that Mike was talking about. And our March through summer schedules, as we anticipate seeing a step change in that level of density and depth in our network. We won't be fully restored again for over a year, but the part which really appeals to business travelers and helps micro recovery, we expect to see substantial progress from March through the end of summer."

However, to give you a little bit of context, some of our largest corporations actually use all 3, so they're using Southwest SWABIZ, they're using our Direct Connect and now they're using GDS. And they use them for different populations and travel purposes. So the amount that's going through each of those 3 channels really depends on the population of who's traveling at that company right now. So it's hard to make definitive statements about what the overall shift will be when we're kind of done and dusted here as business travel finishes out its ramp-up. But right now, we see it's clearly incremental and we're certainly planning our business case for a substantial amount of shift."

I can start, Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have.

I can start, Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have. But yes, just kind of picking up from where we are here in the third quarter, our CASM-Ex was up about 3.5% and that was on a year-over-year 2 basis. And so clearly, we've got some ramp-up cost pressures here currently. And as I said earlier, that was about 4 points and that related to premium pay and ramp-up costs.  
So if you adjust for that impact, our third quarter CASM-Ex would have been slightly below third quarter 2019 on capacity that's down about 2%. So we've taken some cost-cutting measures here that we've implemented during the pandemic, and that's namely the voluntary retirement program and our extended leave program. And while those had substantial savings this year, the benefit is certainly temporary as all those employees were -- will be back here by year-end.
And of course, as you know, we've shared that we're hiring a substantial number of employees. That we've got a goal to hire 5,000 new employees by year-end to replace many of those who left. So the point being is the cost reductions that we had during the pandemic, those will come back as capacity comes back. So that puts us at a much different point in the ramp-up than most of our competitors who still have capacity down much more.  
So we've talked about our 18 new cities and Hawaii investment. So we've allocated capacity here and that has come from pulling down our short- and medium-haul flying. So many of our costs here are back online, and I just want to point out again, we're staffing back up. And our network is very different from what it was pre-pandemic. So that's kind of where we are today.
And then we've also experienced several years of wage rate inflation from where we were in 2019. And as I covered earlier, we've got inflation in airports and pretty much across the board. So when you add to that the lower productivity we're experiencing from some of the behavior changes that we've talked about in this really tough operating environment, point being the environment is just different here.  
So kind of getting to your question, as we move forward, the main thing we want to focus on here is regaining our historical productivity edge. And clearly, the biggest thing is gain operating leverage through restoring the majority of our pre-pandemic network. And so I know that was kind of a long-winded answer there but there are just a lot of moving parts here. 
So we're going to be focused on improving our productivity as we move forward. But I think the biggest question mark I have right now is just what is going to be the extent of the inflationary pressures that we're feeling."

There's just all kinds of fits and starts in the business and different behaviors. And so you've got extra cost and inefficiency that comes through the network moving around. We've had schedules. We cut them back. You've had inefficiencies that have come through just hiring. We're staffing. It takes a while to get people through training. We're still behind. It takes a while for those folks to become productive. So you've got cost inefficiencies there.
We had changes in behavior. I think those are largely COVID-driven. So we have, obviously, direct COVID poles or people. They're literally pulled off -- can't work because of a COVID contact. We have excess sick leave as compared to normal. We have more folks on leaves as compared to normal. That's likely due to -- connected to bringing folks back from those extended leaves earlier than they had planned. So there's all kinds of stuff that is in there, and it's hard to tease apart exactly what the value is of each.  
So I'm with Tammy, job one is to stabilize all of that and then work to get ourselves back to pre-pandemic levels of productivity and efficiency and from then, work on cost past that. But job one is to get back to the -- to wring all this out and get back to the productivity that we had prior to COVID."

As we get the pandemic behind us, I, for one, think that, that will revert back to the mean and will trend and be -- and achieve prior productivity rates. The plus on what you're asking in terms of hiring is we've got 24 airplanes sitting on the ground doing nothing. We've got airplanes that we want to add to the fleet next year.

And we just took more people per trip, and so we immediately lowered trips from October through the end of the year. So just the level of capacity versus staffing was the initial issue.
The second is the day-to-day recovery is more difficult when you have fewer options for reaccommodation, whether that's reaccommodating the customer, the crew or even the airplane to get it where it needs to be that night. And so bringing back that density, we've identified as the #1 thing that will help our day-to-day operations recover more easily when there are things that are exogenous shocks from weather or something else that allows us to recover.
And so getting that back is going to be what we're going to be using our aircraft for over at least the next year and kind of in our network that was preexisting in 2019 will come to look a lot like what we have at the end of next summer, at the end of next year. That core part that operated very well and produced good results will start to look a whole lot similar. It takes a while to get there, but that's what we'll be using the aircraft for versus, say, growth of breadth options, which we used during the pandemic."

But a lot of our traditional business markets are the higher-frequency short haul and we've thinned those out. So I think it's more the -- Andrew, the leisure business that we've adjusted now and we want to go back to restoring, which will be more short-haul, more business-oriented, which beefs up the backbone and helps with recoverability. 
So I don't know if there's a learning that we've had. I think actually, things are playing out the way we thought. But we're all anxious now that demand has recovered.

They understand what we're doing, and then obviously, they understand what we have done to ourselves if we back off frequencies and depth. Obviously, it's going to be tougher to recover our customers and move our crews around. So we knew all that. 
I think the 2 learnings are -- again, we've talked about this a lot. We depended on some hiring to get staffed to support that network and it was just tough to get there. So by the time we were ready to fly, for example, the summer, we just weren't staffed to the point that we thought we would be. And the second learning really was how important the margin is, whether it's crews or ground operations but I think especially crews. 
And as we had lower-margin things like reserves and all that, the operation is just -- it deteriorates faster as you eat up that margin that you've got, especially on the crew side. So to me, really the learning is on just how important it is, Mike's talked about this, to have that margin in the crew network, especially as you operate. And then again, in a thinner network with lower frequencies, as you have to use a part of that margin to move crews around and those kinds of things, it's just not there.

But the people -- if you have enough people, you can have an up-tempo business. And that's what our business -- our whole industry's business wasn't as fast as tempo as everybody had planned it to be. And that's where I think everybody got into issues with their on-time performance and their staffing and their crews. And so everything that everybody else said, I totally agree with. But to me, there's people in the industry that slow the tempo down, we want to be an up-tempo operation. And to get that, we need more people and we need more frequencies."

And maybe just to segue on that last point. On labor availability, your ability to hire ground airport staff or whatever it is you need to support that operation, I assume as you raise rates, that creates demand and more people show up.

I think on the hiring front, just look across the whole United States or the world, hiring is just more difficult because the labor pool is smaller with folks that have not come back into the labor pool. So that's just where we all started. Southwest",388,"Yes. I think on the hiring front, just look across the whole United States or the world, hiring is just more difficult because the labor pool is smaller with folks that have not come back into the labor pool. So that's just where we all started. Southwest is a terrific company, a terrific employer, terrific benefits, and so we do not struggle to get applicants. 
The applicant rates are a little below normal, which is to be expected given the number of open jobs. But no, we've not struggled to get applicants. I think the issues have probably been a couple of things. One, we spent 18 months or a little bit less hiring no one, I mean, basically, no one. In fact, we kind of dismantled the hiring machine and folks that work there and put them into other parts of the business. So once you decide to hire, which for us was probably April, you'd have to -- you have to decide and then you have to rebuild the team that actually works on all that.
So by the time we really got to moving, it's July or August of this year before you could really have new folks back into serving -- to working and serving the airline. You also have to rebuild your training. But I think, overall, again, it's a tough hiring environment but we are not struggling to get people. It is more competitive than ever. And it's especially competitive in our more entry-level jobs, for example, ramp -- on the ramp in airports and it's more competitive in certain parts of the country, like in Denver, for example. 
But no, we're not struggling to find people. We just need -- we need a lot and it's a competitive market, and it takes a while to get them from the hiring -- from the point of hiring to the point of actually being at work. We are using all kinds of new techniques we had not used in the past, instant interviews, instant offers, contingent offers where somebody goes into training ahead of their -- the required things like drug testing and background checking, those kinds of things. So no, I think I'm optimistic we just have a lot to do, trying to hire over 5,000 this fall and 8,000 next year."

And if you don't mind, I'm just going to give you 2 minutes on what our objectives are here. Number one, we are -- and this somewhat ties in with Mary's question, we want this pandemic to end, so we certainly want to do everything that we can to encourage people to get vaccinated. I, for one, believe that, that is the path and that's the path that we're promoting. 
We have tried to encourage people to get vaccinated and further with incentives as opposed to using a more punitive approach as an example by charging employees if they're unvaccinated. So we're not doing the latter. We're doing the former, which is to try to encourage. So I think that's important as a background here. 
Second, our objective is to take care of our people in every way that we can in terms of their safety, in terms of their health, in terms of their job security. I think everyone should get vaccinated. However, I respect other views and especially when you consider how much information there is out there and pretty much any view you want to find support for, you can, and that has to obviously be confusing for people. So I don't feel that it's up to me to force people to get vaccinated. 
So I think that's important in answering your question that you know that those are 2 of our objectives. As a practical matter, we've got important trips with -- for our customers coming up in this quarter, in other words, the holidays. The last thing I want is our people distracted with something like this vaccine mandate. The last thing I want is for people to fear that they won't be able to work or have a job. And so we simply put that to rest. And it ties in -- so that objective, I'm sure you would readily recognize. 
But fourthly, which ties into that, we are a government contractor. We have been for decades. It is important to us in a variety of ways. And number one, we serve the military with charters; and number two, we're part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet which, as an example, just helped with Afghan refugees. So those are important to us. In addition to that, they're our largest customer. We carry the mail, we carry a number of government employees as passengers under this contract. 
So we're going to do everything that we can to maintain that contract. And we didn't ask for the mandate but we got it. So -- and the order is from the White House. So all of the agencies that we actually contract with, they're getting direction which is very general from the White House. And as that direction evolves, we evolve with it. And I think what -- again, just to tie in Mary's question, all I was trying to communicate to everyone is that we are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated. What we are trying to do is whatever we need to do to comply with the executive order so we can maintain our government contractor status. 
And if that means that we can do that and not force people off the job in December, that's why we -- this is an evolving process, working with the government in terms of what they expect. And very clearly, we want our employees to know that nobody is going to lose their job on December 9 if we're not perfectly in compliance. So it is a work in progress, and we're going to continue working in good faith to meet the requirements of the executive order. 
But I've already said and I'm sure you've heard that we're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated. How we work through the people that don't get vaccinated or don't seek an accommodation, we're going to have to figure out and we're working with the government on that. 
But we are not going to fire anybody. It makes no sense that we would not respect that and find some way to work with our people on that. And that's what we're determined to do is get the right balance between taking care of our people and maintaining our government contractor status."

I think this is for Gary or Bob. On the vaccine mandate from the consumer perspective, United's CEO made some pretty strong comments yesterday warning about potential holiday travel chaos that other airlines that are still going through this vaccine mandate issue going so far as to say, buyer beware. Could this fall -- any fallout from this trip you up over the holidays? And if not, why not? 
And one of the examples offsite that he gave was say there is a testing regimen put in place. He said that potentially, you guys could have a lot of last-minute -- he didn't say you specifically. Airlines could have a lot of last-minute cancellations as people tested positive and so forth. So I just would like to get your thoughts on that. 
And secondly, I would also like to know who is deciding? Is it Southwest? People who gets these exemptions and how rigorous a process is it? Because it seems like you guys are encouraging people to apply for these."

So they have made that clear. We are very well aligned with the White House direction on all of that. 
So again -- and Dawn, I would just say, my duty is to take care of Southwest Airlines. My duty is to take care of our people and our customers, and we are not going to let this disrupt any of our customers' travel especially during the busy holiday season. With respect to accommodations, this is something that is long-standing within the company. It is a function that we have in Linda's department, and Linda, you're welcome to speak to this. But we have a team of experts who know what the rules are and know how to apply them in terms of medical or religious accommodations. I believe it's Title VII for religious and the ADA for medical. 
So it's not anything new and they're expert at it. What we are trying to do right now is to see what accommodation requests we get so that we can ensure that we're consistent in terms of who we accept and who we deny. Obviously, we're trying to work with our people here and take good care of them.
In terms of encouragement, we are encouraging people to get vaccinated, period. We -- there's nothing new with that. I've been doing that since the vaccine came out, and nothing has changed there. The only thing that's changed is we've got this executive order that mandates the vaccine, and we are working through that in a good faith way and with our best efforts. Linda, anything you want to add?"
