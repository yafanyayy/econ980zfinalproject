Before I turn the call over to Ryan, a few reminders. The results we released this morning reflect 2020 results for ConocoPhillips only. We will not be discussing any Concho specific results today. But beginning in the first quarter of 2021, results will reflect the combined ConocoPhillips-Concho company. 
We will make some forward-looking statements this morning based on current expectations. Actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic SEC filings. We'll also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website. Thanks.

Lately, I've been reflecting on this time a year ago. We had just rolled out a groundbreaking multiyear plan for the company.

We had just rolled out a groundbreaking multiyear plan for the company. The plan was anchored to a comprehensive philosophy and approach we have been espousing since 2016 that was aimed at reversing the failings of the E&P sector to create a sustained value for shareholders through cycles. What was that business model was reinvest about 70% of our cash flows into the lowest cost of supply resource to grow financial returns and free cash flow, return at least 30% of the cash flow to our owners, maintain a very strong balance sheet and lead in ESG stewardship. 
Our multiyear plan gave the market a credible example of how this business model would work. Well almost as soon as the ink had dried on our multiyear plan along came 2020. And for the entire year, nothing went as expected for any of us. But here's the thing, despite the most challenging year in the history of our sector, our business model worked. The value proposition prevailed. We exercised available flexibility without forfeiting productive capacity. We high-graded our portfolio. We executed our programs and returned over 50% of our cash to our owners. Our balance sheet stayed strong and we continued to up our game on ESG. In other words, our value proposition passed the test of 2020. 
And this strengthened our conviction that we have the right model for this volatile sector. This conviction is what led us to acquire Concho in a transaction that will enhance our ability to deliver our proven value proposition. So we've turned the difficult experience of 2020 into an opportunity to emerge as an even stronger, more investable company for our sector. 
Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2020 results for ConocoPhillips. Because the Concho transaction closed after year-end, the results we reported today represent stand-alone ConocoPhillips performance for 2020. However, beginning January 1, our 2021 results will reflect the combined company performance. 
Now I don't plan to review the results we announced this morning. I just described some of the important highlights from last year. But this morning's results should give you all confidence that the underlying stand-alone ConocoPhillips business is running very well, thanks to the many efforts of our workforce. And I can assure you the Concho Permian business is running well too. And again, thanks to our workforce in Midland. 
Our mindset as we start 2021 is all about doing the work and delivering the results that make us the best E&P company in the business. And to align all of us here are our key focus areas for '21: our top priority is to create the strongest competitor in the business from the combination of ConocoPhillips and Concho. The closing of the Concho transaction cleared the way for us to begin comprehensive integration and optimization efforts across every part of our business. We're just getting started post closing, but we're already taking actions that will drive greater efficiency and capture best practices to ensure we perform at the highest level organizationally, technically, operationally, financially and culturally. 
We have already identified the sources of capital and cost reductions to meet the $500 million target we set when the deal was announced. And I can report that we will significantly outperform those initial expectations as we review our processes, share best practices and organize for the new realities of the business. 
But let me put our revised saving expectations into perspective for you. Compared to pro forma 2019 adjusted operating cost of approximately $7 billion, we anticipate being at an annual run rate of approximately $6 billion in 2022, assuming a similar production level of roughly 1.5 billion -- million barrels a day equivalent. Now this $1 billion reduction, about $400 million of that was driven by actions taken by both companies prior to the deal announcement, with the remaining savings to be realized through cost reductions implemented in conjunction with the transaction. It represents a major value upgrade for the company because it greatly enhances the competitiveness of our free cash flow-generating capability which is how we'll win. We'll be implementing our cost reduction actions throughout 2021, and we'll provide updates on our progress along the way. 
The next priority is to execute the announced operating capital plan of $5.5 billion. This budget is comprised of sustaining capital of about $5.1 billion and about $400 million that would be directed toward major capital projects, primarily in Alaska and ongoing appraisal activity. 
Now for this level of capital, we expect to produce about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day equivalent, which is roughly flat to 2020 pro forma production adjusted for curtailments and asset sale. 
In this morning's supplemental material, we provided operating capital plan by segment. We expect to spend about 55% of our capital in the Lower 48, with the remainder allocated across our diverse global programs. 
We set the capital budget at about $5.5 billion for 2 principal reasons: first, while the macro environment has firmed up recently, we are cautious about the trajectory and the timing of a recovery. Demand recovery is taking longer, spare supply remains and inventories remain elevated. It makes no sense to grow into this market environment, so we're choosing to stay at a sustaining level for the year. 
Second, we're committed to growing free cash flow, and we are setting up the company to be a significant free cash flow generator. That means maintaining capital discipline, but also driving program improvements that enhance uplift efficiency. In other words, we're driving for free cash flow growth, not production growth. 
At $5.5 billion of capital in 2021, and if current prices hold, we expect to generate significant additional free cash flow. In that situation, our dividend alone will not be sufficient to meet our target of returning greater than 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. You should not be surprised to see us reactivate buybacks as a channel, and we always like the idea of improving net debt. 
A third key 2021 priority is engagement with our various stakeholders. This includes investors, regulators, government officials, partners, communities and our workforce. We're undergoing a significant level of change, both on the inside as we integrate our companies, but also in the external environment. While we consider engagement part of ordinary business, there's no question this priority has taken on a new level of importance in today's environment, especially given the recent industry-related announcements coming from the new Biden administration. 
Now let me take a moment to address our thoughts about the administration's recent pronouncements of a temporary moratorium on leasing and permitting on federal lands. I have to say we were not entirely surprised by the announcement. In fact, President Biden said during the campaign that he would issue a temporary moratorium on new leasing. As for the permitting moratorium, the administration has publicly indicated this as a temporary pause and that they will continue to issue permits. Obviously, we hope these temporary actions are resolved in a timely fashion, and we are certainly watching the situation closely. 
Now from our perspective, some of the recent executive actions targeting U.S. oil and gas production will have a negative economic and environmental consequences to the American people. If the moratoriums become permanent, they will eliminate well paying jobs, mainly in rural America, slower economic recovery, negatively impact energy and national security and increase our reliance on higher GHG foreign barrels. We certainly want to avoid these outcomes. So we stand ready to work with the Biden team as we did successfully with the Obama-Biden administration to find balanced solutions to address the issues. 
As for the questions of what a permitting moratorium could mean for ConocoPhillips specifically, let me take that head on. While we certainly are going to engage to protect our interest, ConocoPhillips has the flexibility, the diversity and the depth of low cost of supply and low GHG resource to manage through this issue without materially impacting our plans. 
And a final 2021 priority will be continuing to top our game on another issue that is very important to our stakeholders, namely ESG. This is an area where we have a long-term demonstrated track record of commitment and performance. But clearly, there is heightened interest across all of the industry on this topic. We continue to accept our responsibility for continuing ESG improvement. And, in fact, embrace the opportunity to be an industry leader. 
Last year, we became the first U.S.-based upstream company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy. We set internal emission reduction targets that are consistent with the goals of that agreement, and are taking significant measures to monitor and reduce methane emissions across our operations. In addition, we're actively advocating for a well-designed price on carbon in the U.S. because we believe that's the most economically efficient and effective step that can be taken by the U.S. to set the world on a sustainable path to long-term GHG emission reductions. While we work diligently to reduce emissions on a parallel path, we have established a low-carbon team within the company. That team is conducting in-depth studies of energy transition alternatives, monitoring trends and evaluating the economics and the viability of these alternatives for ConocoPhillips over time. 
Our Board is engaged with the team and its work, and we're committed to continuing our analysis on this important topic. But at least for now, we believe the highest value we can create for all our stakeholders is by buying the best E&P company in the business. The world needs clean, low-cost barrels that are safely delivered by disciplined, free cash flow- and returns-focused companies like ConocoPhillips. 
2020 was indeed a challenging year, but the lessons and accomplishments we took from it put us in great stead not only for 2021, but as a $75 billion enterprise value industry leader. We're in a unique position to help transform the perception and the performance of our sector with a clear vision of what we need to do, deliver value from the Concho transaction, execute our 2021 operating plan, engage with our stakeholders and keep pressing on ESG leadership. We look forward to keeping you informed and -- of that progress as we go throughout the year. 
Now let me turn that back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

And one that most of your peers have ended up emulating over the past couple of years. And while having a good -- a head start is usually a good thing, a paradigm shift seems to be underway in energy with investor expectations for management teams changing too. So my question is, what are some of the things that the management team is going to need to do to sustain its leadership position in this new environment to continue to be the best E&P company? With these new realities, I think, is the way you phrased it a few minutes ago. So that's my question."

You've been an incredible partner and thought leader in the industry and have gotten it right more times than you've gotten it wrong, so kudos to you as well. So thank you. 
Yes. Doug, it's really good. A lot of external pressures right now, certainly on the industry and on what's happening with the new administration. I guess I go back to kind of our 3 areas that we think are really critical for success of an E&P company. And I think it starts with returns on and returns of capital. You've got to generate a competitive return for our shareholders in this business. You got to do that sustainably and through the cycles. And we think that's critically important, and we're well bought into that, as you know, for a number of years. And to do that, we've got to also deliver this low greenhouse gas affordable energy all around the world, and that's going to be a part as we go through this transition that's really important. And I think it's maybe lost in some of the rhetoric today, just how important oil and gas is to this transition that we're going to be going through over the next number of years and decades. 
And then finally, you have to do that sustainably. We have to do that with the environment in mind. We can't put the planet through a great experiment. We've been an advocate of this and been a supporter for a long period of time. And as I described in my opening remarks, it's about taking care of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and we're on a pathway to reduce that intensity by 2030 that puts us on a pathway to 2050 and the goal that's consistent with the Paris agreement. So we think everybody needs to be focused on your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
And then for Scope 3, we advocate for a price on carbon. We think that's the best way, that's the most economical way. It's the most -- the best way that the market can deal with this issue and drive consumer behavior that takes -- that puts us on the pathway that's consistent with the Paris agreement as well. So that's how we've come up with our climate strategy, and that's how we're dealing with this kind of contra around how do you get energy and make it affordable? How do you make it sustainable? And how do you make it resilient and something that shareholders can invest in?"

We recognize that the ordinary dividend today and the kind of market we're experiencing today, and if you look at the forward curves, that would be insufficient, so we recognize we'd have to take some of that free cash flow and return that to the shareholder. And that's certainly our commitment. And as I said in my opening remarks, always -- with what we experienced in 2020, having a really, really strong balance sheet is really important.

But our view is that in the medium term, it's quite possible that we'll spend some time above mid-cycle prices. And because a little bit of some demand reduction. We know there's been significant supply reduction, particularly in the U.S. 
If you think if we give some numbers to that, I mean, U.S. tight oil production was 8.2 million barrels a day in December of 2019. And last year, it was 7 million barrels a day. So that's a significant drop. And our view is that at $50 a barrel or thereabouts, the current strip price below 50s, so assuming that the 6 day moratorium on permit hasn't extended for a long period. When U.S. tight oil will probably average around 7 million barrels a day for 2021, at least that's our sense of it. 
And if you take that and look at 2022, that's at least 2 million or 3 million barrels a day                 pre-COVID trend. So assuming demand comes back in 2022 and assuming U.S. produce discipline box, I think it's reasonable to expect a few years above mid-cycle.

But when you mentioned in terms of potential expectations for the buyback to resume, you said it could be maybe around the level at pre-transaction pre-COVID transaction level. So I know that you had announced like a $1 billion buyback in 4Q '20 alone, which got canceled. So are we supposed to be anchoring around that? Or is it more kind of the 2019 expectations?"

But we'll give that update to you, Phil, longer term, but expect that there will be some ramp-up to an optimized kind of levels, both at the company level and the asset level.

The -- obviously, there's obviously severance costs here in terms of where we have duplicate labor and other savings. There is obviously fees and associated with that. But once we get through this year and get through those costs, I think we're focused really on what our cost structure will look like. So maybe just to give a bit of an update on that. I want to be clear about that. The integration is going well. That's on the system side, the organization side. And we are -- we do have line of sight to exceed our targeted $500 million cost and capital savings we announced at the time of the transaction. 
So if you remember, that $500 million was made up of $350 million of operating cost savings and $150 million of capital reductions. And those really came across 3 areas: the direct savings from the transaction, restructuring our corporate staff groups to better align with our new portfolio on the ConocoPhillips side, and then stopping our new ventures exploration program. That reduced our targeted exploration spend from $300 million to $150 million a year. And in fact, our 2021 capital program of $5.5 billion reflects a reduced exploration capital spend along those lines. 
Now our expected operating cost savings have now increased from $350 million to $600 million. So our teams have really done an excellent job turning over every stone, both in relation to the transaction. And restructuring our center. So in total, the operating cost and capital reductions will now amount to $750 million. So we're up from $500 million to $750 million, and we're still counting. 
I think, as Matt mentioned, we still have the opportunity for cost and capital efficiencies across our D&C spend. Supply chain economies of scale and also improved price realizations on the commercial and marketing side. So we do expect that 70 -- $750 million to increase through the year. And we'll be providing another update on that in March. 
Now finally, just to tie back to Ryan's prepared remarks, with the operating cost savings having increased to $600 million, together with the $400 million of sustainable cost reductions, each company made -- both companies made together, in 2020, we anticipate our 2022 operating costs to be around $6 billion, and that's $1 billion less than our pro forma costs in 2019, and that was really the last normal year pre-pandemic. So it represents the best baseline. And that's all assuming production flat at about 1.5 million barrels a day. So at the end of the day, as we think about, we get through these transition costs this year. We then get into our run rate of about $6 billion. 
It's those bottom line costs that matter at the end of the day, and that's what we're very focused on: to make really the company the strongest competitor in the business from 2 already very strong companies."

With that said, when -- if they don't compete for capital, we've demonstrated our ability to move them out of the portfolio, and we'll do that if their cost supply gets higher, and they don't compete for capital, but that's how we're really focused and feel like the portfolio today is in a really good shape. 
What we're investing in is a less than $40 cost of supply and it averages below $30, so we feel very comfortable we can deliver the returns of capital, returns on capital, even through the cycles in this business with the portfolio that we have. And part of that includes those LNG projects that you described. Now we did divest at one at the end of last year in Australia, and we did that because we were concerned about the cost of supply and the GHG footprint amongst a few other things. But we are -- we do like the LNG projects. We think we're -- we like the market in Asia. We like the growing need for gas around the whole world. We are interested in competing in Qatar for another train. We think it's -- that should be coming soon. It's been certainly delayed with COVID like everything else. But if it fits our investment profiles and our investment thoughts around cost of supply, we'd like to participate in that because it ultimately lowers capital intensity and really helps, we think, the overall portfolio.

And so their primary focus, that low carbon team we have now is focusing on those opportunities most relevant to our core business and to our core competencies. So those are things like carbon capture, use and storage, carbon offsets, alternative power sources to further reduce the emissions intensity of our operations. And so -- and now they're also working with the BUs, our business units very closely to implement the lowest cost opportunities we have to reduce operational emissions more broadly. So that is where our primary focus is. We are looking more broadly as well in monitoring. But as you say, at the end of the day, we've got to achieve the 3 things that Ryan laid out.

I think our focus is just integrating these 2 great companies, and that's really the whole focus of the company right now. So I'd say we're not trying to be distracted on anything else other than driving the efficiencies, the cost reductions, the free cash flow growth and then applying all these best practice and learnings that we have across 2 great companies to the current company that we have. 
With that said, no, I don't think M&A is done in this business. I think if -- you got to continue to drive down cost of supply, you want the best resource in the business, and you got to be the most sustainable company from an ESG perspective. And I think continuing to drive out costs in the business is going to be a good thing. So no, I don't think M&A is over. And I think we've laid out our framework for how we think about that, but that's not on the radar screen right now relative to our company, we're focused on just driving the best results we can out of the transaction that we did with Concho."

We know there's a ramp-up to an optimized plateau for the whole company and for each one of the individual assets, and that's informed by the market environment that we find ourselves in, the long-term mid-cycle price. And in what but production comes out of that an output. We're not trying to drive a certain amount of growth, I think, to an earlier question that we had. We're trying to grow free cash flow. We're trying to make sure that we get as efficient as we can to drive as much free cash flow growth as we can. And we'll take what the macro gives us and that will set a capital allocation, and then we'll make sure that we're developing the lowest cost of supply resources for that capital. And doing that across our global portfolio. I think we've demonstrated that capability and have been really committed to it since we started down the journey as a big E&P company. 
So maybe let me have Tim talk a little bit about your first part, Doug, on the federal land exposure."

And that's really what we're working on now on the -- just as a reminder, to something you already know on the Federal lease side. We said, short term, that the -- what's going on with the federal leases really doesn't affect greatly any of our plans in the short term, we can still deliver on everything that we said we're going to do.

But uncertainty around administrations in fiscal terms and permitting and all that, that really exists all around the whole world. We're kind of going through a little bit of that during the recency of this new administration. So I wouldn't get hung up. And it really -- we take it into consideration, but we're focused on just making sure we got the lowest supply resources we're developing those. We do value diversification, as you've described, but we want to make sure it's diverse across our cost of supply mantra. So we're all about diversification, but it's got to be low cost supply. So we think about that globally. We think about it when it comes time to allocate capital. And certainly, the company does have a large North American footprint, but we like it, and we've worked with prior administrations to get all our work done, and we've permitted the activity and we do it responsibly and sustainably. So we think we've got a good track record as a company. So I think that's where our focus and attention is at. 
Now on some of the exploration stuff, as Dominic said, we've reduced our allocation to kind of those new venture exploration opportunities from $300 million to $150 million. And that's where places that South America and other places around the world may not compete in the portfolio. So we'll be looking at trying to monetize those and potentially get out of them."

We're the operator there and then the Slugugle discovery is even nearer Hedron. It's oil, and it's between 75 million and 200 million barrels-or so, we're really excited about that as well, and where they operated there. So we would expect those being in the vicinity of existing infrastructure we would expect those to be very low cost supply, subsea tiebacks is probably what we have in mind. But we have more appraisal work to do. This is a study here. Now I might add as well, we have just picked up a couple of new prospects just near vaca and seggle in that area.

Lately, I've been reflecting on this time a year ago. We had just rolled out a groundbreaking multiyear plan for the company.

We had just rolled out a groundbreaking multiyear plan for the company. The plan was anchored to a comprehensive philosophy and approach we had been espousing since 2016 that was aimed at reversing the failings of the E&P sector to create a sustained value for shareholders through cycles. What was that business model? Was reinvest about 70% of our cash flows into the lowest cost of supply resource to grow financial returns and free cash flow, return at least 30% of the cash flow to our owners, maintain a very strong balance sheet and lead in ESG stewardship.  
Our multiyear plan gave the market a credible example of how this business model would work. Well almost as soon as the ink had dried on our multiyear plan along came 2020. And for the entire year, nothing went as expected for any of us. But here's the thing, despite the most challenging year in the history of our sector, our business model worked. The value proposition prevailed. We exercised available flexibility without forfeiting productive capacity. We high-graded our portfolio. We executed our programs and returned over 50% of our cash to our owners. Our balance sheet stayed strong and we continued to up our game on ESG. In other words, our value proposition passed the test of 2020.
And this strengthened our conviction that we have the right model for this volatile sector. This conviction is what led us to acquire Concho in a transaction that will enhance our ability to deliver our proven value proposition. So we've turned the difficult experience of 2020 into an opportunity to emerge as an even stronger, more investable company for our sector.
Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2020 results for ConocoPhillips. Because the Concho transaction closed after year-end, the results we reported today represent stand-alone ConocoPhillips performance for 2020. However, beginning January 1, our 2021 results will reflect the combined company performance.  
Now I don't plan to review the results we announced this morning. I just described some of the important highlights from last year. But this morning's results should give you all confidence that the underlying stand-alone ConocoPhillips business is running very well, thanks to the many efforts of our workforce. And I can assure you the Concho Permian business is running well too. And again, thanks to our workforce in Midland.  
Our mindset as we start 2021 is all about doing the work and delivering the results that make us the best E&P company in the business. And to align all of us here are our key focus areas for '21. Our top priority is to create the strongest competitor in the business from the combination of ConocoPhillips and Concho. The closing of the Concho transaction cleared the way for us to begin comprehensive integration and optimization efforts across every part of our business. We're just getting started post-closing, but we're already taking actions that will drive greater efficiency and capture best practices to ensure we perform at the highest level organizationally, technically, operationally, financially and culturally.
We have already identified the sources of capital and cost reductions to meet the $500 million target we set when the deal was announced. And I can report that we will significantly outperform those initial expectations as we review our processes, share best practices and organize for the new realities of the business.  
But let me put our revised saving expectations into perspective for you. Compared to pro forma 2019 adjusted operating cost of approximately $7 billion, we anticipate being at an annual run rate of approximately $6 billion in 2022, assuming a similar production level of roughly 1.5 billion -- million barrels a day equivalent. Now this $1 billion reduction, about $400 million of that was driven by actions taken by both companies prior to the deal announcement, with the remaining savings to be realized through cost reductions implemented in conjunction with the transaction. It represents a major value upgrade for the company because it greatly enhances the competitiveness of our free cash flow-generating capability which is how we'll win. We'll be implementing our cost reduction actions throughout 2021, and we'll provide updates on our progress along the way.  
The next priority is to execute the announced operating capital plan of $5.5 billion. This budget is comprised of sustaining capital of about $5.1 billion and about $400 million that would be directed toward major capital projects, primarily in Alaska and ongoing appraisal activity. Now for this level of capital, we expect to produce about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day equivalent, which is roughly flat to 2020 pro forma production adjusted for curtailments and asset sale.  
In this morning's supplemental material, we provided operating capital plan by segment. We expect to spend about 55% of our capital in the Lower 48, with the remainder allocated across our diverse global programs.
We've set the capital budget at about $5.5 billion for 2 principal reasons: first, while the macro environment has firmed up recently, we are cautious about the trajectory and the timing of a recovery. Demand recovery is taking longer, spare supply remains and inventories remain elevated. It makes no sense to grow into this market environment, so we're choosing to stay at a sustaining level for the year.  
Second, we're committed to growing free cash flow, and we are setting up the company to be a significant free cash flow generator. That means maintaining capital discipline, but also driving program improvements that enhance uplift efficiency. In other words, we're driving for free cash flow growth, not production growth.  
At $5.5 billion of capital in 2021, and if current prices hold, we expect to generate significant additional free cash flow. In that situation, our dividend alone will not be sufficient to meet our target of returning greater than 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. You should not be surprised to see us reactivate buybacks as a channel, and we always like the idea of improving net debt.  
A third key 2021 priority is engagement with our various stakeholders. This includes investors, regulators, government officials, partners, communities and our workforce. We're undergoing a significant level of change, both on the inside as we integrate our companies, but also in the external environment. While we consider engagement part of ordinary business, there's no question this priority has taken on a new level of importance in today's environment, especially given the recent industry-related announcements coming from the new Biden administration.  
Now let me take a moment to address our thoughts about the administration's recent pronouncements of a temporary moratorium on leasing and permitting on federal lands. I have to say we were not entirely surprised by the announcement. In fact, President Biden said during the campaign that he would issue a temporary moratorium on new leasing. As for the permitting moratorium, the administration has publicly indicated this as a temporary pause and that they will continue to issue permits. Obviously, we hope these temporary actions are resolved in a timely fashion, and we are certainly watching the situation closely.
Now from our perspective, some of the recent executive actions targeting U.S. oil and gas production will have a negative economic and environmental consequences to the American people. If the moratoriums become permanent, they will eliminate well-paying jobs, mainly in rural America, slower economic recovery, negatively impact energy and national security and increase our reliance on higher GHG foreign barrels. We certainly want to avoid these outcomes. So we stand ready to work with the Biden team as we did successfully with the Obama-Biden administration to find balanced solutions to address the issues.  
As for the questions of what a permitting moratorium could mean for ConocoPhillips specifically, let me take that head on. While we certainly are going to engage to protect our interest, ConocoPhillips has the flexibility, the diversity and the depth of low cost of supply and low GHG resource to manage through this issue without materially impacting our plans.  
And a final 2021 priority will be continuing to up our game on another issue that is very important to our stakeholders, namely ESG. This is an area where we have a long-term demonstrated track record of commitment and performance. But clearly, there is heightened interest across all of the industry on this topic. We continue to accept our responsibility for continuing ESG improvement. And, in fact, embrace the opportunity to be an industry leader.  
Last year, we became the first U.S.-based upstream company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy. We set internal emission reduction targets that are consistent with the goals of that agreement and are taking significant measures to monitor and reduce methane emissions across our operations. In addition, we're actively advocating for a well-designed price on carbon in the U.S. because we believe that's the most economically efficient and effective step that can be taken by the U.S. to set the world on a sustainable path to long-term GHG emission reductions. 
While we work diligently to reduce emissions on a parallel path, we have established a low-carbon team within the company. That team is conducting in-depth studies of energy transition alternatives, monitoring trends and evaluating the economics and the viability of these alternatives for ConocoPhillips over time.  
Our Board is engaged with the team and its work, and we're committed to continuing our analysis on this important topic. But at least for now, we believe the highest value we can create for all our stakeholders is by being the best E&P company in the business. The world needs clean, low-cost barrels that are safely delivered by disciplined, free cash flow and returns-focused companies like ConocoPhillips.  
2020 was indeed a challenging year, but the lessons and accomplishments we took from it put us in great stead not only for 2021, but as a $75 billion enterprise value industry leader. We're in a unique position to help transform the perception and the performance of our sector with a clear vision of what we need to do, deliver value from the Concho transaction, execute our 2021 operating plan, engage with our stakeholders and keep pressing on ESG leadership. We look forward to keeping you informed and -- of that progress as we go throughout the year.  
Now let me turn that back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions."

And while having a good -- a head start is usually a good thing, a paradigm shift seems to be underway in energy with investor expectations for management teams changing too. 
So my question is, what are some of the things that the management team is going to need to do to sustain its leadership position in this new environment to continue to be the best E&P company with these new realities, I think, is the way you phrased it a few minutes ago? So that's my question."

And first, a big call out and a congratulations on your retirement. We know we're going to probably see your name around. You've been an incredible partner and thought leader in the industry and have gotten it right more times than you've gotten it wrong, so kudos to you as well. So thank you. 
Yes. Doug, it's really good. A lot of external pressures right now, certainly on the industry and on what's happening with the new administration. I guess I go back to kind of our 3 areas that we think are really critical for success of an E&P company. And I think it starts with returns on and returns of capital. You've got to generate a competitive return for our shareholders in this business. You got to do that sustainably and through the cycles. And we think that's critically important, and we're well bought into that, as you know, for a number of years. 
And to do that, we've got to also deliver this low greenhouse gas affordable energy all around the world, and that's going to be a part as we go through this transition that's really important. I think it's maybe lost in some of the rhetoric today, just how important oil and gas is to this transition that we're going to be going through over the next number of years and decades.
And then finally, you have to do that sustainably. We have to do that with the environment in mind. We can't put the planet through a great experiment. We've been an advocate of this and been a supporter for a long period of time. And as I described in my opening remarks, it's about taking care of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and we're on a pathway to reduce that intensity by 2030 that puts us on a pathway to 2050 and the goal that's consistent with the Paris agreement. So we think everybody needs to be focused on your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.  
And then for Scope 3, we advocate for a price on carbon. We think that's the best way, that's the most economical way. It's the most -- the best way that the market can deal with this issue and drive consumer behavior that takes -- that puts us on the pathway that's consistent with the Paris agreement as well. 
So that's how we've come up with our climate strategy, and that's how we're dealing with this kind of contra around how do you get energy and make it affordable? How do you make it sustainable? And how do you make it resilient and something that shareholders can invest in?"

So we recognize that our commitment is to deliver 30% back to the shareholder, and we're committed to doing that. We recognize that the ordinary dividend today and the kind of market we're experiencing today, and if you look at the forward curves, that would be insufficient, so we recognize we'd have to take some of that free cash flow and return that to the shareholder.

But our view is that in the medium term, it's quite possible that we'll spend some time above mid-cycle prices. And because a little bit due to some demand reduction. We know there's been significant supply reduction, particularly in the U.S.  
If you think -- if we give some numbers to that, I mean, U.S. tight oil production was 8.2 million barrels a day in December of 2019. And last year, it was 7 million barrels a day. So that's a significant drop. And our view is that at $50 a barrel or thereabouts, the current strip prices below 50s, so assuming there's a 6-day moratorium on permits isn't extended for a long period. When U.S. tight oil will probably average around 7 million barrels a day for 2021, at least that's our sense of it.  
And if you take that and look at 2022, that's at least 2 million or 3 million barrels a day below the pre-COVID trend. So assuming the demand comes back in 2022 and assuming U.S. produces a disciplined bulk, I think it's reasonable to expect a few years above mid-cycle.

The -- obviously, there's obviously severance costs here in terms of where we have duplicate labor and other savings. There are obviously fees associated with that. But once we get through this year and get through those costs, I think we're focused really on what our cost structure will look like. 
So maybe just to give a bit of an update on that. I want to be clear about that. The integration is going well. That's on the system side, the organization side. And we are -- we do have line of sight to exceed our targeted $500 million cost and capital savings we announced at the time of the transaction.
So if you remember, that $500 million was made up of $350 million of operating cost savings and $150 million of capital reductions. And those really came across 3 areas: the direct savings from the transaction, restructuring our corporate staff groups to better align with our new portfolio on the ConocoPhillips side, and then stopping our new ventures exploration program. That reduced our targeted exploration spend from $300 million to $150 million a year. And in fact, our 2021 capital program of $5.5 billion reflects a reduced exploration capital spend along those lines.
Now our expected operating cost savings have now increased from $350 million to $600 million. So our teams have really done an excellent job turning over every stone, both in relation to the transaction and restructuring our center. So in total, the operating cost and capital reductions will now amount to $750 million. So we're up from $500 million to $750 million, and we're still counting. 
I think, as Matt mentioned, we still have the opportunity for cost and capital efficiencies across our D&C spend. Supply chain economies of scale and also improved price realizations on the commercial and marketing side. So we do expect that 70 -- $750 million to increase through the year. And we'll be providing another update on that in March.
Now finally, just to tie back to Ryan's prepared remarks, with the operating cost savings having increased to $600 million, together with the $400 million of sustainable cost reductions, each company made -- both companies made together, in 2020, we anticipate our 2022 operating costs to be around $6 billion, and that's $1 billion less than our pro forma costs in 2019. Now that was really the last normal year pre-pandemic. So it represents the best baseline. And that's all assuming production flat at about 1.5 million barrels a day. So at the end of the day, as we think about, we get through these transition costs this year. We then get into a run rate of about $6 billion. 
It's those bottom line costs that matter at the end of the day, and that's what we're very focused on, to make really the company the strongest competitor in the business from 2 already very strong companies."

With that said, when -- if they don't compete for capital, we've demonstrated our ability to move them out of the portfolio, and we'll do that if their cost of supply gets higher, and they don't compete for capital, but that's how we're really focused and feel like the portfolio today is in a really good shape. 
What we're investing in is a less than $40 cost of supply and it averages below $30, so we feel very comfortable we can deliver the returns of capital, returns on capital, even through the cycles in this business with the portfolio that we have. And part of that includes those LNG projects that you described. 
Now we did divest at one at the end of last year in Australia, and we did that because we were concerned about the cost of supply and the GHG footprint amongst a few other things. But we are -- we do like the LNG projects. We think we're -- we like the market in Asia. We like the growing need for gas around the whole world. We are interested in competing in Qatar for another train. We think it's -- that should be coming soon. It's been certainly delayed with COVID like everything else. 
But if it fits our investment profiles and our investment thoughts around cost of supply, we'd like to participate in that because it ultimately lowers capital intensity and really helps, we think, the overall portfolio. So we're still quite interested in that particular project. And then, obviously, we still have the -- one of the trains in Qatar, we have our APLNG project that's performing very well right now on top of it as well."

And so their primary focus, that low carbon team we have now is focusing on those opportunities most relevant to our core business and to our core competencies. 
So those are things like carbon capture, use and storage, carbon offsets, alternative power sources to further reduce the emissions intensity of our operations. And so -- and now they're also working with the BUs, our business units very closely to implement the lowest cost opportunities we have to reduce operational emissions more broadly. 
So that is where our primary focus is. We are looking more broadly as well in monitoring. But as you say, at the end of the day, we've got to achieve the 3 things that Ryan laid out.

Paul, I'd say there's a bit of recency effect with the Biden administration coming into path and putting all these executive orders. So I would caution everybody not to swing the pendulum too far one side to the other. We know we've got a large position in North America when you consider the Lower 48, Canada and Alaska, we recognize that. But uncertainty around administrations in fiscal terms and permitting and all that, that really exists all around the whole world. We're kind of going through a little bit of that during the recency of this new administration. So I wouldn't get hung up. 
And it really -- we take it into consideration, but we're focused on just making sure we got the lowest supply resources. We're developing those. We do value diversification, as you've described, but we want to make sure it's diverse across our cost of supply mantra. So we're all about diversification, but it's got to be low cost supply. 
So we think about that globally. We think about it when it comes time to allocate capital. And certainly, the company does have a -- we've got a large North American footprint, but we like it, and we've worked with prior administrations to get all our work done, and we've permitted the activity and we do it responsibly and sustainably. So we think we've got a good track record as a company. So I think that's where our focus and attention is at.
Now on some of the exploration stuff, as Dominic said, we've reduced our allocation to kind of those new venture exploration opportunities from $300 million to $150 million. And that's where places that South America and other places around the world may not compete in the portfolio. So we'll be looking at trying to monetize those and potentially get out of them."

But anyway, the Warka discovery, both of these are near Heidrun. And so we would -- we're really pleased and excited about these. I think both of us -- well, the Warka is a gas condensate discovery and Northwest of Heidrun. Our prelim estimates are 50 million to 190 million barrels equivalent. 
We're the operator there and then the Slagugle discovery is even nearer Heidrun. It's oil, and it's between 75 million and 200 million barrels. So we're really excited about that as well, and where they operated there. 
So we would expect those being in the vicinity of existing infrastructure. We would expect those to be very low cost supply, subsea tiebacks is probably what we have in mind. But we have more appraisal work to do. This is a study here. Now I might add as well, we have just picked up a couple of new prospects just near Warka and Slagugle in that area. 
So we're really pleased with our Norwegian exploration team. And -- but at the end of the day, they'll have to compete in our portfolio. And -- but we expect those will be quite competitive."

It's a very busy but exciting time at ConocoPhillips. With the Concho transaction now closed, our entire workforce is on a mission to emerge from last year's extreme sector volatility and the transaction integration activities as the strongest competitor in our business. We're viewing 2021 as a catalyst moment like we did in 2016 to improve every aspect of our business and again, step out from the pack by taking our disciplined, shareholder-friendly value proposition to the next level. We're taking actions across every aspect of the company to improve our underlying drivers, and our first quarter results represent an early indication of our progress. Some of the actions we're taking are transformational such as capturing synergies, others are chipping away at core drivers to improve efficiency and returns, such as the debt reduction plans we announced this morning. 
Here's what everyone in our organization is focused on. First, we believe a safe company is a successful one. With the Concho transaction, we've combined 2 industry-recognized safety leaders, which has aided our overall integration. And again, I want to recognize our workforce for their exceptional handling of the many challenges presented by the Winter Storm Uri last quarter. We're continuously driving to lower the cost of supply of our diverse resource base. We have a deep inventory at the very best rocks, which is a clear source of sustained competitive advantage. And we're always working to further high-grade the portfolio through asset sales. 
But our low-cost inventory loan isn't enough. We're focused on applying our rigorous capital allocation process to optimize investments based on the metrics investors demand, free cash flow and returns. We're driving improvements in free cash flow and returns by driving down our sustaining capital through well cost and supply chain efficiencies as well as margin improvement, driving down our cost structure through synergies and balance sheet improvements, driving down our sustaining price through the combination of lower sustaining capital and lower cost structure. And finally, we don't cap the benefit from higher prices, which means upside in free cash flow above our sustaining price. 
We're only a short time into the Concho integration, but we're already seeing the previously announced synergies materialize, and we expect to yield additional benefits as our integration progresses. We remain committed to returning a significant portion of capital to our shareholders, with a 5-year track record of exceeding our target of greater than 30% of CFO. In fact, our return to shareholders since implementing our returns-focused strategy in 2016 has been 43% of cumulative CFO. So our capital return approach represents a floor on the level of capital returns, not a ceiling. We don't tie our returns to free cash flow like others are doing. So in other words, investors directly benefit from CFO expansion, including from higher prices when they occur. And as you saw in today's release, we're taking actions to further increase our returns of capital in 2021. In addition to our ordinary dividend and our previously announced $1.5 million of buybacks, We intend to begin reducing our Synovis ownership stake, using proceeds to purchase incremental ConocoPhillips stock. 
We're taking action to further strengthen our balance sheet. This morning, we also announced that we're planning to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next 5 years. This will reduce our annual interest expense cost and help lower our sustaining price. And finally, we're focused on leading in ESG, especially in emissions reductions. All of this is underpinned by our talented, motivated workforce. They are the driving force in our progress. You can tell from my comments that we're encouraged by the improvements we're seeing across the company. That's why we announced in today's press release, our intention to accelerate our 2021 market update from November to a virtual event on June 30. 
Now here's what you can expect at that update. We'll reiterate our disciplined philosophy for the business and how we expect to enhance our through-cycle performance for a volatile price world, but also for a more stable price world should that transpire. We'll reaffirm the allocation priorities that have been foundational to our company for years. Compared to our plan 2 years ago, we believe every part of the business has improved. And our goal is to put ConocoPhillips in an even better position to deliver multiple years of free cash flow and returns to shareholders post Concho. 
We'll provide an update on our outlook for 2021 and beyond. including our synergy capture progress and our business driver improvements. We'll also provide updates on our asset base and our ESG efforts and plans. As I said earlier, it's a busy time for the company, but we're going to take advantage of our momentum to reengage the market sooner rather than later on our compelling future. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill, who will address high-level quarterly results as well as our announced debt reduction and Synovis COP share plans."
296527,709831945,2268586,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. Well, we're certainly off to a good start in 2021. In today's posted materials, there's a summary of highlights from the first quarter, and I'll cover just a few of those items.

In today's posted materials, there's a summary of highlights from the first quarter, and I'll cover just a few of those items. As we foreshadowed on our March 31 market update, the financial results reflected some onetime contra-related items. Adjusted for these known items, underlying financial performance was very strong. Adjusted earnings were $0.69 per share versus $0.45 per share in the first quarter last year. Production came in at the high end of the range, and all producing segments generated positive earnings in the quarter. 
As shown in the cash waterfall in the supplemental materials posted on our website, first quarter cash from operations was $2.1 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion. These figures include the cash flow impacts related to previously announced contra-related items, which reduced both CFO and free cash flow by about $1 billion. But even with the roughly $1 billion in onetime transaction-related impacts, our CFO of $2.1 billion very nearly covered capital, dividends and buybacks. We returned 46% of CFO to shareholders in the quarter in the form of our ordinary dividend and share repurchases. And we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. 
As a reminder, we issued updated first quarter and full year 2021 guidance for key business drivers on March 31. And today, we provided updated cash and earnings sensitivities. I call your attention to these because our cash flow toward to the upside has improved significantly as a result of the Concho transaction. And in a more constructive price world, we're going to differentially capture the benefit of higher prices, because we're unhedged, we're liquids-weighted, and we have exposure to diverse markets globally. 
Turning to today's announcements, we view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, just like we do our portfolio of low cost of supply resource and our balance sheet is very strong with top-tier leverage due to our low net debt. Now of course, our cash balances are a component of our net debt and given that our borrowing costs exceed the returns on our cash, we plan to put some of that incremental cash to work along with future free cash flow to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next 5 years. This will reduce our ongoing interest expense, lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven price, improve returns and create greater flexibility on our overall debt structure, all while maintaining our strong leverage position. As part of our program, we may refinance some of our high coupon debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates and facilitate the total quantum of our debt reduction over time. 
Next, I'll address the Synovis share monetization plan we announced. As a reminder, we own approximately 10% of Synovis, which is valued at about $1.6 billion today. The shares were received as part of the consideration for our sale of Canadian assets to Synovis in 2017, and we've always stated that we did not intend to be a long-term strategic owner of Synovis shares. Over the years, we've looked at several strategies reducing our position. And we believe the market has responded to the positive steps Synovis has taken, including its recent commitments to balance sheet strength and operational efficiencies. We intend to begin selling our Synovis shares in the open market in the second quarter, while simultaneously tendering the proceeds in the ConocoPhillips shares. We will be thoughtful and measured with our sales program, as you would expect, with an intention to fully dispose of our Synovis position by the end of 2022. We believe this plan to swap Synovis shares for ConocoPhillips shares aligns well with both our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and to monetize our Synovis position. Taken together, our planned debt reduction and our planned swap of Synovis shares for ConocoPhillips shares further strengthen both our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to consistently deliver differential returns of capital to our shareholders, all while lowering our sustaining price. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tim for an update on the Lower 48 business."

We're just a few months into the ConocoPhillips-Concho integration process. And like Ryan and our other leaders, I'm more excited now than ever to tell you about our vision for the company and a great progress we've already made. I'll do a quick recap of the Lower 48 from the first quarter, which was nothing short of historic, not only because of a fast-paced integration activity but because of Winter Storm Uri. Overall, the storm impacted Lower 48 production by about 50,000 barrels a day for the quarter. However, facility damage from the storm was negligible, and we quickly resumed production in March. It was a heck of a test for our expanded Lower 48 region. They passed with flying colors. 
Total Lower 48 production for the quarter was 715,000 BOEs per day, which includes 405,000 in the Permian, 187,000 in the Eagle Ford and 86,000 in the Bakken. We exited the first quarter with 15 drilling rigs, 11 in the Permian and 4 in the Eagle Ford. And we had 7 frac spreads, 5 in the Permian and 2 in the Eagle Ford. It doesn't get a lot of attention, but I also wanted to mention that during the quarter, we executed several innovative pilots across the Lower 48, including more than 40 twin frac wells, electrification of our frac spreads and additional [ V5 ] completions. The point is, while we're executing the base business, we're also combining the experience of both companies by conducting numerous tests that should yield future efficiency gains. 
My entire Lower 48 organization is excited about the role we can play in making ConocoPhillips, a company that can supply the cheapest, cleanest barrels to the market successfully navigate the price cycles, achieve the highest level of execution efficiency and continue to lead the industry on the innovation front. From a size and scale perspective, our Lower 48 is clearly differentiated in the industry. With the acquisition of Concho, the Lower 48 grew to be about half of ConocoPhillips production and among the largest domestic producers. We have a high-quality set of assets with a low cost of supply resource base made up of core positions in the 3 premier tight oil basins in the world. Our Lower 48 team is focused on capturing the strategic advantages of both Concho and ConocoPhillips, to make our operations more efficient and drive down sustaining capital, with the primary goal of maximizing our cash-generating capacity. 
We're creating a massive free cash flow machine from our combined business that will contribute toward the company's ability to deliver on its priorities through cycles. All of us recognize that the largest opportunity for value creation is going to come from bringing the best out of both companies and elevating the combined ConocoPhillips to a level unachievable by either company on their own. I'm happy to say that the new organization has embraced this challenge and we are seeing even more opportunity than we had initially expected. 
I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of people we have working on this, starting with the Lower 48 leadership team, which consists of both heritage ConocoPhillips and Concho leaders. We made it a priority to work closely together and leverage the knowledge base of both very experienced operations. In fact, we continue to see substantial improvements in our well cost. We have our eyes on additional ways to get more for less. Beyond working together to generate the best plan of development and drive efficiencies in our operations, our team is working hard to identify commercial opportunities to improve margins as well as supply chain opportunities to leverage our global scale and drive down cost. 
I want to leave you with a strong sense of optimism about what the Lower 48 can deliver. We are fully dedicated to extracting the full value of this deal, and I'm looking forward to providing more detail at our midyear market update. And now I'll turn the call over to Nick to provide the status of our operations in the rest of the world."

While there's clearly a lot going on in our Lower 48 business, we believe ConocoPhillips has a significant advantage over our independent peers because we also have diverse global businesses that generate significant free cash flow. Today, ou",763,"Thanks, Tim. While there's clearly a lot going on in our Lower 48 business, we believe ConocoPhillips has a significant advantage over our independent peers because we also have diverse global businesses that generate significant free cash flow. Today, our Alaska and International businesses comprise about 50% of our company's operated 1.5 million barrels per day production. 
I'll take this opportunity to recap some of the achievements from the first quarter and bring you up to speed on activities we have underway around the globe. So starting in Alaska, I'm pleased to report that Greater Mooses Tooth 2 project has made significant progress over the past several months, and facility and construction costs are about 10% below budget as we finish our third and final construction season. The project is expected to be online by the end of this year at approximately 10,000 barrels a day, with peak production of 35,000 barrels a day that will leverage our existing Alpine infrastructure. 
We're also back to development drilling on the slope. After suspending virtually all activity in 2020, we are restarting 4 rigs across our operated assets in Alaska. In the Western North Slope, we restarted drilling at CD5 and commissioning activities on the new extended reach drilling rig. The ERD rig will play a significant role in augmenting Alaska's base business, allowing us to drill wells in excess of 35,000 feet, accessing low-cost supply resources while minimizing surface disturbance. So our base Alaska business is performing very well and we've built a strong momentum coming out of 2020. 
And of course, it's been an eventful quarter for Willow. Let me give you a quick update on where that project stands. We continue to progress the front-end engineering and design work, while at the same time, taking actions to address the legal challenges that have been recently raised. The 600 million-barrel oil discovery remains very competitive in our portfolio, but we won't take final investment decision or make significant long lead investments until the litigation risks have been resolved. 
Now moving to Canada. At Montney, we continue to optimize our development plans to incorporate the liquids-rich acreage we acquired from Kelt, mid last year. We're leveraging our Lower 48 unconventional resource expertise and a reduced drilling costs by 25% over the first 4 pads. This part of our business doesn't get a lot of external attention yet, but it's worth noting that's currently produced an approximately 30,000 barrels a day, of which 50% is liquids. We continue to be excited about our future in this premier 300,000-acre unconventional position. At Surmont, we continue to take actions to reduce costs, improve netbacks and reduce emissions, and we're seeing encouraging improvements on all 3 of these fronts. So in summary, Canada remains an important part of our business with quite a lot of upside and learning curve opportunities. 
Now moving to our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. In Norway, we've made good progress on several projects, which benefit from the fiscal incentives implemented by the Norwegian government last year. We're nearing completion of [ Port 2 ] and are on track to make final investment decisions on both Tommeliten Alpha and [ Kobra East Gecko ] later this year, and work continues to assess our recent discoveries at Barca and Slagugle. 
In Qatar, our QG3 asset continues to deliver very strong performance and generate free cash flow, and we continue to advance our evaluation of the North Field expansion opportunity. We're still very interested in participating in this project if it fits our financial framework. So we'll keep you posted as this plays out. 
Moving on into our Asia Pacific region. APLNG is running extremely well. Production continues to be strong, which when combined with ongoing focus on reducing capital, operating and financing costs has brought the cash breakeven down to $25 per barrel Brent. APLNG distributed almost $100 million to the company in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to distribute about $200 million in the second quarter. Finally, in Malaysia, we have several low cost of supply, high-margin bolt-on projects at various stages of development. The Malikai Phase 2 project achieved first oil in this year and [ SMP Phase 2 ] and [ Gumusut Phase 3 ] are on track for first oil in late 2021 and '22, respectively. 
So that's a brief update of our global operations. In summary, we have a lot of exciting work underway that will continue to enhance free cash flow generation. Now I'll turn it back to Ryan for some short closing comments."

So we see this as an opportunity to, one, trade into the COP shares, which we like to upside on; two, monetize an asset on the balance sheet, which we don't think gets a lot of value; and three, give that value back to shareholders."

Spare capacity still exists on the supply side, largely with the OPEC Group, or OPEC Plus. So we still view kind of 5 million, 6 million barrels a day of spare supply out in the world. So we still have a balancing that we need to do before we kind of see where the price falls out at that point in time and what the call is on say, U.S. tight oil going forward. So we think it's prudent to kind of stay the course right now and not change. We also don't want to whipsaw our programs. So we want to be stably executing our programs and driving the efficiencies that Tim and Nick talked about across the global portfolio with a lot of emphasis on what we're doing here in the U.S., in the Lower 48. So until the market gets rebalanced, we're doing all that, watching it before we make any differences as well. 
So we're positioning ConocoPhillips for any kind of market that we think enters the phrase. So if it is going to be volatile or if it's going to be sort of a sustained more stable kind of price, we're positioned to react to either one of those kinds of markets. It's a bit uncertain with the pandemic and the demand, how quickly that's going to recover. Now if you ask us, we believe it's going to recover. We think we probably hit 1 million or so barrels a day of demand later this year. And on an annual average, we expect 2022 to be at that kind of a demand level. So at that point in time, we would hope the market is balanced on a supply and demand perspective, but it's going to take really the remainder of this year to see that. But our value proposition is pretty firm and delivering money back to the shareholder like we described. And hopefully, you see from today's announcements that we're enhancing that. And again, the 30% is our floor. And you look over the last 5 years, we've delivered 43% of our cash back to our shareholders. So discipline matters and returns matter. And that's what we're all about."

Jeanine, so first, I just would start with both heritage Conoco and heritage Concho had really strong balance sheet, so does this combined company. And in fact, as we look at this, our net debt to CFO consensus is under 1x, materially less than our peer group. But with the contract transaction, our gross debt increased from $15 billion to $20 billion. And we have some legacy high coupon debt that's out there on our balance sheet. So we think this is a unique opportunity to reduce our ongoing interest and lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven. We think that improves returns. I think it creates greater flexibility in our debt structure and all this supports our ability to maintain greater than 30% of returns to our shareholders. 
When you think about why $5 billion, that's certainly over what the natural maturities of our bond ladders would be right now. We've got about $3 billion of bonds retiring over the next 5 years. So some of that will be early retirements. And you can see us do that with public tenders, open market repurchases or perhaps a combination with refinancing. All that's going to be taking approach that favors flexibility and optionality. And in the case of our $5 billion over 5 years, that is our base case. We think that gives us the ability to moderate the reduction and take advantage of supportive market conditions, but you may see us accelerate that a bit if efficiencies in the market allow us to do that earlier. So that's a bit of a context on why we're looking at reducing our debt structure, how we got to $5 billion and a bit on the pacing."

Why don't I start with Willow -- yes, I apologize, Josh. Let me start with Willow. First, the big focus this year is related to the front-end and engineering design, as I mentioned, as well as detailed engineering. That's all in related to reducing -- understanding our capital, the schedule and ultimate development considerations prior to taking FID later this year. That's the target. As a reminder for the group, they've got 2 lawsuits that are currently in federal court filed by 2 environmental groups, challenging the BLM and the Army Core record of decision for the Willow project. 
As you recall as well, we also had all the permits for the 2021 Willow construction received in early January. However, due to the granting of the injunction by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that 2021 activity, which was a very small, modest scope of gravel work, has been deferred into 2022. And as all projects, we have scheduled float or schedule continue to see, Josh. So that won't impact the overall time line. 
In addition to the fee that I just mentioned, the primary focus now relates to the merits of those active lawsuits, and we anticipate a decision by the District Court in the third quarter. I also want to just mention we have significant stakeholder support. As an example, we got State of Alaska and the North Slope Borough have both intervened in the court case supporting the BLM record decision. We also have several North Slope Village councils and tribal organizations who have sent strong letters of support to Congress and the Secretary of Interior. 
The last thing I'll just reiterate as part of my opening remarks, we will not take FID or make any significant long lead investments until such time as key litigation risks have been addressed. And finally, Willow is a great investment opportunity, and we have the flexibility to adjust the pace of the project if needed."

But I wouldn't -- I'd say we've gotten to a place where we understand in running the base business across the whole world is good, too. And so we understand the portfolio really well, obviously, and what the prospects look like over the long haul. 
You talked about the catalyst moment, it's really focused in what we want to convey today. It's every aspect of the business. So we talked about the balance sheet, we talked about returns back to the shareholder, we talked about the efficiencies that we're gaining in the system, post the Concho acquisition. So we're working really on every part, trying to lower the breakeven of the company and still be the best company in this business that can operate in a very volatile environment, and you can still count on the returns back to the shareholder, and you can count on us hyper-focused and disciplined on returns, not only on capital, but out of capital, both. 
So I think that's what you'll hear in June. A lot more on that, work on the portfolio, work on what we're doing across the whole company on every lever. We know what investors want. It's free cash flow and returns, and that's what we're hyper focused on."

I think our focus is on trying to lower the breakeven and lower the sustaining capital to work on the operating side of the business, lower the breakeven, which is reducing our interest expense by taking some of this high coupon debt and bringing it forward, giving us options to take that callable and reduce that in addition to what's coming out over time. 
So I think we're trying to do all things. And I think the basic commitment that we've made to the shareholders is we're going to return 30% of our cash or greater back to you over time. So we will do that. Now the vehicle, and I think part of your question was what's the right vehicle to do that in. That's, I guess, in the eye of the beholder a little bit. There's not maybe around what the right way to do that is we like the shares given the reduction that it makes in the absolute dividend, the per share metrics that it creates and the -- in the balance and the accepted way that it is done. 
But with that said, we've studied variable dividends and CBDs or whatever you want to call them going forward. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. Mathematically, it really doesn't matter. At the end of the day, the commitment is to return more than 30%. If there's a hybrid in our future, they could be. We'll -- we keep looking at it. And we're not committed to one path to deliver returns back to the shareholders. But today, we think our shares are a great value. So -- and we think this conversion from CVE to ConocoPhillips shares is an elegant solution to get more back to the shareholder. So we're pretty committed to that."

It's a very busy but exciting time at ConocoPhillips. With the Concho transaction now closed, our entire workforce is on a mission to emerge from last year's extreme sector volatility and the transaction integration activities as the strongest competitor in our business. 
Reviewing 2021 as a catalyst moment like we did in 2016 to improve every aspect of our business and again, step out from the pack by taking our disciplined, shareholder-friendly value proposition to the next level. We're taking actions across every aspect of the company to improve our underlying drivers, and our first quarter results represent an early indication of our progress.  
Some of the actions we're taking are transformational, such as capturing synergies, others are chipping away at core drivers to improve efficiency and returns, such as the debt reduction plans we announced this morning. Here's what everyone in our organization is focused on. First, we believe a safe company is a successful one. With the Concho transaction, we've combined 2 industry-recognized safety leaders, which has aided our overall integration. 
And again, I want to recognize our workforce for their exceptional handling of the many challenges presented by the Winter Storm Uri last quarter. We're continuously driving to lower the cost of supply of our diverse resource base. We have a deep inventory at the very best rocks, which is a clear source of sustained competitive advantage. And we're always working to further high-grade the portfolio through asset sales. 
But our low-cost inventory loan isn't enough. We're focused on applying our rigorous capital allocation process to optimize investments based on the metrics investors demand, free cash flow and returns. We're driving improvements in free cash flow and returns by driving down our sustaining capital through well cost and supply chain efficiencies as well as margin improvement, driving down our cost structure through synergies and balance sheet improvements, driving down our sustaining price through the combination of lower sustaining capital and lower cost structure. And finally, we don't cap the benefit from higher prices, which means upside in free cash flow above our sustaining price.  
We're only a short time into the Concho integration, but we're already seeing the previously announced synergies materialize, and we expect to yield additional benefits as our integration progresses. We remain committed to returning a significant portion of capital to our shareholders, with a 5-year track record of exceeding our target of greater than 30% of CFO. In fact, our return to shareholders since implementing our returns-focused strategy in 2016 has been 43% of cumulative CFO. 
So our capital return approach represents a floor on the level of capital returns, not a ceiling. We don't tie our returns to free cash flow like others are doing. So in other words, investors directly benefit from CFO expansion, including from higher prices when they occur.  
And as you saw in today's release, we're taking actions to further increase our returns of capital in 2021. In addition to our ordinary dividend and our previously announced $1.5 billion of buybacks, We intend to begin reducing our Cenovus ownership stake, using proceeds to purchase incremental ConocoPhillips stock. 
We're taking action to further strengthen our balance sheet. This morning, we also announced that we're planning to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next 5 years. This will reduce our annual interest expense cost and help lower our sustaining price. And finally, we're focused on leading in ESG, especially in emissions reductions. All of this is underpinned by our talented, motivated workforce. They are the driving force in our progress. 
You can tell from my comments that we're encouraged by the improvements we're seeing across the company. That's why we announced in today's press release, our intention to accelerate our 2021 market update from November to a virtual event on June 30. 
Now here's what you can expect at that update. We'll reiterate our disciplined philosophy for the business and how we expect to enhance our through-cycle performance for a volatile price world, but also for a more stable price world should that transpire. We'll reaffirm the allocation priorities that have been foundational to our company for years. Compared to our plan 2 years ago, we believe every part of the business has improved. And our goal is to put ConocoPhillips in an even better position to deliver multiple years of free cash flow and returns to shareholders post Concho.
We'll provide an update on our outlook for 2021 and beyond. including our synergy capture progress and our business driver improvements. We'll also provide updates on our asset base and our ESG efforts and plans. As I said earlier, it's a busy time for the company, but we're going to take advantage of our momentum to reengage the market sooner rather than later on our compelling future.  
Now let me turn the call over to Bill, who will address high-level quarterly results as well as our announced debt reduction and Cenovus-COP share plans."
296527,709831945,2268921,"ConocoPhillips, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. Well, we're certainly off to a good start in 2021. In today's posted materials, there's a summary of highlights from the first quarter, and I'll cover just a few of those items.

In today's posted materials, there's a summary of highlights from the first quarter, and I'll cover just a few of those items. As we foreshadowed on our March 31 market update, the financial results reflected some onetime contra-related items. Adjusted for these known items, underlying financial performance was very strong. Adjusted earnings were $0.69 per share versus $0.45 per share in the first quarter last year. Production came in at the high end of the range, and all producing segments generated positive earnings in the quarter.  
As shown in the cash waterfall in the supplemental materials posted on our website, first quarter cash from operations was $2.1 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion. These figures include the cash flow impacts related to previously announced contra-related items, which reduced both CFO and free cash flow by about $1 billion. But even with the roughly $1 billion in onetime transaction-related impacts, our CFO of $2.1 billion very nearly covered capital, dividends and buybacks. We returned 46% of CFO to shareholders in the quarter in the form of our ordinary dividend and share repurchases. And we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion of cash and short-term investments.
As a reminder, we issued updated first quarter and full year 2021 guidance for key business drivers on March 31. And today, we provided updated cash and earnings sensitivities. I call your attention to these because our cash flow toward to the upside has improved significantly as a result of the Concho transaction. And in a more constructive price world, we're going to differentially capture the benefit of higher prices, because we're unhedged, we're liquids-weighted, and we have exposure to diverse markets globally.
Turning to today's announcements, we view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, just like we do our portfolio of low cost to supply resource and our balance sheet is very strong with top-tier leverage due to our low net debt. Now of course, our cash balances are a component of our net debt and given that our borrowing costs exceed the returns on our cash, we plan to put some of that incremental cash to work along with future free cash flow to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next 5 years. 
This will reduce our ongoing interest expense, lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven price, improve returns and create greater flexibility on our overall debt structure, all while maintaining our strong leverage position. As part of our program, we may refinance some of our high coupon debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates and facilitate the total quantum of our debt reduction over time.  
Next, I'll address the Cenovus share monetization plan we announced. As a reminder, we own approximately 10% of Cenovus, which is valued at about $1.6 billion today. The shares were received as part of the consideration for our sale of Canadian assets to Cenovus in 2017, and we've always stated that we did not intend to be a long-term strategic owner of Cenovus shares. 
Over the years, we've looked at several strategies reducing our position. We believe the market has responded to the positive steps Cenovus has taken, including its recent commitments to balance sheet strength and operational efficiencies. We intend to begin selling our Cenovus shares in the open market in the second quarter, while simultaneously tendering the proceeds in the ConocoPhillips shares. 
We will be thoughtful and measured with our sales program, as you would expect, with an intention to fully dispose of our Cenovus position by the end of 2022. We believe this plan to swap Cenovus shares for ConocoPhillips shares aligns well with both our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and to monetize our Cenovus position. 
Taken together, our planned debt reduction and our planned swap of Cenovus shares for ConocoPhillips shares further strengthen both our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to consistently deliver differential returns of capital to our shareholders, all while lowering our sustaining price.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Tim for an update on the Lower 48 business."

We're just a few months into the ConocoPhillips-Concho integration process. And like Ryan and our other leaders, I'm more excited now than ever to tell you about our vision for the company and the great progress we've already made. 
I'll do a quick recap of the Lower 48 from the first quarter, which was nothing short of historic, not only because of a fast-paced integration activity, but because of Winter Storm Uri. Overall, the storm impacted Lower 48 production by about 50,000 barrels a day for the quarter. However, facility damage from the storm was negligible, and we quickly resumed production in March. It was a heck of a test for our expanded Lower 48 region. They passed with flying colors.
Total Lower 48 production for the quarter was 715,000 BOEs per day, which includes 405,000 in the Permian, 187,000 in the Eagle Ford and 86,000 in the Bakken. We exited the first quarter with 15 drilling rigs, 11 in the Permian and 4 in the Eagle Ford. And we had 7 frac spreads, 5 in the Permian and 2 in the Eagle Ford. 
It doesn't get a lot of attention, but I also wanted to mention that during the quarter, we executed several innovative pilots across the Lower 48, including more than 40 twin frac wells. Electrification of our frac spreads and additional V5 completions. The point is, while we're executing the base business, we're also combining the experience of both companies by conducting numerous tests that should yield future efficiency gains.  
My entire Lower 48 organization is excited about the role we can play in making ConocoPhillips, a company that can supply the cheapest, cleanest barrels to the market, successfully navigate the price cycles, achieve the highest level of execution efficiency and continue to lead the industry on the innovation front. From a size and scale perspective, our Lower 48 is clearly differentiated in the industry.  
With the acquisition of Concho, the Lower 48 grew to be about half of ConocoPhillips' production and among the largest domestic producers. We have a high-quality set of assets with a low cost of supply resource base made up of core positions in the 3 premier tight oil basins in the world. Our Lower 48 team is focused on capturing the strategic advantages of both Concho and ConocoPhillips, to make our operations more efficient and drive down sustaining capital with the primary goal of maximizing our cash-generating capacity.
We're creating a massive free cash flow machine from our combined business that will contribute toward the company's ability to deliver on its priorities through cycles. All of us recognize that the largest opportunity for value creation is going to come from bringing the best out of both companies and elevating the combined ConocoPhillips to a level unachievable by either company on their own. I'm happy to say that the new organization has embraced this challenge and we are seeing even more opportunity than we had initially expected.
I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of people we have working on this, starting with the Lower 48 leadership team, which consists of both heritage ConocoPhillips and Concho leaders. We made it a priority to work closely together and leverage the knowledge base of both very experienced operations. In fact, we continue to see substantial improvements in our well cost. We have our eyes on additional ways to get more for less. 
Beyond working together to generate the best plan of development and drive efficiencies in our operations, our team is working hard to identify commercial opportunities to improve margins as well as supply chain opportunities to leverage our global scale and drive down cost.  
I want to leave you with a strong sense of optimism about what the Lower 48 can deliver. We are fully dedicated to extracting the full value of this deal, and I'm looking forward to providing more detail at our midyear market update. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Nick to provide the status of our operations in the rest of the world."

Today, ou",755,"Thanks, Tim. While there's clearly a lot going on in our Lower 48 business, we believe ConocoPhillips has a significant advantage over our independent peers because we also have diverse global businesses that generate significant free cash flow. Today, our Alaska and International businesses comprise about 50% of our company's operated 1.5 million barrels per day production. I'll take this opportunity to recap some of the achievements from the first quarter and bring you up to speed on activities we have underway around the globe. 
So starting in Alaska, I'm pleased to report that Greater Mooses Tooth 2 project has made significant progress over the past several months, and facility and construction costs are about 10% below budget as we finish our third and final construction season. The project is expected to be online by the end of this year at approximately 10,000 barrels a day, with peak production of 35,000 barrels a day that will leverage our existing Alpine infrastructure.  
We're also back to development drilling on the slope. After suspending virtually all activity in 2020, we are restarting 4 rigs across our operated assets in Alaska. In the Western North Slope, we restarted drilling at CD5 and commissioning activities on the new extended reach drilling rig. The ERD rig will play a significant role in augmenting Alaska's base business, allowing us to drill wells in excess of 35,000 feet, accessing low-cost supply resources while minimizing surface disturbance. So our base Alaska business is performing very well and we've built a strong momentum coming out of 2020.
And of course, it's been an eventful quarter for Willow. Let me give you a quick update on where that project stands. We continue to progress the front-end engineering and design work, while at the same time, taking actions to address the legal challenges that have been recently raised. The 600 million-barrel oil discovery remains very competitive in our portfolio, but we won't take final investment decision or make significant long lead investments until the litigation risks have been resolved.  
Now moving to Canada. At Montney, we continue to optimize our development plans to incorporate the liquids-rich acreage we acquired from Kelt, mid last year. We're leveraging our Lower 48 unconventional resource expertise and a reduced drilling costs by 25% over the first 4 pads. This part of our business doesn't get a lot of external attention yet, but it's worth noting that's currently produced an approximately 30,000 barrels a day, of which 50% is liquids. We continue to be excited about our future in this premier 300,000-acre unconventional position. 
At Surmont, we continue to take actions to reduce costs, improve netbacks and reduce emissions, and we're seeing encouraging improvements on all 3 of these fronts. So in summary, Canada remains an important part of our business, with quite a lot of upside and learning curve opportunities.
Now moving to our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment. In Norway, we've made good progress on several projects, which benefit from the fiscal incentives implemented by the Norwegian government last year. We're nearing completion of Tor II and are on track to make final investment decisions on both Tommeliten Alpha and Kobra East Gekko later this year, and work continues to assess our recent discoveries at Warka and Slagugle.
In Qatar, our QG3 asset continues to deliver very strong performance and generate free cash flow, and we continue to advance our evaluation of the North Field expansion opportunity. We're still very interested in participating in this project if it fits our financial framework. So we'll keep you posted as this plays out.  
Moving on into our Asia Pacific region. APLNG is running extremely well. Production continues to be strong, which when combined with ongoing focus on reducing capital, operating and financing costs has brought the cash breakeven down to $25 per barrel Brent. APLNG distributed almost $100 million to the company in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to distribute about $200 million in the second quarter. 
Finally, in Malaysia, we have several low cost of supply, high-margin bolt-on projects at various stages of development. The Malikai Phase 2 project achieved first oil in this year and SNP Phase 2 and Gumusut Phase 3 are on track for first oil in late 2021 and '22, respectively.
So that's a brief update of our global operations. In summary, We have a lot of exciting work underway that will continue to enhance free cash flow generation. Now I'll turn it back to Ryan for some short closing comments."

It certainly seems like the supply side is responding well and prices are firmer, but demand is still uncertain. So Ryan, how are you thinking about the Brent price outlook from here and the sustainability of the recovery? Any thoughts on the natural gas side -- global natural gas side as well as that's firmed up nicely as well?"

Thanks, Neil. No, we continue to kind of execute the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and it's largely due to our view of the macro, as you kind of described, demand still is off to pre-pandemic levels at, pick a number, 96 million, 97 million barrels a day of demand. Spare capacity still exists on the supply side, largely with the OPEC Group, or OPEC Plus. So we still view kind of 5 million, 6 million barrels a day of spare supply out in the world. 
So we still have a balancing that we need to do before we kind of see where the price falls out at that point in time and what the call is on, say, U.S. tight oil going forward. So we think it's prudent to kind of stay the course right now and not change. We also don't want to whipsaw our programs. So we want to be stably executing our programs and driving the efficiencies that Tim and Nick talked about across the global portfolio with a lot of emphasis on what we're doing here in the U.S., in the Lower 48. So until the market gets rebalanced, we're doing all that, watching it before we make any differences as well. 
So we're positioning ConocoPhillips for any kind of market that we think enters the fray. So if it is going to be volatile or if it's going to be sort of a sustained more stable kind of price, we're positioned to react to either one of those kinds of markets. It's a bit uncertain with the pandemic and the demand, how quickly that's going to recover. 
Now if you ask us, we believe it's going to recover. We think we probably hit 1 million or so barrels a day of demand later this year. And on an annual average, we expect 2022 to be at that kind of a demand level. So at that point in time, we would hope the market is balanced on a supply and demand perspective, but it's going to take really the remainder of this year to see that. 
But our value proposition is pretty firm and delivering money back to the shareholder like we described. And hopefully, you see from today's announcements that we're enhancing that. And again, the 30% is our floor. And you look over the last 5 years, we've delivered 43% of our cash back to our shareholders. So discipline matters and returns matter. And that's what we're all about."

So it's not a ratable, you can't just take the first quarter times four. But we are driving the teams to greater efficiency and trying to get as much done with the precious capital dollar that we can. We'll provide more of an update in the June update that we've talked about.

We designed our programs at the beginning of the year and asked our teams to go execute that scope and really not interested in trying to drive that on a quarterly basis and whipsaw the teams around doing those programs.

Jeanine, so first, I just would start with both heritage Conoco and heritage Concho had really strong balance sheet, so does this combined company. And in fact, as we look at this, our net debt to CFO consensus is under 1x, materially less than our peer group. But with the contract transaction, our gross debt's increased from $15 billion to $20 billion. And we have some legacy high coupon debt that's out there on our balance sheet. 
So we think this is a unique opportunity to reduce our ongoing interest and lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven. We think that improves returns. I think it creates greater flexibility in our debt structure and all this supports our ability to maintain greater than 30% of returns to our shareholders.
When you think about why $5 billion? Well, that's certainly over what the natural maturities of our bond ladders would be right now. We've got about $3 billion of bonds retiring over the next 5 years. So some of that will be early retirements. And you can see us do that with public tenders, open market repurchases or perhaps a combination with refinancing. 
All that's going to be taking approach that favors flexibility and optionality. And in the case of our $5 billion over 5 years, that is our base case. We think that gives us the ability to moderate the reduction and take advantage of supportive marketing conditions, but you may see us accelerate that a bit if efficiencies in the market allow us to do that earlier. 
So that's a bit of a context on why we're looking at reducing our debt structure, how we got to $5 billion and a bit on the pacing."

As a reminder for the group, they've got 2 lawsuits that are currently in federal court filed by 2 environmental groups, challenging the BLM and the Army Core record of decision for the Willow project. As you recall as well, we also had all the permits for the 2021 Willow construction received in early January. 
However, due to the granting of the injunction by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that 2021 activity, which was a very small, modest scope of gravel work has been deferred into 2022. And as all projects, we have scheduled float or scheduled contingency, Josh. So that won't impact the overall time line.
In addition to the fee that I just mentioned, the primary focus now relates to the merits of those active lawsuits, and we anticipate a decision by the District Court in the third quarter. I also want to just mention we have significant stakeholder support. As an example, we got State of Alaska and The North Slope Borough have both intervened in the court case supporting the BLM record decision. We also have several North Slope Village councils and tribal organizations who have sent strong letters of support to Congress and the Secretary of Interior. 
The last thing I'll just reiterate as part of my opening remarks, we will not take FID or make any significant long lead investments until such time as key litigation risks have been addressed.

If I -- sorry, you were breaking up there a little bit, Doug, if I understand your question right, how do we make all those balances? I think we're walking and chewing gum at the same time here a little bit. So we're working on all aspects of the portfolio. I think our focus is on trying to lower the breakeven and lower the sustaining capital to work on the operating side of the business, lower the breakeven, which is reducing our interest expense by taking some of this high coupon debt and bringing it forward, giving us options to take that callable and reduce that in addition to what's coming out over time. 
So I think we're trying to do all things. And I think the basic commitment that we've made to the shareholders is we're going to return 30% of our cash or greater back to you over time. So we will do that. Now the vehicle, and I think part of your question was what's the right vehicle to do that in. That's, I guess, in the eye of the beholder a little bit. There's not maybe around what the right way to do that is we like the shares given the reduction that it makes in the absolute dividend, the per share metrics that it creates and the -- and the balance and the accepted way that its done. 
But with that said, we've studied variable dividends and CBDs or whatever you want to call them going forward. We spend a lot of time thinking about it. Mathematically, it really doesn't matter. At the end of the day, the commitment is to return more than 30%. If there's a hybrid in our future, they could be. We'll -- we keep looking at it. And we're not committed to one path to deliver returns back to the shareholders. 
But today, we think our shares are a great value. So -- and we think this conversion from CVE to ConocoPhillips shares is an elegant solution to get more back to the shareholder. So we're pretty committed to that."

And also that -- on that basis that when you're talking to your peers with the commodity prices much stronger and the share performance much better today comparing to a year ago, how is that conversation on the consolidation trend that in the industry has changed? Do you think that the consolidation trends are essentially over by now? Or that still has opportunity? 
The second question is that when I looked at the full year production guidance of 1.5 million barrels per day, your first half is roughly 1.5 million based on the midpoint of the second quarter. But when we think that second quarter probably have some maintenance downtime, perhaps that a little bit higher than the second half, so is there any reason why the full year or that the second half production will not be higher than the 1.5 million barrel per day implied estimate that you gave?"

So we are really focused on making sure we get the Concho assets integrated in. Tim is doing a great job with his team in the Lower 48 and on the efficiency side. I think it manifests itself in the performance of the company in the first quarter and in the production performance despite having the impacts from Winter Storm Uri.

Today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our June 30 market update, during which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company. The update was widely followed and we received some pretty positive feedback.",1124,"Thank you, Ellen. Today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our June 30 market update, during which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company. The update was widely followed and we received some pretty positive feedback. As you'd expect, given the recency of our update, there isn't much incremental news to share at this time, except to say we remain convinced it was timely and relevant, given the ongoing volatility we're seeing in the sector. And today, we're pleased to follow it up with the very strong quarterly results we announced this morning. 
As you'll recall, we kicked off our update by declaring that we believe we're at a defining moment for the E&P sector and that persists today. Oil equities have been especially volatile recently, in part due to uncertainties in the macro and because we know investors need to see evidence that sector discipline will hold and returns on and of capital will follow. It's clear to us that long-term sector sponsorship requires leadership on the part of companies as well as conviction on the part of investors. 
Of course, for investors, the case for these equities requires a reasonably constructive macro view. The case for equities also requires conviction around a micro view, in other words, who is best positioned for the cyclical business realities and who has a track record of execution and performance and who can truly lead in ESG. Most companies are espousing the virtues of discipline, and everyone now looks better coming out of the 2020 downturn. 
The questions investors need to consider is, who can deliver consistent returns-focused performance through thick and thin? That's where leadership matters. In June, we met this defining moment with a credible and highly investable plan that generates massive free cash flow and returns of capital with financial returns that are competitive with the S&P. The leadership requires more than setting expectations and plans. It also requires successfully executing them. Execution is where the rubber meets the road. ConocoPhillips offers a unique combination of a credible and compelling investment plan with a commitment to strong ongoing execution. 
You saw that -- you saw the plan in June, and today, you see the execution. In other words, you're seeing the June plan at work. This morning's release and supplementary information provided details on this quarter's performance so I won't restate them. But here are a few key takeaways and themes that I want to underscore. During the second quarter, the business ran extremely well. Our planned turnaround activity went smoothly, as did our ongoing core programs across the company. These include activities in the North American channel plays as well as in the multiple programs in our Alaska and international regions. 
While we're talking about execution, I'll also mention that we continue to make good progress on more than 50 emission reduction projects that we have underway this year. Every part of our business has a role in delivering our results, and I'm proud of our team for their accomplishments during a very busy year. Overall, this quarter's financial results were really quite straightforward. The noise of 2020's market upheavals and most of the Concho transaction adjustments are behind us. And the known deal integration synergies and streamlining impacts we discussed in June are showing up in our performance. 
We're on track to meet the updated 2021 guidance we issued a month ago, but we're not done, not done with our efforts to continue driving the operational and underlying efficiencies the team has described in our June material. We can't ignore that higher benchmark prices were a factor in this quarter's sector performance broadly and certainly, ConocoPhillips specifically. However, what is somewhat unique to ConocoPhillips is that our results demonstrate the capacity of our company to capture the benefit of higher prices when they do occur. That's because we're unhedged, we're diversified and we're almost entirely intact in royalty regimes. 
Now a year ago, we demonstrated just how resilient we are to low prices. 12 months later and post-Concho transaction, this quarter gives you a sense for the upside toward we can realize when prices exceed the reference prices we showed you just 1 month ago. The clear bottom line, ConocoPhillips works differentially through the cycles. 
Cash from operations of $4 billion more than covered our capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and distributions of $1.2 billion in the quarter. And importantly, we continue to meet and exceed our target of returning greater than 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. We announced another increase to our 2021 distributions in June, bringing our total planned returns of capital to about $6 billion for the year, representing almost 8% of our market cap today, while other companies are only announcing or just reactivating such programs. 
And of course, as Bill described in our market update, if prices continue at current levels, we would expect to have additional cash that could go towards greater distributions. And for reference,  we estimate full year 2021 CFO at $50 per barrel WTI would be about $11 billion after adjusting for the onetime Concho transaction-related impacts. And you can do the math on our sensitivities at roughly $300 million per $1 per barrel change in prices. 
At this time, we still believe our distribution allocation of nearly 3% yielding ordinary dividend and share repurchases is a very sound mix, but we continue to evaluate the issue and we want to engage with the market on alternative allocations. We know there isn't a perfect answer but we know what matters, and that's a credible commitment to return capital and a solid track record of reliable performance, which we've certainly delivered now for multiple years. 
So to summarize, we have a great shareholder-friendly business model and plan. We're hitting our stride after a busy time and putting the execution runs on the board. We're maintaining our discipline. The company is running extremely well, and we're not done with our work to improve underlying financial returns on capital employed. That's the goal. That's how we enlist long-term market sponsorship and that's what ConocoPhillips is all about. 
We're pleased to be where we're at here at midyear but we recognize the year is still young. Looking forward to the second half of 2021, our priorities are squarely focused on executing our remaining plans and programs for this year. Meanwhile, we're closely watching how the macro evolves and beginning our internal process of setting our 2022 budget and capital plan. We'll stay actively engaged with the market and look forward to ongoing discussions about how our plans are progressing. So let me turn the call over to the operator and we'll begin the Q&A portion of the call."

I'll start on the M&A side, I'll let Bill chime in on your second question. When we think about the market, our approach is to constantly know what assets that we like, and we constantly are reviewing the portfolio to look at the pieces inside the portfolio that are uncompetitive. So we're constantly screening opportunities to both buy and sell assets and we're constantly trying to high-grade the portfolio. 
I think the environment that we see today, certainly, it feels like more assets tend to come to the market. But I don't think that makes it necessarily a buyer's or a seller's market today. I think what matters to us is just to keep at the rigor and the discipline that we've described back in 2019, we continue through today and continue through the Concho transaction that we did earlier back in January. And that's just the rigor of our disciplined framework around cost of supply and value and simply being patient, Neil. I think the market may require that even now more than ever. So I think that's a bit about how we think about the inorganic side of the business. Now maybe turn it over to Bill and he can comment on the cash flow."
296527,1672666773,2360831,"ConocoPhillips, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Sure. Neil, this is Bill. It was a very clean quarter on a cash basis. It was clean for both cash and it was clean for both earnings. As you're looking at your run rate, I'd point you to just 2 items to consider though. The first one, and we mentioned thi",337,"Sure. Neil, this is Bill. It was a very clean quarter on a cash basis. It was clean for both cash and it was clean for both earnings. As you're looking at your run rate, I'd point you to just 2 items to consider though. The first one, and we mentioned this in the press release is that we did make a $200 million discretionary pension plan contribution in the second quarter. That reduced our second quarter CFO, and the contribution increased the pension plan's funding status above 90% and that eliminated the need to pay the PBGC premium payments. It also leads to reduced financial statement volatility for the pension and reduces some of our go-forward funding requirements. So that really did make good sense for use of cash to us in the quarter. And so I draw that to your attention as a reduction in run rate. 
And the other 1 that I point out as you're thinking about run rates would be our APLNG distributions. We received distributions of $250 million from APLNG in the second quarter. That brings year-to-date about $350 million. And we anticipate about $100 million in the third quarter and $700 million for the year. So just as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher distribution in the second and fourth quarters as you're thinking about the run rates on that. And that -- those APLNG distributions are pretty locked in for the year because of long-term LNG sales, LNG are price lagged and so there's very little sensitivity to that for the remainder of the year. 
And so as you're thinking about how to look at run rates for the rest of the year, I'd direct you to our sensitivities that we provide, those still hold. And a good rule of thumb is about $300 million annualized cash flow for every [ $1 million ] change in WTI. And with those, you ought to be pretty bang on with CFO sensitivities."

I think if you're a pure-play 1-basin kind of operator, you're probably going to experience certain categories of spend that are inflating. I think the advantage that ConocoPhillips has right now is we're still capturing a lot of the best practices and the synergies from the Concho transaction plus the fact that we're a global diversified company. So other areas around the world are not inflating maybe like some of the economies that are leading the recovery from the COVID pandemic. 
So I think we're able to differentiate ourselves in that regard pretty clearly. We think it's imminently manageable this year and as we go into next year. And I would add 1 other thing that seems to be missing a little bit from the conversation, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, and that's the unhedged nature of our portfolio. I'm just surprised to hear the analysts aren't asking the question to the E&Ps that are hedged, what happened. You could -- there could even be more cash flow if you hadn't hedged your position. You shouldn't expect that from ConocoPhillips. We'll get the torque from the upside on the prices as we described in my opening comments.

I mean, we -- of course, we are seeing some inflation in tubulars, cement in the Lower 48, some pressure on frac crews.

Yes, as far as uses of cash, we've communicated before and broadly, we like to carry some of the cash on the balance sheet for strategic and reserve and operating purposes, and we've described that in quite a lot of detail in the past. I think with the commodity price environment that we're seeing today, the balance sheet's in great shape, as Bill described earlier on the last question. So I think as we get incremental free cash flow above and beyond our means, we're not necessarily looking to continue to build a lot of cash on the balance sheet. 
Shareholders should expect that they start getting incremental returns, if the -- if our view of the commodity prices continues to hold. We've seen how volatile that can be and the fact that the market is still pretty imbalanced. Demand is yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and you got arguably 5 million or more barrels a day of spare supply sitting in the market. So we still expect quite a lot of volatility, which is why we like the strength of the balance sheet that we have today and holding some cash on that balance sheet.

I can let Bill talk about the the way we view deferred taxes over the course of the plan that you're referring to.

But they only account for about 22% of the current production of about roughly 7 million barrels a day, probably increases the bid because they are pretty active, to your point. 
I think generally, as we think about it going forward, they run out of some of their best acreage over the next couple of years. So we don't see them having an outsized impact on the growth coming from the tight oil and being a dominant driver to U.S. production growth. That's really going to depend on the strong public companies like ConocoPhillips that have the best rocks and the higher-quality rock versus the private companies. So I think that's really the area to continue to focus on. Although we see, as well as you do, in the short term, some of the incremental production that's coming out of the private operators. 
We're certainly taking advantage of the commodity price environment that don't have maybe the investor pressure on discipline and returns of capital back to their shareholders while they're trying to increase the value of their properties as they go forward. So while a short-term thing, we don't think it will be a long-term driver to what the U.S. tight oil play looks like. So let me ask Bill to chime in on the deferred tax question."

I think I go back to our original sideboards is the fairway that we've described to the -- to our shareholders to our owners is that you should expect greater than 30% of our cash returning back to our shareholders. That's on a quarterly and an annual basis. And if you look back at our history in the last 5 years, that's averaged over 40%. 
So I think -- and that's really the differentiation between our model for return of capital back to shareholders and maybe some of the others that we've been reading about and that we've been hearing about because it's not free cash flow-based. It is CFO-based. So as CFO grows because commodity prices are up, the shareholders should expect to get more distribution. Now we've chosen the -- in our ordinary dividend, we've said we want to be competitive. We want to grow that competitively with the S&P. That's how we're measuring ourselves. That's how we're measuring our performance of return on capital, and that's how we're measuring our performance of return of capital with respect to the ordinary dividend. 
And then -- but we want that ordinary dividend to be resilient through the cycles. So we don't want to -- we want to be able to afford it at the low end of the cycle, which we demonstrated last year through the pandemic. And then we recognize, as we get additional torque that we described with higher prices, because our cash flow is going to grow and our returns to our shareholders should grow as well. You should expect that to come. And at a minimum, it's going to be 30%. So it's not a free cash flow-based model. We think about it as a CFO-based model. 
And as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to watch what the best distribution channel, maybe it's a combination, maybe it's a hybrid down the road. We'll continue to watch that. But today, we feel like our shares are a great buy in the market. So the channel that we've chosen right now at this [ 10 seconds ] is to the strong ordinary dividend. It's yielding what it is today, combined with returning -- meeting our threshold of greater than 30% through the share buyback channel."

But I pivot back to what's important is the shareholders are going to get 30% of our cash flow or more on an ongoing basis. So you will get it.

Today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our June 30 market update, during which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company.

Today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our June 30 market update, during which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company. The update was widely followed and we received some pretty positive feedback. As you'd expect, given the recency of our update, there isn't much incremental news to share at this time, except to say we remain convinced it was timely and relevant, given the ongoing volatility we're seeing in the sector. And today, we're pleased to follow it up with the very strong quarterly results we announced this morning.  
As you'll recall, we kicked off our update by declaring that we believe we're at a defining moment for the E&P sector and that persists today. Oil equities have been especially volatile recently, in part due to uncertainties in the macro and because we know investors need to see evidence that sector discipline will hold and returns on and of capital will follow. It's clear to us that long-term sector sponsorship requires leadership on the part of companies as well as conviction on the part of investors.  
Of course, for investors, the case for these equities requires a reasonably constructive macro view. The case for equities also requires conviction around a micro view. in other words, who is best positioned for the cyclical business realities and who has a track record of execution and performance and who can truly lead in ESG. Most companies are espousing the virtues of discipline, and everyone now looks better coming out of the 2020 downturn.  
The questions investors need to consider is, who can deliver consistent returns-focused performance through thick and thin? That's where leadership matters. In June, we met this defining moment with a credible and highly investable plan that generates massive free cash flow and returns of capital with financial returns that are competitive with the S&P. The leadership requires more than setting expectations and plans. It also requires successfully executing them. Execution is where the rubber meets the road. ConocoPhillips offers a unique combination of a credible and compelling investment plan with a commitment to strong ongoing execution.  
You saw that -- you saw the plan in June, and today, you see the execution. In other words, you're seeing the June plan at work. This morning's release and supplementary information provided details on this quarter's performance so I won't restate them. But here are a few key takeaways and themes that I want to underscore. During the second quarter, the business ran extremely well. Our planned turnaround activity went smoothly, as did our ongoing core programs across the company. These include activities in the North American channel plays as well as in the multiple programs in our Alaska and international regions.  
While we're talking about execution, I'll also mention that we continue to make good progress on more than 50 emission reduction projects that we have underway this year. Every part of our business has a role in delivering our results, and I'm proud of our team for their accomplishments during a very busy year. Overall, this quarter's financial results were really quite straightforward. The noise of 2020's market upheavals and most of the Concho transaction adjustments are behind us. And the known deal integration synergies and streamlining impacts we discussed in June are showing up in our performance.  
We're on track to meet the updated 2021 guidance we issued a month ago, but we're not done, not done with our efforts to continue driving the operational and underlying efficiencies the team has described in our June material. We can't ignore that higher benchmark prices were a factor in this quarter's sector performance broadly and certainly, ConocoPhillips specifically. However, what is somewhat unique to ConocoPhillips is that our results demonstrate the capacity of our company to capture the benefit of higher prices when they do occur. That's because we're unhedged, we're diversified and we're almost entirely intact in royalty regimes.  
Now a year ago, we demonstrated just how resilient we are to low prices. 12 months later and post-Concho transaction, this quarter gives you a sense for the upside toward we can realize when prices exceed the reference prices we showed you just 1 month ago. The clear bottom line, ConocoPhillips works differentially through the cycles.  
Cash from operations of $4 billion more than covered our capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and distributions of $1.2 billion in the quarter. And importantly, we continue to meet and exceed our target of returning greater than 30% of our CFO to our shareholders. We announced another increase to our 2021 distributions in June, bringing our total planned returns of capital to about $6 billion for the year, representing almost 8% of our market cap today, while other companies are only announcing or just reactivating such programs.  
And of course, as Bill described in our market update, if prices continue at current levels, we would expect to have additional cash that could go towards greater distributions. And for reference,  we estimate full year 2021 CFO at $50 per barrel WTI would be about $11 billion after adjusting for the onetime Concho transaction-related impacts. And you can do the math on our sensitivities at roughly $300 million per $1 per barrel change in prices.  
At this time, we still believe our distribution allocation of nearly 3% yielding ordinary dividend and share repurchases is a very sound mix, but we continue to evaluate the issue and we want to engage with the market on alternative allocations. We know there isn't a perfect answer but we know what matters, and that's a credible commitment to return capital and a solid track record of reliable performance, which we've certainly delivered now for multiple years.  
So to summarize, we have a great shareholder-friendly business model and plan. We're hitting our stride after a busy time and putting the execution runs on the board. We're maintaining our discipline. The company is running extremely well, and we're not done with our work to improve underlying financial returns on capital employed. That's the goal. That's how we enlist long-term market sponsorship and that's what ConocoPhillips is all about.  
We're pleased to be where we're at here at midyear but we recognize the year is still young. Looking forward to the second half of 2021, our priorities are squarely focused on executing our remaining plans and programs for this year. Meanwhile, we're closely watching how the macro evolves and beginning our internal process of setting our 2022 budget and capital plan. We'll stay actively engaged with the market and look forward to ongoing discussions about how our plans are progressing. So let me turn the call over to the operator and we'll begin the Q&A portion of the call."

I think the environment that we see today, certainly, it feels like more assets tend to come to the market. But I don't think that makes it necessarily a buyer's or a seller's market today. I think what matters to us is just to keep at the rigor and the discipline that we've described back in 2019. We continue through today and continue through the Concho transaction that we did earlier back in January. And that's just the rigor of our disciplined framework around cost of supply and value and simply being patient, Neil. I think the market may require that even now more than ever. So I think that's a bit about how we think about the inorganic side of the business. Now maybe turn it over to Bill and he can comment on the cash flow."

It was a very clean quarter on a cash basis. It was clean for both cash and it was clean for both earnings. As you're looking at your run rate, I'd point you to just 2 items to consider though. The first one, and we mentioned thi",335,"Sure. Neil, this is Bill. It was a very clean quarter on a cash basis. It was clean for both cash and it was clean for both earnings. As you're looking at your run rate, I'd point you to just 2 items to consider though. The first one, and we mentioned this in the press release is that we did make a $200 million discretionary pension plan contribution in the second quarter. That reduced our second quarter CFO, and the contribution increased the pension plan's funding status above 90% and that eliminated the need to pay the PBGC premium payments. It also leads to reduced financial statement volatility for the pension and reduces some of our go-forward funding requirements. So that really did make good sense for use of cash to us in the quarter. And so I draw that to your attention as a reduction in run rate.  
And the other 1 that I point out as you're thinking about run rates would be our APLNG distributions. We received distributions of $250 million from APLNG in the second quarter. That brings year-to-date about $350 million. And we anticipate about $100 million in the third quarter and $700 million for the year. 
So just as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher distribution in the second and fourth quarters as you're thinking about the run rates on that. And that -- those APLNG distributions are pretty locked in for the year because of long-term LNG sales, LNG are price lagged and so there's very little sensitivity to that for the remainder of the year.  
And so as you're thinking about how to look at run rates for the rest of the year, I direct you to our sensitivities that we provide, those still hold. And a good rule of thumb is about $300 million annualized cash flow for every $1 million change in WTI. And with those, you ought to be pretty bang on with CFO sensitivities."

I think if you're a pure-play 1-basin kind of operator, you're probably going to experience certain categories of spend that are inflating. I think the advantage that ConocoPhillips has right now is we're still capturing a lot of the best practices and the synergies from the Concho transaction plus the fact that we're a global diversified company. So other areas around the world are not inflating maybe like some of the economies that are leading the recovery from the COVID pandemic.  
So I think we're able to differentiate ourselves in that regard pretty clearly. We think it's imminently manageable this year and as we go into next year. And I would add 1 other thing that seems to be missing a little bit from the conversation, and I mentioned it in my opening remarks, and that's the unhedged nature of our portfolio. I'm just surprised to hear the analysts aren't asking the question to the E&Ps that are hedged, what happened. You could -- there could even be more cash flow if you hadn't hedged your position. You shouldn't expect that from ConocoPhillips. We'll get the torque from the upside on the prices as we described in my opening comments.

I mean, we -- of course, we are seeing some inflation in tubulars, cement in the Lower 48, some pressure on frac crews. But like Ryan said, being a global company really helps because we're still seeing deflation in certain categories internationally. So I think that's an interesting question.

Yes, as far as uses of cash, we've communicated before and broadly, we like to carry some of the cash on the balance sheet for strategic and reserve and operating purposes, and we've described that in quite a lot of detail in the past. I think with the commodity price environment that we're seeing today, the balance sheet's in great shape, as Bill described earlier on the last question. So I think as we get incremental free cash flow above and beyond our means, we're not necessarily looking to continue to build a lot of cash on the balance sheet. 
Shareholders should expect that they start getting incremental returns, if the -- if our view of the commodity prices continues to hold. We've seen how volatile that can be and the fact that the market is still pretty imbalanced. Demand is yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and you got arguably 5 million or more barrels a day of spare supply sitting in the market. So we still expect quite a lot of volatility, which is why we like the strength of the balance sheet that we have today and holding some cash on that balance sheet.

I can let Bill talk about the way we view deferred taxes over the course of the plan that you're referring to. And I guess in general, to your second one, on the private side, they are representing about 45-or-so percent of the rigs that are running in the tight oil plays in the Lower 48 today. But they only account for about 22% of the current production of about roughly 7 million barrels a day, probably increases the bid because they are pretty active, to your point. 
I think generally, as we think about it going forward, they run out of some of their best acreage over the next couple of years. So we don't see them having an outsized impact on the growth coming from the tight oil and being a dominant driver to U.S. production growth. That's really going to depend on the strong public companies like ConocoPhillips that have the best rocks and the higher-quality rock versus the private companies. So I think that's really the area to continue to focus on. Although we see, as well as you do, in the short term, some of the incremental production that's coming out of the private operators. 
We're certainly taking advantage of the commodity price environment that don't have maybe the investor pressure on discipline and returns of capital back to their shareholders while they're trying to increase the value of their properties as they go forward. So while a short-term thing, we don't think it will be a long-term driver to what the U.S. tight oil play looks like. So let me ask Bill to chime in on the deferred tax question."

So we continue to see that as an opportunity and have a longer-term goal to continue to grow that capacity and to be able to access some of those unique opportunities in the export market. And in fact, not even going to traders, they pick it up at the short line but going direct customer to customer, given some of our relations primarily in Asia and in southern South America as well. So that's an opportunity for us as well. 
On your second question, we announced our gross debt reduction plan, and that's consistent and equally important to the share repurchases that we're doing today. Once we obviously get through that debt optimization plan that we're doing, then returns of capital back to the shareholder would dominate. But right now, it's -- we are in a dual track of looking at, as Bill described, retiring some of our near-term debt maturities and then doing some optimization of our debt in the balance sheet as market conditions continue to provide the right opportunity to do that."

I think I go back to our original sideboards of the fairway that we've described to the -- to our shareholders to our owners is that you should expect greater than 30% of our cash returning back to our shareholders. That's on a quarterly and an annual basis. And if you look back at our history in the last 5 years, that's averaged over 40%. 
So I think -- and that's really the differentiation between our model for return of capital back to shareholders and maybe some of the others that we've been reading about and that we've been hearing about because it's not free cash flow-based. It is CFO-based. So as CFO grows because commodity prices are up, the shareholders should expect to get more distribution. Now we've chosen the -- in our ordinary dividend, we've said we want to be competitive. We want to grow that competitively with the S&P. That's how we're measuring ourselves. That's how we're measuring our performance of return on capital, and that's how we're measuring our performance of return of capital with respect to the ordinary dividend. 
And then -- but we want that ordinary dividend to be resilient through the cycles. So we don't want to -- we want to be able to afford it at the low end of the cycle, which we demonstrated last year through the pandemic. And then we recognize, as we get additional torque that we described with higher prices, because our cash flow is going to grow and our returns to our shareholders should grow as well. You should expect that to come. And at a minimum, it's going to be 30%. So it's not a free cash flow-based model. We think about it as a CFO-based model. 
And as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to watch what the best distribution channel, maybe it's a combination, maybe it's a hybrid down the road. We'll continue to watch that. But today, we feel like our shares are a great buy in the market. So the channel that we've chosen right now at this 10 seconds is to the strong ordinary dividend. It's yielding what it is today, combined with returning -- meeting our threshold of greater than 30% through the share buyback channel."

But I pivot back to what's important is the shareholders are going to get 30% of our cash flow or more on an ongoing basis. So you will get it.

As Ellen mentioned, I'll make a few opening comments, and then Bill will address a few details about this quarter's results and then we'll begin the Q&A session. 
In this morning's release, I referred to the quarter's results as notable. Obviously, financial and operating results were outstanding, but the context for describing them as notable meant something different. For the past year, we've been integrating Concho, improving underlying metrics across the business and creating the most competitive E&P for the energy transition. 
The significance of this quarter's performance is that it represents the post-Concho go-forward baseline for the company. On a run rate basis, the integration is essentially complete. We've captured the announced $1 billion of synergies and savings from actions the company took in connection with the transaction, all ahead of schedule. We're unhedged, but even more importantly, our torque to upside is helped by having high conversion of revenue to income and cash flow. The core executables of our global operating plan are delivering as expected. 
We'll close out 2021 as a stronger company compared to any time in the past decade. Every aspect of our triple mandate is moving in the right direction. Our underlying portfolio cost to supply is improving, our overall GHG intensity is lower, our emissions intensity reduction targets are more stringent, underlying margins are expanding and our trading 12-month return on capital employed is headed toward an estimated 14% by year end, reflecting the benefit of more than just stronger commodity prices. 
Between now and year end, our top priority is closing the Shell transaction, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. Once we close, we will be working diligently to integrate these properties and capture efficiencies in a similar fashion to what we've achieved through the Concho integration. In addition to layering in these properties on top of our existing high-performing platform, we're continuing to high-grade our portfolio and optimize the business drivers everywhere. 
This setup for next year is, well, notable. We're now in the process of setting our 2022 capital plans, which we expect to announce in early December. Directionally, we don't anticipate a significant departure on CapEx from what we included in our June update, excluding Shell. In June, we provided an outlook based on a roughly $50 per barrel price that included a modest ramp in the Lower 48 to reactivate our optimized plateau plans, some incremental [indiscernible] investment and some longer-cycle low cost of supply investments in Canada, the Montney and in Norway. 
Since June, we see some inflation pressures, especially in the Lower 48. However, at this point, we'd expect to adjust scope modestly in order to -- in response to maintain our base capital at a level that is roughly consistent with our June update. And then, of course, we'll add CapEx for the shale properties once we've brought them into the portfolio. 
As we finalize our 2022 plans, we're watching the macro closely, keeping an eye on inflation and potential OBO pressures and undertaking our typical capital high-grading processes. It goes without saying the market certainly appears to be more constructive, but we must always remember that this is an incredibly volatile business. But there's more to come on that in December. 
It's certainly been a busy year for the company but an incredibly successful 1 so far, and that's thanks to our dedicated and talented ConocoPhillips workforce. We believe we're entering a very constructive time for the sector. But even so, we know that there will be relative winners. The relative winners will be companies with the lowest cost of supply investment options, peer-leading delivery of returns on and of capital and visible progress on lowering emissions intensity. That's what we offer. Our third quarter represents a glimpse and a strong jumping-off point to what you can expect from ConocoPhillips going forward. So now let me turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the key items from this quarter."
296527,1682643212,2421539,"ConocoPhillips, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan.

To begin, adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share for the quarter. Relative to consensus, this performance reflects production volumes that were slightly above the midpoint of guidance, better-than-expected price realizations and lower-than-expected DD&A. As for the better realizations, we captured a higher percentage of Brent pricing in our overall realized prices. We've provided supplementary information in this morning's material to address the realizations variance. And as Ryan mentioned, we're unhedged so we're getting full exposure to the current higher prices. 
As for DD&A, we're trending lower compared to the previous guidance as a result of positive reserve revisions due to higher prices. You saw in today's release that we lowered full year 2021 DD&A guidance from $7.4 billion to $7.1 billion. Excluding Libya, production for the quarter was 1,507,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents about 2% underlying growth. Lower 48 production averaged 790,000 barrels a day, including about 445,000 from the Permian, 217,000 from the Eagle Ford and 95,000 from the Bakken. 
At the end of the quarter, we had 15 operated drilling rigs and 7 frac crews working in the Lower 48. Across the rest of our operations, the business ran extremely well. In particular, our planned seasonal turnaround activity across several regions went safely and smoothly. 
You will have noticed that we provided production guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 in this morning's release. This reflects the impact of a decision we're making to convert Concho 2-stream contracted volumes to a 3-stream reporting basis as part of our ongoing efforts to create marketing optionality across the Lower 48. We expect to convert the majority of our contracts in the fourth quarter. Reported production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 barrels a day, and both revenue and operating costs will increase by roughly $70 million. In other words, this conversion is earnings-neutral. Besides DD&A and production, there were no other changes to 2021 guidance items. 
Now once we've closed the Shell acquisition and can see where the ongoing U.S. tax legislation conversation lands, we'll provide an updated earnings and cash flow sensitivities that consider such factors as projected 2022 price ranges and how those ranges might impact our cash tax-paying position in various jurisdictions around the globe. 
Coming back to third quarter results. Cash from operations was $4.1 billion, which was reduced by about $200 million for nonrecurring items, so a bit higher than the average of external estimates on an underlying basis. Free cash flow was almost $3 billion this quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, this is about $6.5 billion. Through the first 9 months of the year, we returned $4 billion to shareholders and we're on track to meet our target of returning nearly $6 billion by the end of 2021. This is through a combination of our ordinary dividend and buybacks. 
So to summarize, as Ryan said, it was a notable quarter. The company is running exceptionally well, and we've achieved a significant reset of the base business post Concho. That creates a powerful platform for entering next year. We're focused on closing the Shell Permian acquisition so that we can begin the work of getting those properties fully integrated into the business, setting our capital plans for 2022, maintaining a leading position of returns on and of capital and lowering our emissions intensity. That's the triple mandate, that's what ConocoPhillips is all about, and we look forward to providing additional information in December. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of today's call."

Right now, the supply chain organization tells me that globally, we're thinking about mid-single-digit kind of inflation rates as we go into 2022. But it's bifurcated into 2 pieces, the U.S. being, depending where you're at geographically in the U.S., anywhere from kind of the low double digits to the higher single digits; the Permian being the  area probably the most influenced or the most experiencing inflation right now and as we go into 2022. 
And then the rest of the world, though, still at about 2% to 3% inflation rates kind of globally. So the categories that you can imagine are inflating right now certainly are those that are in need here in the U.S. as we start to recover out of the low point, things like OTCG, labor, sand, pressure pumping and the likes. I think as we think about it going forward, it's an opportunity for us to try to offset as much of that through some modest scope reduction and efficiencies, which I think is where Tim is focused in the Lower 48. I can ask, Tim, if you want to add anything to that relative to the Lower 48 in the Permian."

We'll do that through additional NEPA analysis. We're currently engaged with the BLM and the cooperating agencies up there, just working through those 3 particular issues. 
As you look forward, as we've mentioned, we continue to work through our detailed engineering in service of continued refinement of our cost and schedule and any development modifications, all in service of doing an FID. If you look at 2022, our capital program, that will reflect the continued engineering work. And then from a shareholder standpoint, we still see significant support from the Alaska delegation, the State of Alaska as well as the North Slope Borough. So we remain committed on this front. 
As far as other projects, we spoke about in the June 30 market update, in part, as an example, we've got Nuna, we've got Coyote. These will leverage existing infrastructure, so existing pads, facilities and pipelines, very low cost of supply opportunities that we're progressing.

We are continuing in dialogue with shareholders. This is an ongoing process on this very important matter. I think to share some key elements of that dialogue, as an E&P company, we continue to believe our Paris-aligned climate risk framework that we launched about a year ago is both credible and ambitious and addresses the realities of our triple mandate that you often hear us talking about. So that's responsibly meet transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns and achieve net zero emissions on the emissions we control, and that's Scope 1 and Scope 2. 
And we have established, just earlier this year, a dedicated low-carbon technology group, and they are supporting our business units and their ongoing progress to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 targets and our net zero ambition. But we are not ignoring Scope 3 end-use emissions. So our new low-carbon group are also working to develop new opportunities in low-carbon businesses with a focus on carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, both of which have a strong adjacency to our core business and our competencies. But those opportunities must, of course, deliver competitive returns for shareholders. 
And on the policy side, we continue to advocate for a well-designed economy-wide price on carbon, and we see that as the most viable solution for addressing demand and actually reducing Scope 3 end-use emissions. But we don't believe a Scope 3 target for a Paris-aligned E&P company like ConocoPhillips makes sense as it wouldn't address consumer demand, and it would shift supply away from top-tier ESG producers to less accountable producers and jurisdictions. 
And we believe, in fact, that a Paris-aligned E&P company with a focus on low GHG intensity and low cost of supply of production has a valuable and crucial role actually to play in the energy transition. So now of course, we take our stakeholder -- our shareholders' views very seriously, and we're continuing our engagement to understand their perspectives. It's an ongoing process. We'll continue that through the next couple of months here. But that perhaps gives you a flavor of the nature of the dialogue."

Underinvestment might be kicking in here. Do you see multiple years ahead of a potential recovery? 
And to the extent we actually are at the beginning of the structural up cycle, the last time we had one, the industry destroyed a lot of value over the long term by not seizing the opportunity appropriately. And so as a leader of the E&P industry, what is the message you're telling your folks about how you do it differently this time to create structural value to the extent you have a period of excess cash flow?"

And for all the reasons you stated, this becomes a -- turns into a supply problem. And I think that's going to be some pretty constructive tailwinds for the industry. So yes, you asked a bit of a provocative question there. 
So what would I say? Maybe a few things. For my peers, I would say we've got to restore sector sponsorship. And that's only going to happen through consistent returns on capital employed and they have to be competitive with the market. I think that's the opposite of what we saw in this boom bust industry. So I think investors need to have us on a short lease and -- short leash, and I think that would be good for this sector. So that's kind of what I would tell my peers. 
What would I tell investors? It is different right now because I think shale industry is being run as a free cash flow business. And so now we have short-cycle inventory that can be managed for returns of and returns on capital. But I think you have to remember 1 thing in that shale business that inventory quality really does matter. Because the ones with the best inventory like ConocoPhillips, we're going to be able to make market-competitive returns. And we can do that without having blowing through the roof on growth. 
So with modest growth, you can deliver those kinds of market-competitive returns for people that have the top quality shale inventory. And I think that's a pretty big paradigm shift, so that discipline on growth and returns on and of capital really, really matters. 
Lastly, and this would be for investors and my peers, for everyone really, is the energy transition is happening. We are going through a transition today, but I think that's a new lens that we have to look at this business through and it requires a bit of new thinking. And I think Dominic just referred to that in the last question that Jeanine had, which is our triple mandate. We must do those 3 things simultaneously, and we've got to do them really, really well. So we have to meet the transition demand. Whatever slope that demand going on, we've got to be there to supply it with low cost of supplies barrels because we've got to deliver on our returns and we've got to meet our net zero ambition ultimately by 2050 in this business. So I guess that would be the few things that I would offer, Neil, and really shame on us if this industry can do it and I can guarantee you, ConocoPhillips will."

We have accelerated our sales. We expect to exit our position sometime early part of next year and we're executing those sales in a thoughtful and measured way. We continue to monitor market conditions as we move forward. Assuming that they remain supportive, we'll be out early part of next year. 
You also asked about the contingent payments from Cenovus. During the quarter, we recognized about $100 million in pretax earnings, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million so far in Cenovus contingent payments. And at current pricing, we'd expect to recognize another $100 million in the fourth quarter. Now the contingent term expires at the end of the second quarter 2022. But at current strip prices, we'd expect to continue to accrue contingent payments in the first and second quarter of next year. 
It's probably also worth mentioning that we are still continuing to receive contingent payments also from our San Juan sale. This would throw that in there a bit.

I think what I tried to be pretty clear about is our 30% of CFO is going back to the shareholders. So that's a commitment you can take to the bank as an investor in ConocoPhillips. 
And with this run-up in the prices that we've seen here lately, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming from our operations as a result. You asked, ""What about the channel?"" I'd say maybe before the channel conversation, too, with the Shell acquisition will probably look to try to put some more money onto the balance sheet as we go through the course of this. 
But more directly to your question about the channel, I've been comfortable based on our outlook and our view of the macro, where things are going right now, to split the distribution between the ordinary dividend and share repurchase. So how do I think about the ordinary dividend? For me, it needs to be something that's incredibly reliable, it's transparent, it's global, it's reliable. You can count on it, you can take it to the bank. And it works at the downside of this sector in the -- whenever we go through those downturns. That's how I think about the dividend. 
And I think you can get your fork when these times are pretty good, but I think you got to think about the dividend being commitment, reliable, always there and it's growable. And so that's how I think about the dividend. But more importantly, you should expect to get a 30% of our cash coming back from our operations. That's our commitment. That's what we've done for a number of years, and that's what we're going to continue to go do. 
So as that CFO goes up, you're going to get those dollars. And we've been pretty open to the channel. We've had this conversation with the market and with our investors. And as we see circumstances changing, we're not locked into a specific channel to go do that.

I think -- yes, I think you should think about it on top, again, the market update plan was at a $50 a barrel price deck. So our commitment to our investors is that 30% of the cash will go back to the shareholders as price increase and our cash flows increase, you should expect the distribution to the shareholders to increase. 
We're still going to maintain a very strong balance sheet and having some cash on the balance sheet is important to the company. And then we'll deliver modest growth. That's always been kind of an output out of our plans. We want to make sure that we have a good idea of where the macro is going to go for the next year. We're going to set our capital budget plans to deliver the strongest returns on that capital that we can manage. 
We don't want to blow into the face of really high super inflation. We've seen what that's done before to return. So we'll be very conscious of that as we go into what we think is a pretty constructive view of the macro going for the next 2 to 3 years. So you ought to expect us to act like we've done in the past, we'll be really judicious how we spend our capital, make sure we're getting the most out of every capital dollar we can, shareholders are going to get 30% of their cash back They'll get that through the dividend and through some share buyback, maybe another channel. We'll see if that's the right thing to do for the company with where we're at, and we're going to maintain a very strong balance sheet as we go through this process. 
But adding the Shell just made the company better made it, more resilient and made more cash flow and more -- so that means there'll be more returns of capital back to the shareholder. And then remember, we're running the Shell assets just like we're running our own Lower 48 asset -- our Lower 48 asset at about a 50% to 60% reinvestment rate. We're -- again, that's what I tried to say at the beginning, we're executing the shell differently than what this industry did a number of years ago."

Ryan, you talked about the inflationary pressure you're seeing in the Lower 48 with that kind of high single-digit to low double-digit inflation versus the international part of your portfolio, which is still rather modest at kind of 2% to 3% inflation. 
Obviously, Tim and his team have done a great job on the efficiency gain side on the Lower 48. But it doesn't sound like, at least for the 2022 plan, that we should anticipate any material shift in sort of that, I guess, international versus Lower 48 sort of mix. But just I realize this is oversimplifying it, but like how wide would that spread have to be from a service concentration perspective, Lower 48 versus international, where we might see you all lean a little bit more on the international portfolio?"

So I think we just want to be clear about how we kind of see it developing in the significant categories of spend that we have in the company and try to give you an idea of what we're seeing today. We'll continue to watch it. 
I think it probably more goes to our Lower 48 business. If we see hyperinflation and start seeing it running away from us, we might adjust our scope modestly, so we're not going to try to go into that. So again, it's with a really focus on making sure the returns are adequate for the capital that we're investing. And I think Tim said in one of his responses, we're a large company. We've got a very sophisticated supply chain organization, very sophisticated commercial organization and the efficiencies that we're bringing out of the business are still there. 
So we think we have a way to mitigate quite a lot of it. And we'll just adjust our plans if we get out of control as an example. So that's where we stand out as an E&P company. We're global.

As Ellen mentioned, I'll make a few opening comments, and then Bill will address a few details about this quarter's results. And then we'll begin the Q&A session.  
In this morning's release, I referred to the quarter's results as notable. Obviously, financial and operating results were outstanding, but the context for describing them as notable meant something different. For the past year, we've been integrating Concho, improving underlying metrics across the business and creating the most competitive E&P for the energy transition. The significance of this quarter's performance is that it represents the post-Concho go-forward baseline for the company. 
On a run rate basis, the integration is essentially complete. We've captured the announced $1 billion of synergies and savings from actions the company took in connection with the transaction, all ahead of schedule. We're unhedged, but even more importantly, our torque to upside is helped by having high conversion of revenue to income and cash flow. The core executables of our global operating plan are delivering as expected.  
We'll close out 2021 as a stronger company compared to any time in the past decade. Every aspect of our triple mandate is moving in the right direction. Our underlying portfolio cost to supply is improving. Our overall GHG intensity is lower. Our emissions intensity reduction targets are more stringent. Underlying margins are expanding, and our trailing 12-month return on capital employed is headed toward an estimated 14% by year-end, reflecting the benefit of more than just stronger commodity prices.  
Between now and year-end, our top priority is closing the Shell transaction, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. Once we close, we will be working diligently to integrate these properties and capture efficiencies in a similar fashion to what we've achieved through the Concho integration. In addition to layering in these properties on top of our existing high-performing platform, we're continuing to high-grade our portfolio and optimize the business drivers everywhere. The setup for next year is, well, notable. 
We're now in the process of setting our 2022 capital plans, which we expect to announce in early December. Directionally, we don't anticipate a significant departure on CapEx from what we included in our June update excluding Shell. In June, we provided an outlook based on a roughly $50 per barrel price that included a modest ramp in the Lower 48 to reactivate our optimized plateau plans, some incremental base Alaska investment and some longer-cycle low cost of supply investments in Canada, the Montney and in Norway.  
Since June, we see some inflation pressures, especially in the Lower 48. However, at this point, we'd expect to adjust scope modestly in order -- in response to maintain our base capital at a level that is roughly consistent with our June update. And then, of course, we'll add CapEx for the Shell properties once we've brought them into the portfolio.  
As we finalize our 2022 plans, we're watching the macro closely, keeping an eye on inflation and potential OBO pressures and undertaking our typical capital high-grading processes. It goes without saying the market certainly appears to be more constructive, but we must always remember that this is an incredibly volatile business. But there's more to come on that in December.  
It's certainly been a busy year for the company but an incredibly successful one so far, and that's thanks to our dedicated and talented ConocoPhillips workforce. We believe we're entering a very constructive time for the sector, but even so, we know that there will be relative winners. The relative winners will be companies with the lowest cost of supply investment options, peer-leading delivery of returns on and of capital and visible progress on lowering emissions intensity. That's what we offer. Our third quarter represents a glimpse and a strong jumping-off point to what you can expect from ConocoPhillips going forward. 
So now let me turn it over to Bill, who will cover some of the key items from this quarter."
296527,1682643212,2421602,"ConocoPhillips, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","ConocoPhillips","Executives","Thanks, Ryan. To begin, adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share for the quarter. Relative to consensus, this performance reflects production volumes that were slightly above the midpoint of guidance, better-than-expected price realizations and lower-than-e",598,"Thanks, Ryan. To begin, adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share for the quarter. Relative to consensus, this performance reflects production volumes that were slightly above the midpoint of guidance, better-than-expected price realizations and lower-than-expected DD&A. 
As for the better realizations, we captured a higher percentage of Brent pricing in our overall realized prices. We've provided supplementary information in this morning's material to address the realizations variance. And as Ryan mentioned, we're unhedged so we're getting full exposure to the current higher prices. As for DD&A, we're trending lower compared to the previous guidance as a result of positive reserve revisions due to higher prices. You saw in today's release that we lowered full year 2021 DD&A guidance from $7.4 billion to $7.1 billion. 
Excluding Libya, production for the quarter was 1,507,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents about 2% underlying growth. Lower 48 production averaged 790,000 barrels a day, including about 445,000 from the Permian, 217,000 from the Eagle Ford and 95,000 from the Bakken. At the end of the quarter, we had 15 operated drilling rigs and 7 frac crews working in the Lower 48. Across the rest of our operations, the business ran extremely well. In particular, our planned seasonal turnaround activity across several regions went safely and smoothly. 
You will have noticed that we provided production guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 in this morning's release. This reflects the impact of a decision we're making to convert Concho 2-stream contracted volumes to a 3-stream reporting basis as part of our ongoing efforts to create marketing optionality across the Lower 48. We expect to convert the majority of our contracts in the fourth quarter. Reported production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 barrels a day, and both revenue and operating costs will increase by roughly $70 million. In other words, this conversion is earnings neutral. 
Besides DD&A and production, there were no other changes to 2021 guidance items. Now once we've closed the Shell acquisition and can see where the ongoing U.S. tax legislation conversation lands, we'll provide an updated earnings and cash flow sensitivities that consider such factors as projected 2022 price ranges and how those ranges might impact our cash taxpaying position in various jurisdictions around the globe.  
Coming back to third quarter results. Cash from operations was $4.1 billion, which was reduced by about $200 million for nonrecurring items, so a bit higher than the average of external estimates on an underlying basis. Free cash flow was almost $3 billion this quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, this is about $6.5 billion. 
Through the first 9 months of the year, we've returned $4 billion to shareholders, and we're on track to meet our target of returning nearly $6 billion by the end of 2021. This is through a combination of our ordinary dividend and buybacks.  
So to summarize, as Ryan said, it was a notable quarter. The company is running exceptionally well, and we've achieved a significant reset of the base business post Concho. That creates a powerful platform for entering next year. 
We're focused on closing the Shell Permian acquisition so that we can begin the work of getting those properties fully integrated into the business, setting our capital plans for 2022, maintaining a leading position of returns on and of capital and lowering our emissions intensity. That's the triple mandate. That's what ConocoPhillips is all about. And we look forward to providing additional information in December. 
I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of today's call."

As we're kind of in the middle of -- like I said in our opening comments, in the middle of putting all our plans together. Right now, the supply chain organization tells me that globally, we're thinking about mid-single-digit kind of inflation rates as we go into 2022. But it's bifurcated into 2 pieces: the U.S. being, depending where you're at geographically in the U.S., anywhere from kind of the low double digits to the higher single digits, the Permian being the area probably that's most influenced or most experiencing inflation right now and as we go into 2022; and then the rest of the world though still at about 2% to 3% inflation rates kind of globally. So the categories that you can imagine are inflating right now certainly are those that are in need here in the U.S. as we start to recover out of the low point, things like OTCG (sic) [ OCTG ], labor, sand, pressure pumping and the likes. 
I think as we think about it going forward, it's an opportunity for us to try to offset as much of that through some modest scope reduction and efficiencies, which I think is where Tim is focused in the Lower 48. I can ask -- Tim, if you want to add anything to that relative to the Lower 48, in the Permian."

As you've probably seen in the press, both the Department of Justice and ourselves decided not to appeal the Alaska District Court decision.

We'll do that through additional NEPA analysis. We're currently engaged with the BLM and the cooperating agencies up there, just working through those 3 particular issues.  
As you look forward, as we've mentioned, we continue to work through our detailed engineering in service of continued refinement of our cost and schedule and any development modifications, all in service of doing an FID. If you look at 2022, our capital program, that will reflect the continued engineering work. And then from a shareholder standpoint, we still see significant support from the Alaska delegation, the State of Alaska as well as the North Slope Borough. So we remain committed on this front.  
As far as other projects, we spoke about in the June 30 market update, in part, as an example, we've got Nuna, we've got Coyote. These will leverage existing infrastructure, so existing pads, facilities and pipelines, very low cost of supply opportunities that we're progressing. And then on the Prudhoe front, we're seeing great efficiency improvements and safety performance. They continue to reduce costs across the board. So our teams are heavily engaged. So all 3 legacy assets are performing well."

We are continuing in dialogue with shareholders. This is an ongoing process on this very important matter. I think to share some key elements of that dialogue, as an E&P company, we continue to believe our Paris-aligned climate risk framework that we launched about a year ago is both credible and ambitious and addresses the realities of our triple mandate that you often hear us talking about. So that's responsibly meet transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns and achieve net zero emissions on the emissions we control, and that's Scope 1 and Scope 2.  
And we have established just earlier this year a dedicated low-carbon technology group, and they are supporting our business units in their ongoing progress to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 targets and our net zero ambition. But we are not ignoring Scope 3 end-use emissions. So our new low-carbon group are also working to develop new opportunities in low-carbon businesses with a focus on carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, both of which have a strong adjacency to our core business and our competencies. But those opportunities must, of course, deliver competitive returns for shareholders.  
And on the policy side, we continue to advocate for a well-designed economy-wide price on carbon, and we see that as the most viable solution for addressing demand and actually reducing Scope 3 end-use emissions. But we don't believe a Scope 3 target for a Paris-aligned E&P company like ConocoPhillips makes sense as it wouldn't address consumer demand and it would shift supply away from top-tier ESG producers to less accountable producers and jurisdictions.  
And we believe, in fact, that a Paris-aligned E&P company with a focus on low GHG intensity and low cost of supply of production has a valuable and crucial role actually to play in the energy transition. So now of course, we take our stakeholder -- our shareholders' views very seriously, and we're continuing our engagement to understand their perspectives. It's an ongoing process. We'll continue that through the next couple of months here. But that perhaps gives you a flavor of the nature of the dialogue."

As you noted and as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher distributions in the second and fourth quarters. And as you think about APLNG, due to the pricing lag with APLNG's long-term LNG sales, there's really little sensitivity to price for the remainder of 2021 distributions as LNG pricing is essentially set.

But the big-picture question is, Ryan, do you think we're at the beginning of a structural up cycle here, which is we've been through 7 years of a very dark period of oversupply in the industry? Underinvestment might be kicking in here. Do you see multiple years ahead of a potential recovery?  
And to the extent we actually are at the beginning of a structural up cycle, the last time we had one, the industry destroyed a lot of value over the long term by not seizing the opportunity appropriately. And so as a leader of the E&P industry, what is the message you're telling your folks about how you do it differently this time to create structural value to the extent you have a period of excess cash flow?"

And for all the reasons you stated, this becomes a -- turns into a supply problem. And I think that's going to be some pretty constructive tailwinds for the industry. 
So yes, you asked a bit of a provocative question there. So what would I say? Maybe a few things. For my peers, I would say we've got to restore sector sponsorship. And that's only going to happen through consistent returns on capital employed, and they have to be competitive with the market. I think that's the opposite of what we saw in this boom/bust industry. So I think investors need to have us on a short lease and -- short leash, and I think that would be good for this sector. So that's kind of what I would tell my peers.  
What would I tell investors? It is different right now because I think shale industry is being run as a free cash flow business. And so now we have short-cycle inventory that can be managed for returns of and returns on capital. But I think you have to remember one thing in that shale business, that inventory quality really does matter. 
Because the ones with the best inventory like ConocoPhillips, we're going to be able to make market-competitive returns, and we can do that without having -- blowing through the roof on growth. So with modest growth, you can deliver those kinds of market-competitive returns for people that have the top-quality shale inventory. And I think that's a pretty big paradigm shift. So that discipline on growth and returns on and of capital really, really matters.  
Lastly, and this would be for investors and my peers, for everyone really, is the energy transition is happening. We are going through a transition today, but I think that's a new lens that we have to look at this business through, and it requires a bit of new thinking. And I think Dominic just referred to that in the last question that Jeanine had, which is our triple mandate. We must do those 3 things simultaneously, and we've got to do them really, really well. 
So we have to meet the transition demand. Whatever slope that demand going on, we've got to be there to supply it with low cost of supplies barrels because we've got to deliver on our returns. And we've got to meet our net zero ambition ultimately by 2050 in this business. So I guess that would be the few things that I would offer, Neil. And really, shame on us if this industry can't do it, and I can guarantee you ConocoPhillips will."

And there are so many different ways that we can create value, from the way the wells are drilled, the way the wells are completed, the marketing arrangements. And it also gives us the opportunity with those additional assets coming in. We have way more flexibility on what we can dispose of and how we can high-grade our portfolio.  
So it's -- it gives us the opportunity to do what I think we're really good at from an operation standpoint but also from property management. And the swaps and trades, we have a dedicated group around that, and they can create a lot of value in the basin. All the operators are trying to get out of each other's way and not have so much outside operated and create longer lateral drilling opportunities, all kind of things like that."

We've sold about 67 million shares year-to-date. That's about 30% of our original balance. And so we reduced our equity stake in Cenovus from about 10% to about 7%. And those proceeds have been used to buy back about $600 million of Conoco bulk shares through the third quarter. And you'll note on our slides for cash that, that was about $400 million for the third quarter.  
We have accelerated our sales. We expect to exit our position sometime early part of next year, and we're executing those sales in a thoughtful and measured way. We continue to monitor market conditions as we move forward. Assuming that they remain supportive, we'll be out early part of next year.  
You also asked about the contingent payments from Cenovus. During the quarter, we recognized about $100 million in pretax earnings, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million so far in Cenovus contingent payments. And at current pricing, we'd expect to recognize another $100 million in the fourth quarter. Now the contingent term expires at the end of the second quarter 2022. But at current strip prices, we'd expect to continue to accrue contingent payments in the first and second quarter of next year.  
It's probably also worth mentioning that we are still continuing to receive contingent payments also from our San Juan sale. Just would throw that in there a bit. We've accumulated so far $30 million in pretax this year with $21 million in the third quarter and expect to accrue another $21 million on that in the fourth quarter. And at current prices, that should continue through calendar year next year."

I think what I tried to be pretty clear about is our 30% of CFO is going back to the shareholders. So that's a commitment you can take to the bank as an investor in ConocoPhillips. And with this run-up in the prices that we've seen here lately, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming from our operations as a result. 
You asked, ""What about the channel?"" I'd say maybe before the channel conversation, too, the Shell acquisition will probably look to try to put some more money onto the balance sheet as we go through the course of this. But more directly to your question about the channel, I've been comfortable, based on our outlook and our view of the macro, where things are going right now, to split the distribution between the ordinary dividend and share repurchase. 
So how do I think about the ordinary dividend? For me, it needs to be something that's incredibly reliable. It's transparent. It's global. It's reliable. You can count on it. You can take it to the bank. And it works at the downside of this sector in the -- whenever we go through those downturns. That's how I think about the dividend. 
And I think you can get your fork when these times are pretty good, but I think you got to think about the dividend being commitment, reliable, always there and it's growable. And so that's how I think about the dividend. But more importantly, you should expect to get  30% of our cash coming back from our operations. That's our commitment. That's what we've done for a number of years, and that's what we're going to continue to go do. So as that CFO goes up, you're going to get those dollars. 
And we've been pretty open to the channel. We've had this conversation with the market and with our investors. And as we see circumstances changing, we're not locked into a specific channel to go do that. But -- so I take your point, Doug. I think -- I probably think about the ordinary dividend just a little bit differently."

We upped that to $4 billion to $5 billion as a result of the Shell transaction just because, when we get the first look at the portfolio, primarily in the Permian, we think there's going to be some cleanup that we can do with Tim's team and the trading and the swapping that he described earlier and some outright sales.

So you ought to expect us to act like we've done in the past. We'll be really judicious how we spend our capital, make sure we're getting the most out of every capital dollar we can. Shareholders are going to get 30% of their cash back. They'll get that through the dividend and through some share buyback, maybe another channel. We'll see if that's the right thing to do for the company with where we're at, and we're going to maintain a very strong balance sheet as we go through this process. 
But adding the Shell just made the company better, made it more resilient and made more cash flow and more -- so that means there'll be more returns of capital back to the shareholder. And then remember we're running the Shell assets just like we're running our own Lower 40 asset -- or Lower 48 assets at about a 50% to 60% reinvestment rate. We're -- again, that's what I tried to say at the beginning. We're executing the Shell differently than what this industry did a number of years ago."

Ryan, you talked about the inflationary pressure you're seeing in the Lower 48 with that kind of high single-digit to low double-digit inflation versus the international part of your portfolio, which is still rat",141,"Okay. And then just my follow-up question. Ryan, you talked about the inflationary pressure you're seeing in the Lower 48 with that kind of high single-digit to low double-digit inflation versus the international part of your portfolio, which is still rather modest at kind of 2% to 3% inflation. Obviously, Tim and his team have done a great job on the efficiency gain side on the Lower 48. 
But it doesn't sound like, at least for the 2022 plan, that we should anticipate any material shift in sort of that, I guess, international versus Lower 48 sort of mix. But just -- I realize this is oversimplifying it. But like how wide would that spread have to be from a service concentration perspective, Lower 48 versus international, where we might see you lean a little bit more on the international portfolio?"

I don't think we'll probably allocate capital based on how we see those different inflation rates going.

I don't think we'll probably allocate capital based on how we see those different inflation rates going. So I think we just want to be clear about how we kind of see it developing in the significant categories of spend that we have in the company and try to give you an idea of what we're seeing today. We'll continue to watch it. 
I think it probably more goes to our Lower 48 business. If we see hyperinflation and start seeing it running away from us, we might adjust our scope modestly. So we're not going to try to go into that. So again, it's with a, really, focus on making sure the returns are adequate for the capital that we're investing. And I think Tim said in one of his responses we're a large company. We've got a very sophisticated supply chain organization, very sophisticated commercial organization, and the efficiencies that we're bringing out of the business are still there. So we think we have a way to mitigate quite a lot of it, and we'll just adjust our plans if it gets out of control as an example. 
So that's where we stand out as an E&P company. We're global. We're big. And that's a huge advantage to us when we think about the impacts of these kinds of things on our business."
