I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. 
Before jumping into our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to again thank our employees and the families and communities that support them as well as our partners and customers for their continued commitment during uncertain times. That commitment, combined with our resilient subscription business model and the secular shift to the cloud, enabled us to maintain momentum and exceed our goals. 
We generated strong growth with full year subscription revenue and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, up 26% and 19%, respectively. We also made significant progress towards digitizing AEC, converging design and make in manufacturing and converting noncompliant and legacy users. We signed a record number of new enterprise business agreements, or EBAs, in the fourth quarter. In fact, were equal to the number we signed in the entirety of the previous year. That's a testament both to our execution and growing partnership with our enterprise customers as we enable their digital transformations, demonstrated by enterprise BIM 360 usage nearly doubling year-over-year. 
While we made great strides this year, we intend to extend our leadership in the cloud and expand our presence in existing and adjacent industry verticals across the globe. The pending acquisition of Innovyze, which we announced yesterday and is expected to close later this quarter, is a great example of that intent. Innovyze is a global leader in water infrastructure simulation and modeling, serving many of the world's largest utilities, the majority of the top E&R design firms and other leading environmental and engineering consultancies. 
Interbodies enables water distribution networks and drainage systems to be more cost effectively and sustainably designed and operated. Combined with Civil 3D, Infraworks, Revit and Autodesk Construction Cloud, we would be able to provide end-to-end water and wastewater solutions across planning, design, construction and operations. 
With our existing capabilities in road and rail and our partnership with Origo and Capital Planning, we now have end-to-end infrastructure solutions for facilities owners and public sector agencies. Autodesk provides Innovyze with multiple opportunities to scale through enterprise, channel sales and geographic expansion. We also intend to apply our expertise in navigating through a business model transition to drive additional growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond.  I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to the future with optimism. 
In the near term, we expect the unwinding of uncertainty from vaccine availability and political stability to drive confidence and investment over the second half of the year. Over the long term, Autodesk's purpose to drive efficiency and sustainability has never been more relevant or urgent. 
In partnership with our customers, we have an unmatched capacity to drive efficiency and meet the global challenges of carbon emissions, embedded carbon, water scarcity and waste. And Autodesk is playing its part. We are on track to meet our commitment to be climate neutral and remain dedicated to being a resilient, diverse and equitable company. We were most recently recognized by Barron's as #4 on their list of world's 100 most sustainable companies and the highest ranked software company. We are proud of our impacted Autodesk. And through our customers, the impact we are making in the wider world. 
I'm also thrilled to announce 2 strong additions to my team. Debbie Clifford will be returning to Autodesk's Chief Financial Officer; and Raji Arasu will be joining as Chief Technology Officer. Debbie is currently Chief Financial Officer at SurveyMonkey, but spent the 13 years prior to that role in various financial leadership roles at Autodesk, including leading the internal business model transition team, engaging with many of you in support of our investor outreach and as my finance business partner before I became CEO. With her leadership skills, expertise and passion for our mission, Autodesk finance team will not miss a beat. 
Raji joined us from Intuit, where she currently serves as Senior Vice President of their Platform and Services business. Prior to that, she was CTO for eBay subsidiary Stubhub. At Autodesk, you will oversee and be responsible to the Autodesk Technology and Platform Strategy as well as being operationally responsible for the ongoing development of our platform services. Raji will replace current Autodesk CTO, Scott Berdine, who announced the tent to retire last year after more than 21 years of service to the company. Scott had 2 tours of Autodesk CEO, the prior one working for Carol Bartz, and has not only contributed to the rise of adventure infusion to the products they are today, but also as a passionate evangelist for Autodesk and our vision. Emblematic of his dedication to Autodesk, he moved out his retirement date so that he can help Raji during her transition into Autodesk. I'd like to give Scott a heartfelt thank you for all he's done and is continuing to do. 
Before I provide insight into our strategic growth drivers, let me take you through the details of our quarterly and full year performance and the guidance for the next year. In an extraordinary year, we performed strongly across all metrics, perhaps best encapsulated by the sum of our revenue growth and free cash flow margin for the year equaling 51%. 
Several factors contributed to that strength in the fourth quarter, including record EBAs, robust subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales and continued sequential growth in new business. 
Total revenue growth in the quarter was 16%, both as reported and in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 22% and now representing approximately 91% of total revenue. There was approximately 2 percentage points of benefit to subscription and maintenance growth from upfront revenue recognition of some products that do not incorporate substantial cloud services. 
Looking at revenue by product and geography. AutoCAD and LT revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the year. AEC grew 18% in Q4 and 20% for the year. Manufacturing rose 17% in Q4 and 10% for the year. Even excluding the benefit from a strong performance in automotive EBAs which include nonratable VRED revenue, manufacturing grew double digits in the quarter. 
M&E grew 14% in the quarter, boosted by a strong performance from our collaboration platform Shotgun and was up 10% for the year. Geographically, revenue growth ticked up in all regions. Revenue grew 14% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 23% in APAC during the quarter. 
We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 28% versus last year and represented 34% of our total sales, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of last year. The strength in our direct business was driven by some nonratable products included in a few large EBAs and digital sales. 
During the year, we grew total subscriptions by 8% to $5.3 million. Excluding the multiuser trade-in program, total subscriptions grew 4% to $5.1 million. Subscription plan subscriptions grew 15% and by 10%, excluding the multi-user trade-in program. We added 130,000 made subscriptions due to the strong adoption of our BIM 360 family and Fusion 360 products. 
During Q4, our maintenance, conversion and renewal rates declined sequentially, which was expected as we are entering the final stages of our maintenance to subscription program. With only 1 quarter left before this program retires, we have approximately 126,000 maintenance subscriptions remaining, accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. I am proud to share that we have converted over 1.3 million maintenance subscriptions to date. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the lion's share of commercial subscriptions were named users benefiting from easier access, usage data visibility and secure license mandate. We anticipate many of our remaining multi-user subscribers will make the transition to named users as the pandemic recedes. And we are now extending our 2:1 multiuser trade in to August 2023 to enable that. 
As announced last November, we are also exploring consumption-based models to meet the needs of customers requiring flexible license usage. Our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100 to 110 percentage range we laid out in our guidance. Our product subscription renewal rates remain robust, reinforcing the business-critical nature of our products to our customers. 
Our billings were broadly level with last year, reflecting fewer multiyear sales, and our long-term deferred revenue was 26% of total deferred revenue in Q4. Our total RPO of $4.2 billion is up 19%, and our current RPO of $2.7 billion grew 16%. 
On margins, we continue to realize good operating leverage due to strong revenue growth and diligent expense management. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margins remained very strong at 93%, up 1 percentage point from last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 29%. 
As you have seen in our press release, our GAAP results include a $679 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance released in the fourth quarter. This largely reflects the completion of our business model transition and the significant growth in our profitability. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurpose shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 530,000 shares for $157 million at an average price of approximately $295 per share. For the full year, we purchased 2.6 million shares for $549 million, at an average price of approximately $208 per share. 
Now let me turn to our guidance, which does not include Innovyze. We expect an improving macroeconomic environment during the year will result in accelerating growth in new business over the course of fiscal 2022. Usage trends during the fourth quarter remained above pre-COVID levels in most of Asia Pacific and Continental Europe and below pre-COVID levels in the U.S. and U.K. 
We have seen an uptick in interest from multiyear deals growing optimism in the channel and gradual recovery in bid activity on BuildingConnected in the U.S. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be very healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. 
Given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. For fiscal 2022, we expect revenue to grow by 13% to 15%. Margins to expand to between 31% and 32%, and free cash flow growth to reaccelerate to approximately 20%. When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal 2022, we expect about 3/4 of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our macroeconomic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. 
As we noted last quarter, Vault revenue is becoming ratable for fiscal 2022, with the release of significant new mobile fee functionality in the first quarter. And this will reduce our revenue growth by about a percentage point over the year, with the biggest impact in our revenue on the P&L and in the manufacturing product family. 
Looking at our guidance for the first quarter. Normal seasonality is compounded by Vault ratability and one fewer calendar day versus Q1 fiscal 2021, which together reduce year-on-year revenue growth in the first quarter by about 2 percentage points. With improving macroeconomic conditions and easing comparables, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate after the first quarter. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the fiscal first quarter and full year 2022. 
We expect Innovyze to be accretive to revenue growth, broadly neutral to free cash flow and a headwind on reported operating margins in fiscal 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details after the Innovyze transaction completes. 
Let me finish by giving you some details on the progress we made executing on our strategy to digitize AEC, converge design and make in manufacturing and monetize noncompliant and legacy users. Early in February, we launched our Autodesk Construction Cloud platform, which unifies our organic and acquired AEC cloud offerings and the data held within them to enable a connected project ecosystem across design and construction. 
Underpinning the Autodesk Construction Cloud is our common data environment, Autodesk. This provides seamless navigation, integrated workflows and project controls and enables a single source of truth across the project life cycle. Autodesk build brings together the best of Plangrid and BIM 360 with new functionality, which along with Autodesk Quantify and BIM collaborate, creates a comprehensive suite of field construction and project management solutions. 
For our design customers, BIM Collaborate Pro extended the capabilities of BIM 360 design on the new platform to create a more seamless exchange of project data between design and construction. Our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. We have pursued that strategy to create Autodesk Construction Cloud. We are pursuing that strategy and infrastructure with the acquisition of Innovyze, and we will continue to pursue that strategy in manufacturing. 
The reasons for and the benefits of this strategy were clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Our growing partnership with our enterprise customers, as we enable their digital transformations, resulted both in record number of EBAs in the fourth quarter and also strong expansion in renewal rates with existing EBA customers. 
We are seeing our new products, typically used by contractors, being increasingly adopted by design firms. For example, we expanded our agreement with Jacobs, the world's largest design firm to include pipe, PlanGrid and assemble to enable greater collaboration and more efficient workflows. Autodesk has been a trusted partner of Jacobs over the last 30 years, aligned with its mission to challenge day to day and reinvent tomorrow. 
Jacobs is also using Autodesk's transformative services to help them deliver innovative solutions to their customers. For example, Autodesk and Jacob's partner to deliver the world's first generatively designed airport in Australia. And together, we are focused on leveraging generative design to solve their other client challenges around the world. 
Environmental air systems, EAS, a full-service mechanical contractor and custom-built HVAC equipment manufacturer, which is on the forefront of industrialized construction, increased its investment with Autodesk by replacing its existing project management tool with BIM 360. It is now able to leverage its existing investment in AEC collections and provide a comprehensive tool for its teams to collaborate and to connect the office and the field. 
, a leading sustainable urban development consultancy in Sweden, significantly expanded its strategic platform partnership with Autodesk. As Digital Strategy Manager for business area  has said ""is at the leading edge of the digital transformation of the construction and maintenance industry. Digitization enables smart buildings design that requires secure data flows and seamless collaboration across a broad ecosystem stakeholders during the construction and operations process. Autodesk's Revit and BIM 360 docs empowered us to create true digital representations. And now with Forge, we can leverage those assets as digital twins to create value for different stakeholders such as a reduction of energy consumption, the prediction and optimization of maintenance and new smart, seamless end user services."" 
We are also seeing benefits from our strategy in manufacturing. In the automotive sector, we provide design software through our enterprise business agreements to nearly all the largest automotive OEMs and are extending our footprint beyond design into the factory. For example, our expanded partnership with Rivian, a global provider of electric adventure vehicles, now extends across facilities with Revit, BIM 360 and PlanGrid. Manufacturing with Inventor and generative design and in the design studio with Alias, Vrad and Shotgun. We are able to support Rivian as it converts existing facilities to digital twins, optimizes its factory layout using generative design, improves energy efficiency through simulation and enables collaboration and efficiency using a common data environment. 
Similarly, we are providing end-to-end support to our long-term customer Transmash holding, TMH, which is the largest manufacturing of rolling stock and rail equipment in Russia and CIS, to accelerate its digital transformation and converge its design and make processes. TMH now builds trains and concept in, designs and engineers an Inventor, optimizes infusion, producers and power mill and sales in VRED. 
Our market-leading cloud-based platform, Fusion 360, enjoyed another quarter of accelerating subscriptions, growing scale of deployments and adding competitive displacement, ending the quarter with over 140,000 commercial subscriptions.  Prototyping, a machine shop based in Pittsburgh, recently expanded its relationship with Autodesk by adding more fusion seats.  is also adopting our recently launched machining extension due to its integrated design and CAM work flows, its advanced manufacturing capability and the potential of generative design to reduce project time lines and solve design for manufacturing issues faster than ever before. 
In education, we continue to expand our footprint and replace traditional CAD competitors. With Tinker CAT infusion alone, Autodesk is now approaching 40 million education users worldwide. For example, all of university college London's mechanical engineers switched to Fusion 360 during the fourth quarter. As Professor Tim Baker, MBE, who led the transition said, ""COVID-19 accelerated UCL's transition to the cloud. By enabling collaborative, multidisciplinary engineering, Fusion 360's next-generation platform equips our graduates to become the world's leading engineers of the future. While all our software remains free for educators and students, graduates continue to bring Fusion 360 with them into the workplace from startups through to the giants of manufacturing."" 
While we have moderated our license compliance activity during the pandemic, we continue to work with existing and potential customers to ensure they pay for the software they use and comply with our terms of use. Our goal remains to give noncompliant and legacy users access to the benefits of subscription access to flexible models. During the quarter, we closed 23 deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, 3 of which were over $1 million. 
For example, our European customer became aware during its transition to name users that its employees were accessing licenses and regions outside of the contract scope. Our premium plan provided them with the flexibility to manage all licenses centrally, monitor usage to remaining compliance and resulted in $1 million-plus deal. 
A leading supplier of industrial automation solutions based in Europe, who became a legacy customer 3 years ago, subscribed to our product design and manufacturing collection when we were able to demonstrate that recent workflow improvements and cloud-enabled functionality would allow them to win more business and improving communication with their own customers and improved efficiency through quicker layout in 2D and hand over to 3D in visualization. 
In closing, we continue to build a stronger Autodesk for the long term. Our early and sustained organic and strategic investment in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based in collaboration, combined with a successful transition to a SaaS business model, give us significant competitive advantages and confidence to grow in the double-digit range in the foreseeable future. 
We expect to have accelerating momentum during fiscal 2022, and we have multiple drivers that make us confident in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow targets of $2.4 billion and double-digit growth thereafter.

And that has a disproportionate impact on how we see revenue in Q1. But the way we look at it shaping up this year is Q1 is kind of the trough of the new business recovery, and we're going to be accelerating our new business growth out through the year into the second half of the year. In fact, we really see a world where most of the new business that didn't show up last year kind of reemerges as we head through this year. So it's important to see that, that business that disappeared last year didn't disappear. It just got shifted out. In fact, you're hearing a lot about the acceleration of digitization in multiple industries, and we're seeing that in our space in spades as well. 
And I think if we look at particular sectors, it's actually really going to be distributed across all the sectors in kind of similar ways. AEC is already investing really significantly ahead of the market in terms of their digitization efforts. You kind of saw early evidence of that with the EBA business we did, the record number of EBAs we did in Q4 relative to previous years. In manufacturing, you kind of see the same accelerated interest in digitization and new cloud-based workflows, especially surrounding what we're seeing in Fusion. The same goes in media and entertainment. The media and entertainment business, which was classically a laggard on some of these highly digital, highly cloud integrated workflows, is moving to the cloud in a big way. 
Now geographically, kind of in a broad brush, I kind of highlighted in the opening remarks that we saw a broad recovery in Europe and Asia to preCOVID levels of monthly active usage. And we saw a little bit of a lag in the U.S. and the U.K. I think we're going to see that kind of geographic return of new business in that cascade. It's going to be strong in APAC, it's going to get strong in Europe, and then it's going to start to come back in the U.S. and the U.K. Q1 will be the trough of this new business growth, and we're going to accelerate right out of that into the rest of the year."

So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did in Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projec",533,"Yes. Difference is an opportunity, Saket. So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did in Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projects take a long time to design and plan and they last even longer after that. So an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the long-term health of Autodesk. And I think we just have to be super clear about that. 
Water was one of those areas where it would have taken us a lot of time to catch up organically where is mode and rail is an area we've been highlighting to you that we've been investing in organically with our portfolio and really making great strides there. 
When you look at the business at a high level in terms of the differences and where the revenue is going to come from. So look, at a high level, Innovyze is going to be accretive to our revenue growth, roughly to a percentage point as we head into this year. That includes deferred revenue write-offs and the fact that we have all a partial year in here. It's probably going to be dilutive this year, about 1 percentage point off of operating margin. But here's the opportunity that I want to make sure you highlight, you actually poke on a little bit between the differences in our business model. 
Not only are we going to plug Innovyze into our sales engine in terms of named accounts, channel sales and international expansion, we're also going to apply our expertise on business model transformation to the Innovyze product portfolio. And I think that's going to be an important transitional element of how we absorb Innovyze into the company. We're good at this. We know how to do this, and we know how to navigate this. So what you're going to see in FY '23 is you'll probably see a little bit of a depression of Innovyze's revenue growth in isolation because we're going to be applying the business model transformation. 
And as you know, with the business model transformation, there's downward pressure in revenue as a result, but acceleration of revenue as you head out onto the other side of the business model transformation. So if we look at FY '23, it's probably going to be neutral to the overall revenue growth of the company. It's not going to touch the free cash flow number, $2.4 billion is going to come out, Innovyze or no Innovyze. And there'll probably be a little bit more of a headwind to operating margin, maybe between 1% and 2% as we go through the business model transformation, but a nice acceleration up to our double-digit growth standards as we head beyond FY '23 to '24, '25 and '26, which is kind of an extra bonus on top of what we're going to be able to do just to expand the core Innovyze water business to capitalize on the increasing investment in infrastructure. So it's a good question to talk about the differences in our business model because there's actually an opportunity there and a difference."

Our development team did an incredible heavy lift and an amazing job unifying what was the best of PlanGrid, which was the best of what we had in BIM 360. We now have Autodesk Build on this foundation of Autodesk Docs. And there is no one that has a better office to trailer solution than we do. 
And I think if you go out there and you talk to customers and you talk to the space and they look at what we've done with Autodesk Build, you're going to hear the same kind of feedback that we really built a great product. And that's the product we're going to be leading with on new business. It's not that we won't be leading on the acquired portfolio of products as we continue to sell those. But we're going to lead with build, and we're going to lead with build in many places. And that's going to give us a chance to not only drive successful international expansion, but also continue to lap some of our competitors in the rest of the market, especially in places like the mid-market. But another one of pieces of our secret sauce heading into the year, Phil, is the flexibility we offer on business models. 
We meet our customers wherever they are. And I think this is super important for you to pay attention to. We sell named user subscription. We sell site licenses. We sell project-based licensing when they want it. We sell consumption inside of EBAs. Whatever they need for whatever project they're pursuing, we have a model for them and a product for them. And I think that important convergence between the flexibility, which, by the way, costs us complex in the back end, but it's worth it in terms of meeting the customers where they are. 
When you combine that with the products, we feel really, really optimistic about how we're going to accelerate in this year and meet some of this demand. And our customers are looking for it. They want to digitize faster. They're starting to increase their spending. And we think we've got the portfolio of products and the portfolio of purchasing options that makes it work. We're not trying to force people into one kind of business model and then maybe try to lock them in, in kind of places that they don't want to be. So we feel pretty optimistic."

For instance, in terms of of channel, in terms of delivering on the platform, going live perhaps with PPU, other critical technical milestones that you my care to talk about in terms of new products like Tandem and Space Maker and so forth?  
And then secondly, on the last call, you noted that within your peer group, Autodesk is the largest R&D spender, which is the case. But could you talk in a little bit more detail about how you're allocating R&D?  Maybe talk about the priorities?  You've spoken of reinvesting in the A of AEC. And maybe talk about some of those critical investment priorities vis-à-vis R&D.?"

All right. So let's talk about some of the programmatic pieces here. Now I don't want to take any thunder away from this year's AU, which is where we talk a lot about. As you probably noticed with last AU, you're going to see more of a product announcement focused AU as we move forward. So I don't want to take any thunder away from that. 
But if you look at programmatically where we're going to be leaning into, platform enhancements that bring design and make and industries together and create commonality across many of the industries we serve are going to be a particular level that we're going to be moving with. We just hired a new CTO with a lot of platform strategy chops that we're going to be leveraging to integrate some deeper platform capabilities into the company. We're also going to be looking programmatically at the named user transition program. 
As you know, that was kind of a bumpy program last year. Customers really didn't appreciate us introducing that into a pandemic year. And they really want to understand what their options are with regards to flexible usage and the occasional use moving forward. So look for us to explore those kind of capabilities as we've extended out what the deadline was in that program, which still makes that program being executed faster than maintenance of subscription, but probably more on a time line that fits with what our customers can absorb. So you'll see us kind of look at those flexible options and explore some of those things with the customers. 
Now if you look specifically at how we're allocating investment. I mean, I think you saw what we did around the A in AEC. We acquired Space Maker. We're integrating that team, building up capabilities around that team, particularly around integrating machine learning and cloud-based platforms into the design process in architecture and engineering. So that investment is clear. We've highlighted it. You've just seen how we're investing in infrastructure and civil infrastructure. We already talked organically about road and rail, and now we've also talked about water. And all of this kind of builds on top of what we're doing with Construction Cloud. 
I haven't talked a lot about what we're going to be doing with manufacturing, but here's what I can tell you. We're very interested in the cloud transformation and manufacturing. And I think you'll see us lean deeply into the cloud transformation around manufacturing more. We've invested pretty heavily there. Our investment is large in Apple portfolio, particularly in the Fusion portfolio. I think you'll continue to see us to invest in that area. And as we head towards AU, you'll hear exciting things about Fusion. You'll hear exciting things about Tandem. You'll hear exciting things about the platform for the company. And you'll hear exciting things about how the AEC portfolio is starting to come together in a similar way that we brought together some of the construction portfolio acquisitions that we did previously.  So look for us to kind of play across all those fields. 
Now in terms of the breadth of what we're doing, I think I might have talked about this last time, we reverticalized the company just recently in October. So now I have someone that's responsible for the AEC execution again. That's Amy Bunszel, Scott Reese working on the execution in product design and manufacturing; and Diana working in the media and entertainment space. And they are working closely with me and the rest of the team to execute on these vertical priorities, while we've also elevated platform up to an executive staff level, reporting directly to me, which will allow us to synergize the platform efforts more tightly with those things. So we're doing this from an operational perspective as well as from a strategic investment perspective."

And there's a side of the bell curve for which 2:1 requires some more thought by the customer, more thought about. Okay, wait a second, my usage is greater than 2:1. Autodesk, what are you going to do to allow me to flex a little bit more? And EBA is too big for me. 
So what you saw early on is a lot of those people on the left side of the bell curve, the 50% of people that were up for renewal last year that said, ""Hey, this is good for me."" They moved quite rapidly through that, all right? The extension is for the people that require more thought about how this is going to impact their business and how they're going to adapt if their usage is greater than the 2:1 that the program had. So that's one of the reasons why we're working on the extension also to make ensure that we have the new flexible models out there for them to explore. So there's no change our expectations with regards to the impact on our business. It's going to be over the whole period of the program neutral in terms of impact to our business.

And yes, as we ended last fiscal year, right, we saw quite an interesting pickup in multiyear, frankly, more than we expected, all right, given that we were filling the pandemic year. But if we look at where we want to be, it's just a reversion back to the mean. And remember that the multiyear business is attractive to both our channel partners and our customers because our channel partners like to collect the cash upfront. And our customers like to lock in the price protection for multiple years. And if you recall, reversion to the mean historically for our maintenance business was about 30% of the business, all right, roughly speaking, right? 
We want to stay right within that domain, and we will probably stay within that domain for the foreseeable future. And that was key, it's not the mean, okay?  It peaked to 30%, not in the mid. The mean was probably somewhere in the mid-20s."

So we actually overperformed based on our expectations on renewal rates of the business. We continue to see -- we continue to expect that to accelerate. 
But more importantly, the net revenue retention is going to be driven by more and more people incorporating our digital portfolios, Construction Cloud, Fusion, other types of products like that and also moving to BIM in the AEC space. So look for a lot of the increases in net revenue retention to be programmatically driven by the move to BIM, the move to digitizing the cloud -- in Construction Cloud and the move to transform their manufacturing processes with Fusion 360 and other solutions like that."

So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1? So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite ra",512,"Yes. So this is a really important question. So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1? So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite rapidly out of Q1, but what actually drives the revenue guide in Q1?  The most important thing is the revenue recognition. So let's look at last year. 
Last year, we did not grow new business to the degree we expected to. In fact, we saw a decline year-over-year in our new business. The impact of those declines in new business bookings in the previous year have a disproportionately large effect on Q1. But they work themselves out relatively quickly as you move into Q2, Q3, Q4 and beyond. So we absolutely do have a somewhat more back-end loaded year than we would in a classic Autodesk year. But not extremely to the degree, simply because of the hole that was created. 
And I think I said earlier, the new business that we lost in last year didn't disappear. It's coming back. And it's coming back with a vengeance as we head into next year. But there's a couple of other little factors that affect Q1 disproportionately. And I think it's really important that we all get grounded on some of these things. 
So the first one is we have a set of products that -- because they are not yet cloud-enabled to a certain degree, are recognized upfront in the revenue in the accounting rules. They have to be. We have been working hard to ensure that all of those products are cloud-enabled, and that will actually force them to be recognized ratably. 
One of the products that is moving from upfront recognition to ratable recognition is the Vault product family. And that Vault product family was providing quite a bit of upfront revenue recognition previously. And now as we enter Q1, it's all going to be recognized ratably because Vault now has a mobile client. It now has other cloud-enabled features in it. So that was all of a sudden, a headwind to revenue recognition in Q1, but it works itself out as the year progresses, as the ratability progresses and the buildup progresses. And this is just the way a subscription business model works. 
So there's some unusual sort of onetime headwinds to Q1 that unwind themselves fairly quickly. And Q1 is the trough, and we will accelerate out of there. But it's definitely related to the buildup of recognized revenue as we progress. So that -- I hope that helps you understand a little bit more how Q1 works. And yes, there are some additional little details like Q1 is 1 day shorter this year, year-over-year. So it's actually one less day of revenue in the quarter. And it's 3 days shorter than quarter-over-quarter. But those other things I talked about are much more important for understanding the Q1 guide and how it unwinds as the year progresses. Makes sense?"

So remember, first off that we are distributed across almost all facets of the industry, and it's important to realize that when one wobbles another one pops up. So -- and we're absolutely seeing that pattern. So for instance, you see in commercial real estate development, you see a slowing of projects. You actually do see a rebooting of projects that have been put on hold by the pandemic. But you see a slowing of new projects, but you see other new projects coming in the pipeline in terms of urban multifamily housing, suburban multifamily housing, other types of commercial real estate outside of dense urban areas, right? So we're hearing a lot from customers about a shift in where their portfolios are moving to. 
One thing we are getting consistently though is an ongoing focus on adopting certain aspects of our cloud portfolio, particularly what we do with Autodesk build collaboration, the collaboration tools for Revit models. We're seeing a lot of increased adoption in that. We saw a lot of strength last year. We're seeing some of that strengthening in. I think that's going to be an important part of our portfolio moving forward. Because not only does it allow for seamless remote work, but it also allows for better downstream integration to the rest of the build process. So we're seeing a lot of those tools being adopted, and we're also seeing a lot more adoption of some of the cloud-based tools that we're seeing in manufacturing. So the cloud is definitely front and center in terms of some of the growth areas, our portfolio, but do not underestimate BIM and enrollment Revit in the digitization of AEC, it will continue to be a strong driver in the new world order. But it's uneven. It cuts very across geographies, across segments. You definitely see differences in terms of where people are going to seeing things booting up and where they see things slowing down. But like every cycle we've ever seen, the money just shifts to somewhere else."

So first off, I want to make sure that I just reiterate something I've said many times before. We model our business with super high facility, okay? And within those models, we never put forward our best case, right? We always had a buffer in there at some degree. Buffers are great for like pandemic ears. You got -- you love it when you have a buffer. 
Now of course, as you get closer to events like FY '23 and things like associated with that, the buffer gets smaller, but so does -- but the accuracy of your model also gets better as well, right?  So we have super -- we have a lot of confidence in the buildup to FY '23, the $2.4 billion in free cash flow. The organic metrics surrounding our business. And we also have a lot of confidence in the double-digit growth as we head beyond fiscal '23. Fiscal '23 isn't some event, it's just another milepost like fiscal '20 was, fiscal '23 is. It's another mile post on a journey but there is ongoing growth in the double-digit range out beyond fiscal '23. 
Now I think one of the things people anchor on right now is what about this buildup from '22 to '23? One of the things I want to remind you is about the nature of how momentum is going to be exiting '22. Remember, we're -- we're going to be slightly more back-end loaded in terms of the accumulation of revenue and new business heading into fiscal '23, not dramatically back-end loaded, but more back-end loaded than we would traditionally be. We're going to exit '23 with quite a bit more momentum than the full year targets would indicate, all right, relatively speaking, in terms of those outcomes. 
So we feel pretty confident with the momentum we'll exit FY '23 with and that we have the book of business from the renewal base, from the continuing digitization of AEC, from the continuing convergence of design and making manufacturing and to the conversion of noncompliant users to hit the numbers that we have in FY '23 and beyond. And we're confident in our models. We're confident in the margin of error. We're confident in the levers we can pull if we had to pull any. So we see line of sight to some of the organic goals that we've been talking about. And we continue to be confident even with what seems to be a big buildup from '22 to '23, you just have to pay attention to the momentum we have as we exit the full year '22 into '23.  No different than that '19 to '20 discussion that we had. It seem like yesterday, but it was 3 years ago."

So first off, our customers have to invest ahead of their project load in order to be successful. Remember, our tools show up not only in the execution phase and the make phase, but also very early in the early conceptual design phases. And one of the big areas of strength that we saw in Q4 was that large increase in enterprise business agreements we see. The record number of EBAs we saw is kind of an emblematic of customers investing in future digitization capacity. So we expect to see that regardless of the situation in the markets right now. 
But our view continues to be Q1 is the trough. The acceleration starts to come out of Q1 as we head out of the spring and into the summer. Now right now, there's lots of uncertainty, and you hear lots of buzz around variants and vaccine distributions. But I think all of us are smart enough to know that just like when we had these discussions about testing infrastructure and testing rollout and testing capacity, all these things work themselves out over a multi-month period in terms of distribution of vaccines, distribution of assignment of capacity and all the things associated with that. 
Now if all of that stuff starts to crumble and bumble, of course, you end up in a new situation, but you know what, that is highly unlikely in this situation. And there's much more alignment on trying to get the right things done. And that's what we're hearing from our customers more and more is they're trying to invest ahead of the growth they see coming forward. So we're pretty bullish as we head into the second half of the year. And we're pretty optimistic as we head into the summer. There's always something that can derail this, a wobble in the vaccine distribution or something associated with that or some kind of rise of political uncertainty. But you know what, we can't predict those things, and we don't see those things. We see mostly are tailwinds right now as we head out of Q1 and into Q2 and beyond."

And on this conversion -- this convergence of manufacturing and construction across our industries, we've got a lot of organic focus in the innovation in those areas. We will acquire inorganically for innovation in certain cloud-based areas. But more likely than not, we'll acquire for vertical specialization in areas where established businesses have created a presence.  indicative for that. Sorry."

I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy.
Before jumping into our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to again thank our employees and the families and communities that support them as well as our partners and customers for their continued commitment during uncertain times. That commitment, combined with our resilient subscription business model and the secular shift to the cloud, enabled us to maintain momentum and exceed our goals.
We generated strong growth with full year subscription revenue and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, up 26% and 19%, respectively. We also made significant progress towards digitizing AEC, converging design and make in manufacturing and converting noncompliant and legacy users. We signed a record number of new Enterprise Business Agreements, or EBAs, in the fourth quarter. In fact, they were equal to the number we signed in the entirety of the previous year. That's a testament both to our execution and growing partnership with our enterprise customers as we enable their digital transformations, demonstrated by enterprise BIM 360 usage nearly doubling year-over-year. While we made great strides this year, we intend to extend our leadership in the cloud and expand our presence in existing and adjacent industry verticals across the globe. 
The pending acquisition of Innovyze, which we announced yesterday and is expected to close later this quarter, is a great example of that intent. Innovyze is a global leader in water infrastructure simulation and modeling, serving many of the world's largest utilities, the majority of the top ENR design firms and other leading environmental and engineering consultancies. Innovyze enables water distribution networks and drainage systems to be more cost effectively and sustainably designed and operated. Combined with Civil 3D, InfraWorks, Revit and Autodesk Construction Cloud, we would be able to provide end-to-end water and wastewater solutions across planning, design, construction and operations. 
With our existing capabilities in road and rail and our partnership with Aurigo and capital planning, we now have end-to-end infrastructure solutions for facilities owners and public sector agencies. Autodesk provides Innovyze with multiple opportunities to scale through enterprise, channel sales and geographic expansion. We also intend to apply our expertise in navigating through a business model transition to drive additional growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to the future with optimism. 
In the near term, we expect the unwinding of uncertainty from vaccine availability and political stability to drive confidence and investment over the second half of the year. Over the long term, Autodesk's purpose to drive efficiency and sustainability has never been more relevant or urgent. 
In partnership with our customers, we have an unmatched capacity to drive efficiency and meet the global challenges of carbon emissions, embedded carbon, water scarcity and waste. And Autodesk is playing its part. We are on track to meet our commitment to be climate neutral and remain dedicated to being a resilient, diverse and equitable company. We were most recently recognized by Barron's as #4 on their list of World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies and the highest ranked software company. We are proud of our impact at Autodesk, and through our customers, the impact we are making in the wider world. 
I'm also thrilled to announce 2 strong additions to my team. Debbie Clifford will be returning to Autodesk as Chief Financial Officer; and Raji Arasu will be joining as Chief Technology Officer. Debbie is currently Chief Financial Officer at SurveyMonkey, but spent the 13 years prior to that role in various financial leadership roles at Autodesk, including leading the internal business model transition team, engaging with many of you in support of our investor outreach and as my finance business partner before I became CEO. With her leadership skills, expertise and passion for our mission, Autodesk finance team will not miss a beat. 
Raji joins us from Intuit, where she currently serves as Senior Vice President of their Platform and Services business. Prior to that, she was CTO for eBay subsidiary StubHub. At Autodesk, she will oversee and be responsible to the Autodesk technology and platform strategy as well as being operationally responsible for the ongoing development of our platform services. Raji will replace current Autodesk CTO, Scott Borduin, who announced his intent to retire last year after more than 21 years of service to the company. Scott had 2 tours as Autodesk CEO, the prior one working for Carol Bartz, and has not only contributed to the rise of Inventor and Fusion to the products they are today, but also as a passionate evangelist for Autodesk and our vision. Emblematic of his dedication to Autodesk, he moved out his retirement date so that he can help Raji during her transition into Autodesk. I'd like to give Scott a heartfelt thank you for all he's done and is continuing to do.
Before I provide insight into our strategic growth drivers, let me take you through the details of our quarterly and full year performance and the guidance for the next year. In an extraordinary year, we performed strongly across all metrics, perhaps best encapsulated by the sum of our revenue growth and free cash flow margin for the year equaling 51%.  Several factors contributed to that strength in the fourth quarter, including record EBAs, robust subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales and continued sequential growth in new business. 
Total revenue growth in the quarter was 16%, both as reported and in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 22% and now representing approximately 91% of total revenue. There was approximately 2 percentage points of benefit to subscription and maintenance growth from upfront revenue recognition of some products that do not incorporate substantial cloud services.
Looking at revenue by product and geography. AutoCAD and LT revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the year. AEC grew 18% in Q4 and 20% for the year. Manufacturing rose 17% in Q4 and 10% for the year, even excluding the benefit from a strong performance in automotive EBAs which include nonratable VRED revenue, Manufacturing grew double digits in the quarter. M&E grew 14% in the quarter, boosted by a strong performance from our collaboration platform Shotgun and was up 10% for the year. Geographically, revenue growth ticked up in all regions. Revenue grew 14% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 23% in APAC during the quarter. 
We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 28% versus last year and represented 34% of our total sales, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of last year. The strength in our direct business was driven by some nonratable products included in a few large EBAs and digital sales. 
During the year, we grew total subscriptions by 8% to $5.3 million. Excluding the multiuser trade-in program, total subscriptions grew 4% to $5.1 million. Subscription plan subscriptions grew 15% and by 10%, excluding the multi-user trade-in program. We added 130,000 main subscriptions due to the strong adoption of our BIM 360 family and Fusion 360 products.
During Q4, our maintenance, conversion and renewal rates declined sequentially, which was expected as we are entering the final stages of our maintenance to subscription program. With only 1 quarter left before this program retires, we have approximately 126,000 maintenance subscriptions remaining, accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. I am proud to share that we have converted over 1.3 million maintenance subscriptions to date. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the lion's share of our commercial subscriptions were named users benefiting from easier access, usage data visibility and secure license management. We anticipate many of our remaining multi-user subscribers will make the transition to named users as the pandemic recedes. And we are now extending our 2:1 multi-user trade-in to August 2023 to enable that. 
As announced last November, we are also exploring consumption-based models to meet the needs of customers requiring flexible license usage. Our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100 to 110 percentage range we laid out in our guidance. Our product subscription renewal rates remain robust, reinforcing the business-critical nature of our products to our customers. 
Our billings were broadly level with last year, reflecting fewer multiyear sales, and our long-term deferred revenue was 26% of total deferred revenue in Q4. Our total RPO of $4.2 billion is up 19%, and our current RPO of $2.7 billion grew 16%. 
On margins, we continue to realize good operating leverage due to strong revenue growth and diligent expense management. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margins remained very strong at 93%, up 1 percentage point from last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 29%.
As you have seen in our press release, our GAAP results include a $679 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance released in the fourth quarter. This largely reflects the completion of our business model transition and the significant growth in our profitability. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurpose shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 530,000 shares for $157 million at an average price of approximately $295 per share. For the full year, we purchased 2.6 million shares for $549 million at an average price of approximately $208 per share. 
Now let me turn to our guidance, which does not include Innovyze. We expect an improving macroeconomic environment during the year will result in accelerating growth in new business over the course of fiscal 2022. Usage trends during the fourth quarter remained above pre-COVID levels in most of Asia Pacific and Continental Europe and below pre-COVID levels in the U.S. and U.K. 
We have seen an uptick in interest from multiyear deals, growing optimism in the channel and gradual recovery in bid activity on BuildingConnected in the U.S. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be very healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. 
Given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. For fiscal 2022, we expect revenue to grow by 13% to 15%, margins to expand to between 31% and 32% and free cash flow growth to reaccelerate to approximately 20%. When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal 2022, we expect about 3/4 of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our macroeconomic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. 
As we noted last quarter, Vault revenue is becoming ratable for fiscal 2022 with the release of significant new mobile fee functionality in the first quarter. And this will reduce our revenue growth by about 1 percentage point over the year, with the biggest impact in our revenue on the P&L and in the manufacturing product family. 
Looking at our guidance for the first quarter. Normal seasonality is compounded by Vault ratability and one fewer calendar day versus Q1 fiscal 2021, which together reduces year-on-year revenue growth in the first quarter by about 2 percentage points. With improving macroeconomic conditions and easing comparables, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate after the first quarter. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for fiscal first quarter and full year 2022. 
We expect Innovyze to be accretive to revenue growth, broadly neutral to free cash flow and a headwind on reported operating margins in fiscal 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details after the Innovyze transaction completes. 
Let me finish by giving you some details on the progress we made executing on our strategy to digitize AEC, converge design and make in manufacturing and monetize noncompliant and legacy users. Early in February, we launched our Autodesk Construction Cloud platform, which unifies our organic and acquired AEC cloud offerings and the data held within them to enable a connected project ecosystem across design and construction. 
Underpinning the Autodesk Construction Cloud is our common data environment, Autodesk Docs. This provides seamless navigation, integrated workflows and project controls and enables a single source of truth across the project life cycle. Autodesk Build brings together the best of PlanGrid and BIM 360 with new functionality, which along with Autodesk Quantify and BIM Collaborate, creates a comprehensive suite of field construction and project management solutions. 
For our design customers, BIM Collaborate Pro extends the capabilities of BIM 360 design on the new platform to create a more seamless exchange of project data between design and construction. Our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. We have pursued that strategy to create Autodesk Construction Cloud, we are pursuing that strategy and infrastructure with the acquisition of Innovyze and we will continue to pursue that strategy in manufacturing. 
The reasons for and the benefits of this strategy were clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Our growing partnership with our enterprise customers, as we enable their digital transformations, resulted both in record number of EBAs in the fourth quarter and also strong expansion in renewal rates with existing EBA customers. 
We are seeing our new products, typically used by contractors, being increasingly adopted by design firms. For example, we expanded our agreement with Jacobs, the world's largest design firm to include Pipe, PlanGrid and Assemble to enable greater collaboration and more efficient workflows. Autodesk has been a trusted partner of Jacobs over the last 30 years, aligned with its mission to challenge today and reinvent tomorrow. Jacobs is also using Autodesk's transformative services to help them deliver innovative solutions to their customers. For example, Autodesk and Jacobs partnered to deliver the world's first generatively designed airport in Australia. And together, we are focused on leveraging Generative Design to solve their other client challenges around the world. 
Environmental Air Systems, EAS, a full-service mechanical contractor and custom-built HVAC equipment manufacturer, which is on the forefront of industrialized construction, increased its investment with Autodesk by replacing its existing project management tool with BIM 360. It is now able to leverage its existing investment in AEC collections and provide a comprehensive tool for its teams to collaborate and to connect the office and the field. 
And Tyréns, a leading sustainable urban development consultancy in Sweden, significantly expanded its strategic platform partnership with Autodesk. As Per Bjälnes, Tyréns' Digital Strategy Manager for Business Area X said, ""Tyréns is at the leading edge of the digital transformation of the construction and maintenance industry. Digitization enables smart buildings design that requires secure data flows and seamless collaboration across a broad ecosystem of stakeholders during the construction and operations process. Autodesk's Revit and BIM 360 Docs empowered us to create true digital representations. And now with Autodesk Forge, we can leverage those assets as digital twins to create value for different stakeholders such as a reduction of energy consumption, the prediction and optimization of maintenance and new smart, seamless end user services.""
We are also seeing benefits from our strategy in manufacturing. In the automotive sector, we provide design software through our enterprise business agreements to nearly all of the largest automotive OEMs and are extending our footprint beyond design into the factory. For example, our expanded partnership with Rivian, a global provider of electric adventure vehicles, now extends across facilities with Revit, BIM 360 and PlanGrid, manufacturing with Inventor and Generative Design and in the design studio with Alias, VRED and Shotgun. We are able to support Rivian as it converts existing facilities to digital twins, optimizes its factory layout using Generative Design, improves energy efficiency through simulation and enables collaboration and efficiency using a common data environment.
Similarly, we are providing end-to-end support to our long-term customer, Transmashholding, TMH, which is the largest manufacturing of rolling stock and rail equipment in Russia and CIS, to accelerate its digital transformation and converge its design and make processes. TMH now builds trains in concept in Alias, designs and engineers in Inventor, optimizes in Fusion, produces and PowerMill and sells in VRED.
Our market-leading cloud-based platform, Fusion 360, enjoyed another quarter of accelerating subscriptions, growing scale of deployments and adding competitive displacements, ending the quarter with over 140,000 commercial subscriptions. Conturo Prototyping, a machine shop based in Pittsburgh, recently expanded its relationship with Autodesk by adding more fusion seats. Conturo is also adopting our recently launched machining extension due to its integrated design and CAM work flows, its advanced manufacturing capability and the potential of Generative Design to reduce project time lines and solve design for manufacturing issues faster than ever before.
In education, we continue to expand our footprint and replace traditional CAD competitors. With Tinkercad and Fusion alone, Autodesk is now approaching 40 million education users worldwide. For example, all of University College London's mechanical engineers switched to Fusion 360 during the fourth quarter. As Professor Tim Baker, MBE, who led the transition said, ""COVID-19 accelerated UCL's transition to the cloud. By enabling collaborative, multidisciplinary engineering, Fusion 360's next-generation platform equips our graduates to become the world's leading engineers of the future. While all our software remains free for educators and students, graduates continue to bring Fusion 360 with them into the workplace, from startups through to the giants of manufacturing."" 
While we have moderated our license compliance activity during the pandemic, we continue to work with existing and potential customers to ensure they pay for the software they use and comply with our terms of use. Our goal remains to give noncompliant and legacy users access to the benefits of subscription access through flexible models. During the quarter, we closed 23 deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, 3 of which were over $1 million.
For example, our European customer became aware during its transition to named users that its employees were accessing licenses in regions outside of the contract scope. Our premium plan provided them with the flexibility to manage all licenses centrally, monitor usage to remaining compliance and resulted in $1 million-plus deal. And a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions based in Europe, who became a legacy customer 3 years ago, subscribed to our product design and manufacturing collection when we were able to demonstrate that recent workflow improvements and cloud-enabled functionality would allow them to win more business by improving communication with their own customers and improve efficiency through quicker layout in 2D and hand over to 3D in visualization. 
In closing, we continue to build a stronger Autodesk for the long term. Our early and sustained organic and strategic investment in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, combined with a successful transition to a SaaS business model, give us significant competitive advantages and confidence to grow in the double-digit range in the foreseeable future. We expect to have accelerating momentum during fiscal 2022, and we have multiple drivers that make us confident in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion and double-digit growth thereafter. 
With that, operator, we would like to now open the call up for questions."

And that has a disproportionate impact on how we see revenue in Q1. But the way we look at it shaping up this year is Q1 is kind of the trough of the new business recovery, and we're going to be accelerating our new business growth out through the year into the second half of the year. In fact, we really see a world where most of the new business that didn't show up last year kind of reemerges as we head through this year. So it's important to see that, that business that disappeared last year didn't disappear. It just got shifted out. In fact, you're hearing a lot about the acceleration of digitization in multiple industries, and we're seeing that in our space in spades as well. 
And I think if we look at particular sectors, it's actually really going to be distributed across all the sectors in kind of similar ways. AEC is already investing really significantly ahead of the market in terms of their digitization efforts. You kind of saw early evidence of that with the EBA business we did, the record number of EBAs we did in Q4 relative to previous years. In manufacturing, you kind of see the same accelerated interest in digitization and new cloud-based workflows, especially surrounding what we're seeing in Fusion. The same goes in media and entertainment. The media and entertainment business, which was classically a laggard on some of these highly digital, highly cloud integrated workflows, is moving to the cloud in a big way. 
Now geographically, kind of in a broad brush, I kind of highlighted in the opening remarks that we saw a broad recovery in Europe and Asia to pre-COVID levels of monthly active usage. And we saw a little bit of a lag in the U.S. and the U.K. I think we're going to see that kind of geographic return of new business in that cascade. It's going to be strong in APAC, it's going to get strong in Europe and then it's going to start to come back in the U.S. and the U.K. Q1 will be the trough of this new business growth, and we're going to accelerate right out of that into the rest of the year."

119902,702894090,2225431,"Autodesk, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Difference is an opportunity, Saket. So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projects",532,"Yes. Difference is an opportunity, Saket. So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projects take a long time to design and plan, and they last even longer after that. So an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the long-term health of Autodesk. And I think we just have to be super clear about that. 
Water was one of those areas where it would have taken us a lot of time to catch up organically. Whereas road and rail is an area we've been highlighting to you that we've been investing in organically with our portfolio and really making great strides there.
When you look at the business at a high level in terms of the differences and where the revenue is going to come from. So look, at a high level, Innovyze is going to be accretive to our revenue growth, roughly to 1 percentage point as we head into this year. And that includes deferred revenue write-offs and the fact that we have a partial year in here. It's probably going to be dilutive this year, about 1 percentage point off of operating margin. 
But here's the opportunity that I want to make sure you highlight, and you actually poked on a little bit between the differences in our business model. Not only are we going to plug Innovyze into our sales engine in terms of named accounts, channel sales and international expansion, we're also going to apply our expertise on business model transformation to the Innovyze product portfolio. And I think that's going to be an important transitional element of how we absorb Innovyze into the company. We're good at this, we know how to do this and we know how to navigate this. So what you're going to see in FY '23 is you'll probably see a little bit of a depression of Innovyze's revenue growth in isolation because we're going to be applying the business model transformation. And as you know, with the business model transformation, there's downward pressure in revenue as a result, but acceleration of revenue as you head out onto the other side of the business model transformation. 
So if we look at FY '23, it's probably going to be neutral to the overall revenue growth of the company. It's not going to touch the free cash flow number, $2.4 billion is going to come out, Innovyze or no Innovyze. And there'll probably be a little bit more of a headwind to operating margin, maybe between 1% and 2% as we go through the business model transformation, but a nice acceleration up to our double-digit growth standards as we head beyond FY '23 to '24, '25 and '26, which is kind of an extra bonus on top of what we're going to be able to do just to expand the core Innovyze water business to capitalize on the increasing investment in infrastructure. So it's a good question to talk about the differences in our business model because there's actually an opportunity there and a difference."

119902,702894090,2225431,"Autodesk, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

So we actually started to see the early signs of that as we headed into Q4 as new business started to strengthen in our construction portfolio in particular. And we also saw it across the Fusion base as well as people started to look at their manufacturing and the design-to-manufacturing operations. So we see a pretty significant opportunity here. And look, in many ways, the pandemic gave us an opportunity to catch up and pull ahead a little bit here. Our portfolio is now best-in-class. Our development team did an incredible heavy lift and an amazing job unifying what was the best of PlanGrid, which was the best of what we had in BIM 360. We now have Autodesk Build on this foundation of Autodesk Docs. And there is no one that has a better office-to-trailer solution than we do. 
And I think if you go out there and you talk to customers and you talk to the space and they look at what we've done with Autodesk Build, you're going to hear the same kind of feedback that we really built a great product. And that's the product we're going to be leading with on new business. It's not that we won't be leading on the acquired portfolio of products as we continue to sell those. But we're going to lead with Build, and we're going to lead with Build in many places. And that's going to give us a chance to not only drive successful international expansion, but also continue to lap some of our competitors in the rest of the market, especially in places like the mid-market. 
But another one of the pieces of our secret sauce heading into the year, Phil, is the flexibility we offer on business models. We meet our customers wherever they are. And I think this is super important for you to pay attention to. We sell named user subscription. We sell site licenses. We sell project-based licensing when they want it. We sell consumption inside of EBAs. Whatever they need for whatever project they're pursuing, we have a model for them and a product for them. And I think that important convergence between the flexibility, which, by the way, costs us complex in the back end, but it's worth it in terms of meeting the customers where they are. 
When you combine that with the products, we feel really, really optimistic about how we're going to accelerate in this year and meet some of this demand. And our customers are looking for it. They want to digitize faster. They're starting to increase their spending. And we think we've got the portfolio of products and the portfolio of purchasing options that makes it work. We're not trying to force people into one kind of business model and then maybe try to lock them in, in kind of places that they don't want to be. So we feel pretty optimistic."

And then secondly, on the last call, you noted that within your peer group, Autodesk is the largest R&D spender, which is the case. But could you talk in a little bit more detail about how you're allocating R&D? Maybe talk about the priorities. You've spoken of reinvesting in the A of AEC.

All right. So let's talk about some of the programmatic pieces here. Now I don't want to take any thunder away from this year's AU, which is where we talk a lot about. As you probably noticed with last AU, you're going to see more of a product announcement focused AU as we move forward. So I don't want to take any thunder away from that. 
But if you look at programmatically where we're going to be leaning into, platform enhancements that bring design and make in the industries together and create commonality across many of the industries we serve are going to be a particular lever that we're going to be moving with. We just hired a new CTO with a lot of platform strategy chops that we're going to be leveraging to integrate some deeper platform capabilities into the company. 
We're also going to be looking programmatically at the named user transition program. As you know, that was kind of a bumpy program last year. Customers really didn't appreciate us introducing that into a pandemic year. And they really want to understand what their options are with regards to flexible usage and occasional use moving forward. So look for us to explore those kind of capabilities as we've extended out what the deadline was in that program, which still makes that program being executed faster than maintenance of subscription, but probably more on a time line that fits with what our customers can absorb. So you'll see us kind of look at those flexible options and explore some of those things with our customers.
Now if you look specifically at how we're allocating investment. I mean I think you saw what we did around the A in AEC. We acquired Spacemaker. We're integrating that team, building up capabilities around that team, particularly around integrating machine learning and cloud-based platforms into the design process in architecture and engineering. So that investment is clear. We've highlighted it. You've just seen how we're investing in infrastructure and civil infrastructure. We already talked organically about road and rail, and now we've also talked about water. And all of this kind of builds on top of what we're doing with Construction Cloud. 
I haven't talked a lot about what we're going to be doing with manufacturing, but here's what I can tell you. We're very interested in the cloud transformation in manufacturing. And I think you'll see us lean deeply into the cloud transformation around manufacturing more. We've invested pretty heavily there. Our investment is large in that whole portfolio, particularly in the Fusion portfolio. I think you'll continue to see us to invest in that area. And as we head towards AU, you'll hear exciting things about Fusion. You'll hear exciting things about Tandem. You'll hear exciting things about the platform for the company. And you'll hear exciting things about how the AEC portfolio is starting to come together in a similar way that we brought together some of the construction portfolio acquisitions that we did previously. So look for us to kind of play across all those fields. 
Now in terms of the breadth of what we're doing, I think I might have talked about this last time. We reverticalized the company just recently in October. So now I have someone that's responsible for the AEC execution again. That's Amy Bunszel. Scott Reese working on the execution in product design and manufacturing. And Diana Colella working in the media and entertainment space. And they are working closely with me and the rest of the team to execute on these vertical priorities, while we've also elevated platform up to an executive staff level, reporting directly to me, which will allow us to synergize the platform efforts more tightly with those things. So we're doing this from an operational perspective as well as from a strategic investment perspective."

There's the size of the bell curve for which 2:1 is like, hey, that's a no-brainer for me, I'm going to take the 2:1. And there's a side of the bell curve for which 2:1 requires some more thought by the customer, more thought about, ""Okay, wait a second, my usage is greater than 2:1. Autodesk, what are you going to do to allow me to flex a little bit more? And EBA is too big for me.""
So what you saw early on is a lot of those people on the left side of the bell curve, the 50% of people that were up for renewal last year that said, ""Hey, this is good for me."" They moved quite rapidly through that, all right? The extension is for the people that require more thought about how this is going to impact their business and how they're going to adapt if their usage is greater than the 2:1 that the program had. 
So that's one of the reasons why we're working on the extension. Also to making sure that we have the new flexible models out there for them to explore. So there's no change in our expectations with regards to the impact on our business. It's going to be over, the whole period of the program, neutral in terms of impact to our business.

So we actually overperformed based on our expectations on renewal rates of the business. We continue to see -- we continue to expect that to accelerate.
But more importantly, the net revenue retention is going to be driven by more and more people incorporating our digital portfolios, Construction Cloud, Fusion, other types of products like that, and also moving to BIM in the AEC space. So look for a lot of the increases in net revenue retention to be programmatically driven by the move to BIM, the move to digitizing the cloud -- in Construction Cloud and the move to transform their manufacturing processes with Fusion 360 and other solutions like that."

So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1. So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite ra",510,"Yes. So this is a really important question. So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1. So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite rapidly out of Q1, but what actually drives the revenue guide in Q1? The most important thing is the revenue recognition. 
So let's look at last year. Last year, we did not grow new business to the degree we expected to. In fact, we saw a decline year-over-year in our new business. The impact of those declines in new business bookings in the previous year have a disproportionately large effect on Q1. But they work themselves out relatively quickly as you move into Q2, Q3, Q4 and beyond. So we absolutely do have a somewhat more back-end loaded year than we would in a classic Autodesk year. But not extremely to the degree, simply because of the hole that was created. 
And I think I said earlier, the new business that we lost last year didn't disappear. It's coming back. And it's coming back with a vengeance as we head into next year. But there's a couple of other little factors that affect Q1 disproportionately. And I think it's really important that we all get grounded on some of these things.
So the first one is we have a set of products that, because they are not yet cloud-enabled to a certain degree, are recognized upfront in the revenue in the accounting rules. They have to be. We have been working hard to ensure that all of those products are cloud-enabled, and that will actually force them to be recognized ratably.
One of the products that is moving from upfront recognition to ratable recognition is the Vault product family. And that Vault product family was providing quite a bit of upfront revenue recognition previously. And now as we enter Q1, it's all going to be recognized ratably because Vault now has a mobile client, it now has other cloud-enabled features in it. So that was all of a sudden, a headwind to revenue recognition in Q1, but it works itself out as the year progresses, as the ratability progresses and the buildup progresses. And this is just the way a subscription business model works. So there's some unusual sort of onetime headwinds to Q1 that unwind themselves fairly quickly. And Q1 is the trough, and we will accelerate out of there. But it's definitely related to the buildup of recognized revenue as we progress. So that -- I hope that helps you understand a little bit more how Q1 works. 
And yes, there are some additional little details like Q1 is 1 day shorter this year, year-over-year. So it's actually one less day of revenue in the quarter. And it's 3 days shorter than quarter-over-quarter. But those other things I talked about are much more important for understanding the Q1 guide and how it unwinds as the year progresses. Makes sense?"

So remember, first off that we are distributed across almost all facets of the industry, and it's important to realize that when one wobbles, another one pops up. So -- and we're absolutely seeing that pattern. So for instance, you see in commercial real estate development, you see a slowing of projects. You actually do see a rebooting of projects that have been put on hold by the pandemic. But you see a slowing of new projects, but you see other new projects coming in the pipeline in terms of urban multifamily housing, suburban multifamily housing, other types of commercial real estate outside of dense urban areas, right? So we're hearing a lot from customers about a shift in where their portfolios are moving to. 
One thing we are getting consistently though is an ongoing focus on adopting certain aspects of our cloud portfolio, particularly what we do with Autodesk Build collaboration, the collaboration tools for Revit models. We're seeing a lot of increased adoption in that. We saw a lot of strength last year. We're seeing some of that strength heading in. I think that's going to be an important part of our portfolio moving forward because not only does it allow for seamless remote work, but it also allows for better downstream integration to the rest of the build process. So we're seeing a lot of those tools being adopted, and we're also seeing a lot more adoption of some of the cloud-based tools that we're seeing in manufacturing. 
So the cloud is definitely front and center in terms of some of the growth areas in our portfolio. But do not underestimate BIM and the role of Revit in the digitization of AEC. It will continue to be a strong driver in the new world order. But it's uneven. It cuts very -- across geographies, across segments. You definitely see differences in terms of where people are going to seeing things booting up and where they see things slowing down. But like every cycle we've ever seen, the money just shifts to somewhere else."

So first off, I want to make sure that I just reiterate something I've said many times before. We model our business with super high fidelity, okay? And within those models, we never put forward our best case, all right? We always had a buffer in there at some degree. Buffers are great for like pandemic years. You got -- you love it when you have a buffer.
Now of course, as you get closer to events like FY '23 and things like associated with that, the buffer gets smaller, but so does -- but the accuracy of your model also gets better as well, right? So we have super -- we have a lot of confidence in the buildup to FY '23, the $2.4 billion in free cash flow, the organic metrics surrounding our business. And we also have a lot of confidence in the double-digit growth as we head beyond fiscal '23. Fiscal '23 isn't some event. It's just another milepost like fiscal '20 was, fiscal '23 is. It's another milepost on a journey but there is ongoing growth in the double-digit range out beyond fiscal '23. 
Now I think one of the things people anchor on right now is what about this buildup from '22 to '23? One of the things I want to remind you is about the nature of how momentum is going to be exiting '22. Remember, we're slight -- we're going to be slightly more back-end loaded in terms of the accumulation of revenue and new business heading into fiscal '23, not dramatically back-end loaded, but more back-end loaded than we would traditionally be. We're going to exit '23 with quite a bit more momentum than the full year targets would indicate, all right, relatively speaking, in terms of those outcomes. 
So we feel pretty confident with the momentum we'll exit FY '23 with and that we have the book of business from the renewal base, from the continuing digitization of AEC, from the continuing convergence of design and make in manufacturing and to the conversion of noncompliant users to hit the numbers that we have in FY '23 and beyond. And we're confident in our models. We're confident in the margin of error. We're confident in the levers we can pull, if we had to pull any. So we see line of sight to some of the organic goals that we've been talking about. And we continue to be confident even with what seems to be a big buildup from '22 to '23. You just have to pay attention to the momentum we have as we exit the full year '22 into '23. No different than that '19 to '20 discussion that we had. It seems like yesterday, but it was 3 years ago."

So first off, our customers have to invest ahead of their project load in order to be successful. Remember, our tools show up not only in the execution phase and the make phase, but also very early in the early conceptual design phases. And one of the big areas of strength that we saw in Q4 was that large increase in enterprise business agreements we see. The record number of EBAs we saw is kind of emblematic of customers investing in future digitization capacity. So we expect to see that regardless of the situation in the markets right now.
But our view continues to be Q1 is the trough. The acceleration starts to come out of Q1 as we head out of the spring and into the summer. Now right now, there's lots of uncertainty, and you hear lots of buzz around variants and vaccine distributions. But I think all of us are smart enough to know that just like when we had these discussions about testing infrastructure and testing rollout and testing capacity, all these things work themselves out over a multi-month period in terms of distribution of vaccines, distribution of assignment of capacity and all the things associated with that. 
Now if all of that stuff starts to crumble and fumble, of course, you end up in a new situation. But you know what, that is highly unlikely in this situation. And there's much more alignment on trying to get the right things done. And that's what we're hearing from our customers more and more is they're trying to invest ahead of the growth they see coming forward. So we're pretty bullish as we head into the second half of the year. And we're pretty optimistic as we head into the summer. There's always something that can derail this, a wobble in the vaccine distribution or something associated with that or some kind of rise of political uncertainty. But you know what, we can't predict those things, and we don't see those things. What we see mostly are tailwinds right now as we head out of Q1 and into Q2 and beyond."

But make no bones about it, our organic investment is very much driven on this convergence of design and make in both AEC and manufacturing and on this conversion -- this convergence of manufacturing and construction across our industries. We've got a lot of organic focus in the innovation in those areas. We will acquire inorganically for innovation in certain cloud-based areas. But more likely than not, we'll acquire for vertical specialization in areas where established businesses have created a presence. I think Innovyze is indicative of that. Sorry."

I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy.
Before jumping into our fourth quarter and full year results, I would like to again thank our employees and the families and communities that support them as well as our partners and customers for their continued commitment during uncertain times. That commitment, combined with our resilient subscription business model and the secular shift to the cloud, enabled us to maintain momentum and exceed our goals.
We generated strong growth with full year subscription revenue and remaining performance obligations, or RPO, up 26% and 19%, respectively. We also made significant progress towards digitizing AEC, converging design and make in manufacturing and converting noncompliant and legacy users. We signed a record number of new Enterprise Business Agreements, or EBAs, in the fourth quarter. In fact, they were equal to the number we signed in the entirety of the previous year. That's a testament both to our execution and growing partnership with our enterprise customers as we enable their digital transformations, demonstrated by enterprise BIM 360 usage nearly doubling year-over-year. While we made great strides this year, we intend to extend our leadership in the cloud and expand our presence in existing and adjacent industry verticals across the globe. 
The pending acquisition of Innovyze, which we announced yesterday and is expected to close later this quarter, is a great example of that intent. Innovyze is a global leader in water infrastructure simulation and modeling, serving many of the world's largest utilities, the majority of the top ENR design firms and other leading environmental and engineering consultancies. Innovyze enables water distribution networks and drainage systems to be more cost effectively and sustainably designed and operated. Combined with CIVIL 3D, InfraWorks, Revit and Autodesk Construction Cloud, we would be able to provide end-to-end water and wastewater solutions across planning, design, construction and operations. 
With our existing capabilities in road and rail and our partnership with Aurigo in capital planning, we now have end-to-end infrastructure solutions for facilities owners and public sector agencies. Autodesk provides Innovyze with multiple opportunities to scale through enterprise, channel sales and geographic expansion. We also intend to apply our expertise in navigating through a business model transition to drive additional growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to the future with optimism. 
In the near term, we expect the unwinding of uncertainty from vaccine availability and political stability to drive confidence and investment over the second half of the year. Over the long term, Autodesk's purpose to drive efficiency and sustainability has never been more relevant or urgent. 
In partnership with our customers, we have an unmatched capacity to drive efficiency and meet the global challenges of carbon emissions, embedded carbon, water scarcity and waste. And Autodesk is playing its part. We are on track to meet our commitment to be climate neutral and remain dedicated to being a resilient, diverse and equitable company. We were most recently recognized by Barron's as #4 on their list of World's 100 Most Sustainable Companies and the highest ranked software company. We are proud of our impact at Autodesk, and through our customers, the impact we are making in the wider world. 
I'm also thrilled to announce 2 strong additions to my team. Debbie Clifford will be returning to Autodesk as Chief Financial Officer; and Raji Arasu will be joining as Chief Technology Officer. Debbie is currently Chief Financial Officer at SurveyMonkey, but spent the 13 years prior to that role in various financial leadership roles at Autodesk, including leading the internal business model transition team, engaging with many of you in support of our investor outreach and as my finance business partner before I became CEO. With her leadership skills, expertise and passion for our mission, Autodesk finance team will not miss a beat. 
Raji joins us from Intuit, where she currently serves as Senior Vice President of their Platform and Services business. Prior to that, she was CTO for eBay subsidiary StubHub. At Autodesk, she will oversee and be responsible to the Autodesk technology and platform strategy as well as being operationally responsible for the ongoing development of our platform services. Raji will replace current Autodesk CTO, Scott Borduin, who announced his intent to retire last year after more than 21 years of service to the company. Scott had 2 tours as Autodesk CEO, the prior one working for Carol Bartz, and has not only contributed to the rise of Inventor and Fusion to the products they are today, but also as a passionate evangelist for Autodesk and our vision. Emblematic of his dedication to Autodesk, he moved out his retirement date so that he can help Raji during her transition into Autodesk. I'd like to give Scott a heartfelt thank you for all he's done and is continuing to do.
Before I provide insight into our strategic growth drivers, let me take you through the details of our quarterly and full year performance and the guidance for the next year. In an extraordinary year, we performed strongly across all metrics, perhaps best encapsulated by the sum of our revenue growth and free cash flow margin for the year equaling 51%.  Several factors contributed to that strength in the fourth quarter, including record EBAs, robust subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales and continued sequential growth in new business. 
Total revenue growth in the quarter was 16%, both as reported and in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 22% and now representing approximately 91% of total revenue. There was approximately 2 percentage points of benefit to subscription and maintenance growth from upfront revenue recognition of some products that do not incorporate substantial cloud services.
Looking at revenue by product and geography. AutoCAD and LT (sic) [ AutoCAD LT ] revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the year. AEC grew 18% in Q4 and 20% for the year. Manufacturing rose 17% in Q4 and 10% for the year, even excluding the benefit from a strong performance in automotive EBAs which include nonratable VRED revenue, Manufacturing grew double digits in the quarter. M&E grew 14% in the quarter, boosted by a strong performance from our collaboration platform Shotgun and was up 10% for the year. Geographically, revenue growth ticked up in all regions. Revenue grew 14% in the Americas, 13% in EMEA and 23% in APAC during the quarter. 
We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 28% versus last year and represented 34% of our total sales, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter of last year. The strength in our direct business was driven by some nonratable products included in a few large EBAs and digital sales. 
During the year, we grew total subscriptions by 8% to $5.3 million. Excluding the multiuser trade-in program, total subscriptions grew 4% to $5.1 million. Subscription plan subscriptions grew 15% and by 10%, excluding the multi-user trade-in program. We added 130,000 main subscriptions due to the strong adoption of our BIM 360 family and Fusion 360 products.
During Q4, our maintenance, conversion and renewal rates declined sequentially, which was expected as we are entering the final stages of our maintenance to subscription program. With only 1 quarter left before this program retires, we have approximately 126,000 maintenance subscriptions remaining, accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. I am proud to share that we have converted over 1.3 million maintenance subscriptions to date. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, the lion's share of our commercial subscriptions were named users benefiting from easier access, usage data visibility and secure license management. We anticipate many of our remaining multi-user subscribers will make the transition to named users as the pandemic recedes. And we are now extending our 2:1 multi-user trade-in to August 2023 to enable that. 
As announced last November, we are also exploring consumption-based models to meet the needs of customers requiring flexible license usage. Our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100 to 110 percentage range we laid out in our guidance. Our product subscription renewal rates remain robust, reinforcing the business-critical nature of our products to our customers. 
Our billings were broadly level with last year, reflecting fewer multiyear sales, and our long-term deferred revenue was 26% of total deferred revenue in Q4. Our total RPO of $4.2 billion is up 19%, and our current RPO of $2.7 billion grew 16%. 
On margins, we continue to realize good operating leverage due to strong revenue growth and diligent expense management. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margins remained very strong at 93%, up 1 percentage point from last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 29%.
As you have seen in our press release, our GAAP results include a $679 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance released in the fourth quarter. This largely reflects the completion of our business model transition and the significant growth in our profitability. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurpose shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 530,000 shares for $157 million at an average price of approximately $295 per share. For the full year, we purchased 2.6 million shares for $549 million at an average price of approximately $208 per share. 
Now let me turn to our guidance, which does not include Innovyze. We expect an improving macroeconomic environment during the year will result in accelerating growth in new business over the course of fiscal 2022. Usage trends during the fourth quarter remained above pre-COVID levels in most of Asia Pacific and Continental Europe and below pre-COVID levels in the U.S. and U.K. 
We have seen an uptick in interest from multiyear deals, growing optimism in the channel and gradual recovery in bid activity on BuildingConnected in the U.S. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be very healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. 
Given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. For fiscal 2022, we expect revenue to grow by 13% to 15%, margins to expand to between 31% and 32% and free cash flow growth to reaccelerate to approximately 20%. When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal 2022, we expect about 3/4 of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our macroeconomic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. 
As we noted last quarter, Vault revenue is becoming ratable for fiscal 2022 with the release of significant new mobile fee functionality in the first quarter. And this will reduce our revenue growth by about 1 percentage point over the year, with the biggest impact in our revenue on the P&L and in the manufacturing product family. 
Looking at our guidance for the first quarter. Normal seasonality is compounded by Vault ratability and one fewer calendar day versus Q1 fiscal 2021, which together reduces year-on-year revenue growth in the first quarter by about 2 percentage points. With improving macroeconomic conditions and easing comparables, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate after the first quarter. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for fiscal first quarter and full year 2022. 
We expect Innovyze to be accretive to revenue growth, broadly neutral to free cash flow and a headwind on reported operating margins in fiscal 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details after the Innovyze transaction completes. 
Let me finish by giving you some details on the progress we made executing on our strategy to digitize AEC, converge design and make in manufacturing and monetize noncompliant and legacy users. Early in February, we launched our Autodesk Construction Cloud platform, which unifies our organic and acquired AEC cloud offerings and the data held within them to enable a connected project ecosystem across design and construction. 
Underpinning the Autodesk Construction Cloud is our common data environment, Autodesk Docs. This provides seamless navigation, integrated workflows and project controls and enables a single source of truth across the project life cycle. Autodesk Build brings together the best of PlanGrid and BIM 360 with new functionality, which along with Autodesk Quantify and BIM Collaborate, creates a comprehensive suite of field construction and project management solutions. 
For our design customers, BIM Collaborate Pro extends the capabilities of BIM 360 design on the new platform to create a more seamless exchange of project data between design and construction. Our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. We have pursued that strategy to create Autodesk Construction Cloud, we are pursuing that strategy and infrastructure with the acquisition of Innovyze and we will continue to pursue that strategy in manufacturing. 
The reasons for and the benefits of this strategy were clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Our growing partnership with our enterprise customers, as we enable their digital transformations, resulted both in record number of EBAs in the fourth quarter and also strong expansion in renewal rates with existing EBA customers. 
We are seeing our new products, typically used by contractors, being increasingly adopted by design firms. For example, we expanded our agreement with Jacobs, the world's largest design firm to include Pipe, PlanGrid and Assemble to enable greater collaboration and more efficient workflows. Autodesk has been a trusted partner of Jacobs over the last 30 years, aligned with its mission to challenge today and reinvent tomorrow. Jacobs is also using Autodesk's transformative services to help them deliver innovative solutions to their customers. For example, Autodesk and Jacobs partnered to deliver the world's first generatively designed airport in Australia. And together, we are focused on leveraging Generative Design to solve their other client challenges around the world. 
Environmental Air Systems, EAS, a full-service mechanical contractor and custom-built HVAC equipment manufacturer, which is on the forefront of industrialized construction, increased its investment with Autodesk by replacing its existing project management tool with BIM 360. It is now able to leverage its existing investment in AEC collections and provide a comprehensive tool for its teams to collaborate and to connect the office and the field. 
And Tyréns, a leading sustainable urban development consultancy in Sweden, significantly expanded its strategic platform partnership with Autodesk. As Per Bjälnes, Tyréns' Digital Strategy Manager for Business Area X said, ""Tyréns is at the leading edge of the digital transformation of the construction and maintenance industry. Digitization enables smart buildings design that requires secure data flows and seamless collaboration across a broad ecosystem of stakeholders during the construction and operations process. Autodesk's Revit and BIM 360 Docs empowered us to create true digital representations. And now with Autodesk Forge, we can leverage those assets as digital twins to create value for different stakeholders such as a reduction of energy consumption, the prediction and optimization of maintenance and new smart, seamless end user services.""
We are also seeing benefits from our strategy in manufacturing. In the automotive sector, we provide design software through our enterprise business agreements to nearly all of the largest automotive OEMs and are extending our footprint beyond design into the factory. For example, our expanded partnership with Rivian, a global provider of electric adventure vehicles, now extends across facilities with Revit, BIM 360 and PlanGrid, manufacturing with Inventor and Generative Design and in the design studio with Alias, VRED and Shotgun. We are able to support Rivian as it converts existing facilities to digital twins, optimizes its factory layout using Generative Design, improves energy efficiency through simulation and enables collaboration and efficiency using a common data environment.
Similarly, we are providing end-to-end support to our long-term customer, Transmashholding, TMH, which is the largest manufacturing of rolling stock and rail equipment in Russia and CIS, to accelerate its digital transformation and converge its design and make processes. TMH now builds trains in concept in Alias, designs and engineers in Inventor, optimizes in Fusion, produces and PowerMill and sells in VRED.
Our market-leading cloud-based platform, Fusion 360, enjoyed another quarter of accelerating subscriptions, growing scale of deployments and adding competitive displacements, ending the quarter with over 140,000 commercial subscriptions. Conturo Prototyping, a machine shop based in Pittsburgh, recently expanded its relationship with Autodesk by adding more Fusion seats. Conturo is also adopting our recently launched machining extension due to its integrated design and CAM work flows, its advanced manufacturing capability and the potential of Generative Design to reduce project time lines and solve design for manufacturing issues faster than ever before.
In education, we continue to expand our footprint and replace traditional CAD competitors. With Tinkercad and Fusion alone, Autodesk is now approaching 40 million education users worldwide. For example, all of University College London's mechanical engineers switched to Fusion 360 during the fourth quarter. As Professor Tim Baker, MBE, who led the transition said, ""COVID-19 accelerated UCL's transition to the cloud. By enabling collaborative, multidisciplinary engineering, Fusion 360's next-generation platform equips our graduates to become the world's leading engineers of the future. While all our software remains free for educators and students, graduates continue to bring Fusion 360 with them into the workplace, from startups through to the giants of manufacturing."" 
While we have moderated our license compliance activity during the pandemic, we continue to work with existing and potential customers to ensure they pay for the software they use and comply with our terms of use. Our goal remains to give noncompliant and legacy users access to the benefits of subscription access through flexible models. During the quarter, we closed 23 deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, 3 of which were over $1 million.
For example, our European customer became aware during its transition to named users that its employees were accessing licenses in regions outside of the contract scope. Our premium plan provided them with the flexibility to manage all licenses centrally, monitor usage to remaining compliance and resulted in $1 million-plus deal. And a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions based in Europe, who became a legacy customer 3 years ago, subscribed to our product design and manufacturing collection when we were able to demonstrate that recent workflow improvements and cloud-enabled functionality would allow them to win more business by improving communication with their own customers and improve efficiency through quicker layout in 2D and hand over to 3D in visualization. 
In closing, we continue to build a stronger Autodesk for the long term. Our early and sustained organic and strategic investment in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, combined with a successful transition to a SaaS business model, give us significant competitive advantages and confidence to grow in the double-digit range in the foreseeable future. We expect to have accelerating momentum during fiscal 2022, and we have multiple drivers that make us confident in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion and double-digit growth thereafter. 
With that, operator, we would like to now open the call up for questions."

And that has a disproportionate impact on how we see revenue in Q1. But the way we look at it shaping up this year is Q1 is kind of the trough of the new business recovery, and we're going to be accelerating our new business growth out through the year into the second half of the year. In fact, we really see a world where most of the new business that didn't show up last year kind of reemerges as we head through this year. So it's important to see that, that business that disappeared last year didn't disappear. It just got shifted out. In fact, you're hearing a lot about the acceleration of digitization in multiple industries, and we're seeing that in our space in spades as well. 
And I think if we look at particular sectors, it's actually really going to be distributed across all the sectors in kind of similar ways. AEC is already investing really significantly ahead of the market in terms of their digitization efforts. You kind of saw early evidence of that with the EBA business we did, the record number of EBAs we did in Q4 relative to previous years. In manufacturing, you kind of see the same accelerated interest in digitization and new cloud-based workflows, especially surrounding what we're seeing in Fusion. The same goes in media and entertainment. The media and entertainment business, which was classically a laggard on some of these highly digital, highly cloud integrated workflows, is moving to the cloud in a big way. 
Now geographically, kind of in a broad brush, I kind of highlighted in the opening remarks that we saw a broad recovery in Europe and Asia to pre-COVID levels of monthly active usage. And we saw a little bit of a lag in the U.S. and the U.K. I think we're going to see that kind of geographic return of new business in that cascade. It's going to be strong in APAC, it's going to get strong in Europe and then it's going to start to come back in the U.S. and the U.K. Q1 will be the trough of this new business growth, and we're going to accelerate right out of that into the rest of the year."

So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projects",532,"Yes. Difference is an opportunity, Saket. So first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did Innovyze. I think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long term. Infrastructure projects take a long time to design and plan, and they last even longer after that. So an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the long-term health of Autodesk. And I think we just have to be super clear about that. 
Water was one of those areas where it would have taken us a lot of time to catch up organically. Whereas road and rail is an area we've been highlighting to you that we've been investing in organically with our portfolio and really making great strides there.
When you look at the business at a high level in terms of the differences and where the revenue is going to come from. So look, at a high level, Innovyze is going to be accretive to our revenue growth, roughly to 1 percentage point as we head into this year. And that includes deferred revenue write-offs and the fact that we have a partial year in here. It's probably going to be dilutive this year, about 1 percentage point off of operating margin. 
But here's the opportunity that I want to make sure you highlight, and you actually poked on a little bit between the differences in our business model. Not only are we going to plug Innovyze into our sales engines in terms of named accounts, channel sales and international expansion, we're also going to apply our expertise on business model transformation to the Innovyze product portfolio. And I think that's going to be an important transitional element of how we absorb Innovyze into the company. We're good at this, we know how to do this and we know how to navigate this. So what you're going to see in FY '23 is you'll probably see a little bit of a depression of Innovyze's revenue growth in isolation because we're going to be applying the business model transformation. And as you know, with the business model transformation, there's downward pressure in revenue as a result, but acceleration of revenue as you head out onto the other side of the business model transformation. 
So if we look at FY '23, it's probably going to be neutral to the overall revenue growth of the company. It's not going to touch the free cash flow number, $2.4 billion is going to come out, Innovyze or no Innovyze. And there'll probably be a little bit more of a headwind to operating margin, maybe between 1% and 2% as we go through the business model transformation, but a nice acceleration up to our double-digit growth standards as we head beyond FY '23 to '24, '25 and '26, which is kind of an extra bonus on top of what we're going to be able to do just to expand the core Innovyze water business to capitalize on the increasing investment in infrastructure. So it's a good question to talk about the differences in our business model because there's actually an opportunity there and a difference."

119902,702894090,2293022,"Autodesk, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So we actually started to see the early signs of that as we headed into Q4 as new business started to strengthen in our construction portfolio in particular.

So we actually started to see the early signs of that as we headed into Q4 as new business started to strengthen in our construction portfolio in particular. And we also saw it across the Fusion base as well as people started to look at their manufacturing and the design-to-manufacturing operations. So we see a pretty significant opportunity here. And look, in many ways, the pandemic gave us an opportunity to catch up and pull ahead a little bit here. Our portfolio is now best-in-class. Our development team did an incredible heavy lift and an amazing job unifying what was the best of PlanGrid, which was the best of what we had in BIM 360. We now have Autodesk Build on this foundation of Autodesk Docs. And there is no one that has a better office-to-trailer solution than we do. 
And I think if you go out there and you talk to customers and you talk to the space and they look at what we've done with Autodesk Build, you're going to hear the same kind of feedback that we really built a great product. And that's the product we're going to be leading with on new business. It's not that we won't be leading on the acquired portfolio products as we continue to sell those. But we're going to lead with Build, and we're going to lead with Build in many places. And that's going to give us a chance to not only drive a successful international expansion, but also continue to lap some of our competitors in the rest of the market, especially in places like the mid-market. 
But another one of the pieces of our secret sauce heading into the year, Phil, is the flexibility we offer on business models. We meet our customers wherever they are. And I think this is super important for you to pay attention to. We sell named user subscription. We sell site licenses. We sell project-based licensing when they want it. We sell consumption inside of EBAs. Whatever they need for whatever project they're pursuing, we have a model for them and a product for them. And I think that important convergence between the flexibility, which, by the way, costs us complexity in the back end, but it's worth it in terms of meeting the customers where they are. 
When you combine that with the products, we feel really, really optimistic about how we're going to accelerate in this year and meet some of this demand. And our customers are looking for it. They want to digitize faster. They're starting to increase their spending. And we think we've got the portfolio of products and the portfolio of purchasing options that makes it work. We're not trying to force people into one kind of business model and then maybe try to lock them in, in kind of places that they don't want to be. So we feel pretty optimistic."

For instance, in terms of channel, in terms of delivering on the platform, going live perhaps with PPU, other critical technical milestones that you might care to talk about in terms of new products like Tandem and Spacemaker and so forth.
And then secondly, on the last call, you noted that within your peer group, Autodesk is the largest R&D spender, which is the case. But could you talk in a little bit more detail about how you're allocating R&D? Maybe talk about the priorities. You've spoken of reinvesting in the A of AEC. And maybe talk about some of those critical investment priorities vis-à-vis R&D."

So there -- that was a -- it's usually a multipart question from Jay. All right. So let's talk about some of the programmatic pieces here. Now I don't want to take any thunder away from this year's AU, which is where we talk a lot about. A",662,"Yes. All right. So there -- that was a -- it's usually a multipart question from Jay. All right. So let's talk about some of the programmatic pieces here. Now I don't want to take any thunder away from this year's AU, which is where we talk a lot about. As you probably noticed with last AU, you're going to see more of a product announcement focused AU as we move forward. So I don't want to take any thunder away from that. 
But if you look at programmatically where we're going to be leaning into, platform enhancements that bring design and make in the industries together and create commonality across many of the industries we serve are going to be a particular lever that we're going to be moving with. We just hired a new CTO with a lot of platform strategy chops that we're going to be leveraging to integrate some deeper platform capabilities into the company. 
We're also going to be looking programmatically at the named user transition program. As you know, that was kind of a bumpy program last year. Customers really didn't appreciate us introducing that into a pandemic year. And they really want to understand what their options are with regards to flexible usage and occasional use moving forward. So look for us to explore those kind of capabilities as we've extended out what the deadline was in that program, which still makes that program being executed faster than maintenance and subscription, but probably more on a time line that fits with what our customers can absorb. So you'll see us kind of look at those flexible options and explore some of those things with our customers.
Now if you look specifically at how we're allocating investment. I mean I think you saw what we did around the A in AEC. We acquired Spacemaker. We're integrating that team, building up capabilities around that team, particularly around integrating machine learning and cloud-based platforms into the design process in architecture and engineering. So that investment is clear. We've highlighted it. You've just seen how we're investing in infrastructure and civil infrastructure. We already talked organically about road and rail, and now we've also talked about water. And all of this kind of builds on top of what we're doing with Construction Cloud. 
I haven't talked a lot about what we're going to be doing with manufacturing, but here's what I can tell you. We're very interested in the cloud transformation in manufacturing. And I think you'll see us lean deeply into the cloud transformation around manufacturing more. We've invested pretty heavily there. Our investment is large in that whole portfolio, particularly in the Fusion portfolio. I think you'll continue to see us to invest in that area. And as we head towards AU, you'll hear exciting things about Fusion. You'll hear exciting things about Tandem. You'll hear exciting things about the platform for the company. And you'll hear exciting things about how the AEC portfolio is starting to come together in a similar way that we brought together some of the construction portfolio acquisitions that we did previously. So look for us to kind of play across all those fields. 
Now in terms of the breadth of what we're doing, I think I might have talked about this last time. We reverticalized the company just recently in October. So now I have someone that's responsible for the AEC execution again. That's Amy Bunszel. Scott Reese working on the execution in product design and manufacturing. And Diana Colella working in the media and entertainment space. And they are working closely with me and the rest of the team to execute on these vertical priorities, while we've also elevated platform up to an executive staff level, reporting directly to me, which will allow us to synergize the platform efforts more tightly with those things. So we're doing this from an operational perspective as well as from a strategic investment perspective."

I think what you saw last year, and I think this is a natural thing, like there's 2 sides of the bell curve, right? There's the size of the bell curve for which 2:1 is like, hey, that's a no-brainer for me, I'm going to take the 2:1. And there's a side of the bell curve for which 2:1 requires some more thought by the customer, more thought about, ""Okay, wait a second, my usage is greater than 2:1. Autodesk, what are you going to do to allow me to flex a little bit more? And EBA is too big for me.""
So what you saw early on is a lot of those people on the left side of the bell curve, the 50% of people that were up for renewal last year that said, ""Hey, this is good for me."" They moved quite rapidly through that, all right? The extension is for the people that require more thought about how this is going to impact their business and how they're going to adapt if their usage is greater than the 2:1 that the program had. 
So that's one of the reasons why we're working on the extension. Also to making sure that we have the new flexible models out there for them to explore. So there's no change in our expectations with regards to the impact on our business. It's going to be over, the whole period of the program, neutral in terms of impact to our business.

But if we look at where we want to be, it's just a reversion back to the mean. And remember that the multiyear business is attractive to both our channel partners and our customers because our channel partners like to collect the cash upfront. And our customers like to lock in the price protection for multiple years.

So we've -- we're hitting the ranges that we've set for net revenue retention. And frankly, there's -- obviously, there's 2 things that drive net revenue retention, renewal rates and -- the AOB renewal and the ability to expand into accounts, right?",232,"Yes. So we've -- we're hitting the ranges that we've set for net revenue retention. And frankly, there's -- obviously, there's 2 things that drive net revenue retention, renewal rates and -- the AOB renewal and the ability to expand into accounts, right? And so we're working both of those sides in terms of increasing renewal rates and increasing our ability to expand in accounts with the make solutions. So when we look at net revenue retention, we -- so remember, one of the things we saw, and I think we highlighted this a lot over the last year, was how strong the renewal rates lasted throughout the -- through the last year, and how we continue to move forward. So we actually overperformed based on our expectations on renewal rates of the business. We continue to see -- we continue to expect that to accelerate.
But more importantly, the net revenue retention is going to be driven by more and more people incorporating our digital portfolios, Construction Cloud, Fusion, other types of products like that, and also moving to BIM in the AEC space. So look for a lot of the increases in net revenue retention to be programmatically driven by the move to BIM, the move to digitizing the cloud -- in Construction Cloud and the move to transform their manufacturing processes with Fusion 360 and other solutions like that."

So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1. So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite ra",510,"Yes. So this is a really important question. So let's talk about Q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in Q1. So I think I said earlier, Q1 is actually the trough of where we expect things to be. We're going to accelerate quite rapidly out of Q1, but what actually drives the revenue guide in Q1? The most important thing is the revenue recognition. 
So let's look at last year. Last year, we did not grow new business to the degree we expected to. In fact, we saw a decline year-over-year in our new business. The impact of those declines in new business bookings in the previous year have a disproportionately large effect on Q1. But they work themselves out relatively quickly as you move into Q2, Q3, Q4 and beyond. So we absolutely do have a somewhat more back-end loaded year than we would in a classic Autodesk year. But not extremely to the degree, simply because of the hole that was created. 
And I think I said earlier, the new business that we lost last year didn't disappear. It's coming back. And it's coming back with a vengeance as we head into next year. But there's a couple of other little factors that affect Q1 disproportionately. And I think it's really important that we all get grounded on some of these things.
So the first one is we have a set of products that, because they are not yet cloud-enabled to a certain degree, are recognized upfront in the revenue in the accounting rules. They have to be. We have been working hard to ensure that all of those products are cloud-enabled, and that will actually force them to be recognized ratably.
One of the products that is moving from upfront recognition to ratable recognition is the Vault product family. And that Vault product family was providing quite a bit of upfront revenue recognition previously. And now as we enter Q1, it's all going to be recognized ratably because Vault now has a mobile client, it now has other cloud-enabled features in it. So that was all of a sudden, a headwind to revenue recognition in Q1, but it works itself out as the year progresses, as the ratability progresses and the buildup progresses. And this is just the way a subscription business model works. So there's some unusual sort of onetime headwinds to Q1 that unwind themselves fairly quickly. And Q1 is the trough, and we will accelerate out of there. But it's definitely related to the buildup of recognized revenue as we progress. So that -- I hope that helps you understand a little bit more how Q1 works. 
And yes, there are some additional little details like Q1 is 1 day shorter this year, year-over-year. So it's actually one less day of revenue in the quarter. And it's 3 days shorter than quarter-over-quarter. But those other things I talked about are much more important for understanding the Q1 guide and how it unwinds as the year progresses. Makes sense?"

And how do those similarities or differences impact Autodesk, just given how your product portfolio has changed?"

So remember, first off that we are distributed across almost all facets of the industry, and it's important to realize that when one wobbles, another one pops up. So -- and we're absolutely seeing that pattern. So for instance, you see in commercial real estate development, you see a slowing of projects. You actually do see a rebooting of projects that have been put on hold by the pandemic. But you see a slowing of new projects, but you see other new projects coming in the pipeline in terms of urban multifamily housing, suburban multifamily housing, other types of commercial real estate outside of dense urban areas, right? So we're hearing a lot from customers about a shift in where their portfolios are moving to. 
One thing we are getting consistently though is an ongoing focus on adopting certain aspects of our cloud portfolio, particularly what we do with Autodesk Build collaboration, the collaboration tools for Revit models. We're seeing a lot of increased adoption in that. We saw a lot of strength last year. We're seeing some of that strength heading in. I think that's going to be an important part of our portfolio moving forward because not only does it allow for seamless remote work, but it also allows for better downstream integration to the rest of the build process. So we're seeing a lot of those tools being adopted, and we're also seeing a lot more adoption of some of the cloud-based tools that we're seeing in manufacturing. 
So the cloud is definitely front and center in terms of some of the growth areas in our portfolio. But do not underestimate BIM and the role of Revit in the digitization of AEC. It will continue to be a strong driver in the new world order. But it's uneven. It cuts very -- across geographies, across segments. You definitely see differences in terms of where people are going seeing things booting up and where they see things slowing down. But like every cycle we've ever seen, the money just shifts to somewhere else."

So first off, I want to make sure that I just reiterate something I've said many times before. We model our business with super high fidelity, okay? And within those models, we never put forward our best case, all right? We always had a buffer in there at some degree. Buffers are great for like pandemic years. You got -- you love it when you have a buffer.
Now of course, as you get closer to events like FY '23 and things like associated with that, the buffer gets smaller, but so does -- but the accuracy of your model also gets better as well, right? So we have super -- we have a lot of confidence in the buildup to FY '23, the $2.4 billion in free cash flow, the organic metrics surrounding our business. And we also have a lot of confidence in the double-digit growth as we head beyond fiscal '23. Fiscal '23 isn't some event. It's just another milepost like fiscal '20 was, fiscal '23 is. It's another milepost on a journey but there is ongoing growth in the double-digit range out beyond fiscal '23. 
Now I think one of the things people anchor on right now is what about this buildup from '22 to '23? One of the things I want to remind you is about the nature of how momentum is going to be exiting '22. Remember, we're slight -- we're going to be slightly more back-end loaded in terms of the accumulation of revenue and new business heading into fiscal '23, not dramatically back-end loaded, but more back-end loaded than we would traditionally be. We're going to exit '23 with quite a bit more momentum than the full year targets would indicate, all right, relatively speaking, in terms of those outcomes. 
So we feel pretty confident with the momentum we'll exit FY '23 with and that we have the book of business from the renewal base, from the continuing digitization of AEC, from the continuing convergence of design and make in manufacturing and to the conversion of noncompliant users to hit the numbers that we have in FY '23 and beyond. And we're confident in our models. We're confident in the margin of error. We're confident in the levers we can pull, if we had to pull any. So we see line of sight to some of the organic goals that we've been talking about. And we continue to be confident even with what seems to be a big buildup from '22 to '23. You just have to pay attention to the momentum we have as we exit the full year '22 into '23. No different than that '19 to '20 discussion that we had. It seems like yesterday, but it was 3 years ago."

So first off, our customers have to invest ahead of their project load in order to be successful. Remember, our tools show up not only in the execution phase and the make phase, but also very early in the early conceptual design phases. And one of the big areas of strength that we saw in Q4 was that large increase in enterprise business agreements we see. The record number of EBAs we saw is kind of emblematic of customers investing in future digitization capacity. So we expect to see that regardless of the situation in the markets right now.
But our view continues to be Q1 is the trough. The acceleration starts to come out of Q1 as we head out of the spring and into the summer. Now right now, there's lots of uncertainty, and you hear lots of buzz around variants and vaccine distributions. But I think all of us are smart enough to know that just like when we had these discussions about testing infrastructure and testing rollout and testing capacity, all these things work themselves out over a multi-month period in terms of distribution of vaccines, distribution of assignment of capacity and all the things associated with that. 
Now if all of that stuff starts to crumble and fumble, of course, you end up in a new situation. But you know what, that is highly unlikely in this situation. And there's much more alignment on trying to get the right things done. And that's what we're hearing from our customers more and more is they're trying to invest ahead of the growth they see coming forward. So we're pretty bullish as we head into the second half of the year. And we're pretty optimistic as we head into the summer. There's always something that can derail this, a wobble in the vaccine distribution or something associated with that or some kind of rise of political uncertainty. But you know what, we can't predict those things, and we don't see those things. What we see mostly are tailwinds right now as we head out of Q1 and into Q2 and beyond."

But make no bones about it, our organic investment is very much driven on this convergence of design and make in both AEC and manufacturing and on this conversion -- this convergence of manufacturing and construction across our industries. We've got a lot of organic focus in the innovation in those areas. We will acquire inorganically for innovation in certain cloud-based areas. But more likely than not, we'll acquire for vertical specialization in areas where established businesses have created a presence. I think Innovyze is indicative of that. Sorry."

Our first quarter marks an important inflection point. While solid execution, a resilient subscription business model and continued secular shift to the cloud underpinned our strong first quarter results, weighing uncertainty and growing confidence in our end markets generated momentum. Robust growth in new product subscriptions, combined with improving usage and renewal rates, accelerated billings and RPO growth to 10% and 22%, respectively. Together, these reinforce our confidence that we are through the revenue growth trough and on track to achieve our fiscal '22 and '23 goals. 
In mid-May, we completed the acquisition of Upchain, a cloud-native product data and life cycle management solution. Combined with existing audits offerings like Fusion 360, Upchain will profoundly simplify data sharing and collaboration for engineers manufacturers, suppliers and other product stakeholders, enabling customers to bring products to market faster and build a stronger supply chain. Its next-generation platform enables it to be rapidly deployed, scaled, maintained and updated without the expensive inflexible and time-consuming integrations of legacy systems. 
We will grow Upchain through our enterprise and channel partnerships and expect it to become a meaningful on-ramp for legacy design tools to the Fusion 360 cloud ecosystem and facilitate further expansion into adjacent verticals. 
As we highlighted in our recently published Impact Report, the convergence of design and make brings both greater efficiency and sustainability to buildings in a broad range of manufactured goods, stretching from EVs and bicycles to high-performance skis and low-cost ventilators. While we are enabling customers to achieve their sustainability targets, we continue to lead by example, reaching our carbon-neutral goal across our business and value chain in fiscal '21. 
The report also sets out new diversity, equity and inclusion goals. And while I'm proud that 50% of Autodesk Board and 45% of our executive team are women, we can and will do more both internally and through partnerships with organizations like IFF Labs externally. 
As we recently announced, Pascal Di Fronzo, Autodesk's Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, will be retiring in December after 23 very successful years at the company. He has been a trusted counselor and steward of the company. His contributions to Autodesk are many and have been incredibly impactful, and I want to thank him for his dedication and wish him all the best in retirement. 
I am very excited to welcome Debbie back to Autodesk, and will now turn the call over to her to take you through the details of our quarterly results and guidance for the year. I will then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives."

Looking at revenue by product and geography, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew by 9%. AEC revenue grew 16% and manufacturing revenue grew 8%. Excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, which we discussed last quarter, manufacturing revenue grew double digits. M&E revenue grew 5%. Across the globe, revenue grew 8% in the Americas, 11% in EMEA and 20% in APAC. Direct revenue increased 25% and represented 33% of our total revenue, up from 30% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. Our e-commerce sites had their highest new billings growth rate in 2 years, driven by strong traffic growth and recent site enhancements. 
Reflecting the business-critical nature of our products to our customers, our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range, and our product subscription renewal rates strengthened. 
Our billings accelerated 10% to $974 million. Total deferred revenue grew 11% to $3.35 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting growth in new product subscriptions and increasing renewal rates, but also the inclusion of Innovyze. This was partly offset by a smaller contribution from long-term deferred revenue, resulting from fewer multiyear contracts when compared to last year. 
Total RPO of $4.23 billion and current RPO of $2.86 billion both grew 22%. Current RPO growth was primarily driven by the increase in short-term deferred revenue, but also by strong growth in enterprise business agreements and to a lesser extent, early renewals ahead of anticipated price increases. Excluding the contribution from early renewals and Innovyze, current RPO grew approximately 20%. 
Non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin remained strong at 92% and 28%, respectively, broadly level year-over-year and reflecting the trough and revenue growth relative to cost growth. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $316 million during the quarter, driven by collections of prior quarter billings and strong results in the current quarter. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. 
During the first quarter, we purchased 515,000 shares for $143 million at an average price of approximately $277 per share. 
Now I'll shift to giving you my initial thoughts as CFO and then finish with our outlook. Since I rejoined Autodesk about 2 months ago, I've been focused on 2 things: first, reacquainting myself with everything Autodesk, the team, our strategy and how we've evolved during my 2 years away; and second, I've been digging deep to gain a solid understanding of our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals. 
On the first point, while much at Autodesk is familiar to me, I've been pleasantly surprised by how much has changed for the better, reflecting the enormous progress Autodesk has made over the last 2 years. Autodesk has undergone a cultural revolution. There's been a powerful shift in the company's values and ways we work, and the pace of decision-making has accelerated. 
As a company, we now benefit not only from the scale of our operation, but also from a new found agility that is enabling our success in newer markets like construction and manufacturing in the cloud. I'm also struck by the compelling and expanding opportunities ahead of us. Digital transformation is happening now, it is real, and we are well positioned to capitalize on that trend in the industries we serve. As I begin to turn my attention to our long-range financial plan, these initial learnings give me confidence in our growth potential in fiscal '24 and beyond. 
Let me finish with our guidance, which now includes Innovyze and Upchain. We still expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be healthy and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. Given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. We continue to expect about 3/4 of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our economic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. 
For fiscal '22, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to a range of $4.305 billion to $4.385 billion or a 14% to 16% increase over last year, reflecting a partial year contribution from acquisitions, net of the deferred revenue write-down. Given our results are weighted in the second half and Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter, it's obviously too early to change our view on the underlying trajectory of the year, but we're off to a good start. 
We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand to between 30% and 31%, which includes approximately 1 percentage point of negative headwind from acquisitions. 
Finally, we still expect free cash flow to be around $1.6 billion with a broadly neutral impact from acquisitions. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the second fiscal quarter and full year '22. 
With improving economic conditions and easier comparables, we still expect our first quarter revenue growth will be the trough. Our accelerating momentum in fiscal '22 will propel us into fiscal '23, and I am therefore confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow target of $2.4 billion. 
As I begin to look beyond fiscal '23, the digital transformation of the industries we serve, our sustained investment in the cloud and our flexible business model give us a robust platform for double-digit growth. 
Andrew, back to you."

Let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. The secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of AEC, the convergence of design and make and our",1689,"Thank you, Debbie. Let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. The secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of AEC, the convergence of design and make and our expansion into adjacent verticals through organic investment and acquisitions are growing our total addressable market. The evolution of our business model, the value generated by the growing connectivity of our platform for new and legacy customers and the hardening of our systems to noncompliant users enables us to attract, retain more of that potential opportunity, growing our ecosystem and the usage and value we generate from it. 
Turning to AEC. Our unique vision is to connect all the phases of construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that combine horizontal data flow with best-in-class functionality to enable seamless collaboration from planning, design, preconstruction, construction, asset operations and maintenance. The breadth and depth of our solutions distinguish us in the market, and we continue to build on that advantage to industry-leading R&D, which we sustain through the pandemic and acquisitions. 
Our latest product releases reflect that. For example, Revit 2022 is a bridge to more open and interoperable ways of working that accelerate our design customers' digital transformation and improve communication design intent across all disciplines and project phases. 
For construction teams, we released Autodesk Build, Autodesk Takeoff and Autodesk BIM Collaborate as well as product enhancements, which further empower construction teams to drive better business outcomes such as winning more business, reducing rework, delivering projects on time and improving safety by connecting data, workflows and teams across the project life cycle. 
As the construction backlog comes back online and the new project pipeline builds, we are emerging from the pandemic stronger. This is reflected in our success during the quarter. 
For example, Burns & McDonald is a family of companies bringing together an unmatched team of 7,600 engineers, construction professionals, architects, planners, technologists and scientists to design and build critical infrastructure projects. It is at the forefront of technology use and having invested in Revit and BIM 360 design some time ago, most of this data is already in the cloud. 
Monthly active users or MAUs on Autodesk software have grown by 80% since 2018. This quarter, Burns & McDowell renewed its Autodesk EBA and increased its investment with us, adding more cloud-based products from the Autodesk construction portfolio, including Autodesk Build, Pipe, Assemble and Build and Connected. Our unified common data platform enables it to move and collaborate seamlessly from design through construction and to implementation with common workflows across multiple global practices. 
1898 & Company, part of Beans & McDonald is its future-focused Consulting and Technology Solutions division, and it is a founding participant in our tandem digital twin programs. 
The Bolt Company is a $1 billion professional construction services firm in the U.S., focusing on integrated delivery of complex vertical construction projects that require extremely tight collaboration between stakeholders and integrated workflows between industry partners, the office and seals. 
Vault was already relying on BIM Collaborate Pro and PlanGrid when this quarter, it selected Autodesk Build over a directly competitive construction project management solution and also invested in Pipe. Autodesk Construction Cloud's unified platform connects previously siloed data, reduces rework and saves time for Vault across the company enabling teams to easily manage projects from planning and design through to the field and handover. 
And MultiGreen, a real estate development and operating company specializing in sustainable and tech-enabled multifamily housing in high-growth and supply-constrained markets, standardized on Autodesk Construction Cloud. In order to build more efficiently and sustainably, they knew they had to standardize on a single platform to connect their teams from concept and design through project completion and day-to-day operations. 
In addition to Revit, Inventor, BuildingConnected, Artist Takeoff and Artists Build, they will be using BIM 360's integration with the embodied carbon calculator to analyze material carbon initiates with all their data connected through our common data environment. 
In infrastructure, we released Civil 3D, InfraWorks, and AutoCAD MAP 3D and AutoCAD Plant 3D and Recap Pro with enhancements in transportation, water, plant, land development and reality capture. Most importantly, we continue to mature our project delivery platform across design and construction to better support digital project execution that helps our customers increase operational efficiencies, make better design decisions, increase quality and reduce cost and material waste. 
During the quarter, we received notice of an award and design from the Montana Department of Transportation. Instead of a competitor offering, they will be using our AEC collection, which includes Civil 3D, Revit, InfraWorks, Navisworks recap and our common data environment, Autodesk Docs. 
The department was particularly impressed by connected bridge design workflows between Revit and InfraWorks that drive efficiency and sustainability. 
Turning to manufacturing. We have made significant organic investments in addition to Upchain. Inventor 2022 introduced new features and enhancements to speed up product development and interoperability with AutoCAD, Fusion 360 and Revit. 
In Fusion 360, we have introduced new functionality across the entire product development process and numerous integrated extensions that unlock advanced design and manufacturing technologies. 
In Vault, we introduced a new mobile application and web browser experience for engineers and non-CAD users to access their real-time data anywhere and on any device. The potential to converge design and make in the cloud is becoming more of a reality every day to our customer. Autodesk continues to lead that transition. 
AEC Technologies, the world's leading solutions provider for smart devices grew its investment with Autodesk. Having struggled with data management and data integrations in their product life cycle management using a competitor's 3D modeling product, AEC technologies switched to our product design and manufacturing collection with Vault to manage all their data. They found our connected workflows particularly attractive and believe they will improve productivity and collaboration across their teams and enable them to go to market more effectively by increasing flexibility in their supply chain. For data management, our customers can now choose Vault for on-prem and Upchain as they transition to the cloud. 
With the largest number of new commercial users in 2020, Fusion 360's strong momentum continued, growing commercial subscriptions to 152,000 without any systematic cost promotions. While still early in its life cycle, we believe Fusion 360 has reached an adoption tipping point. And with extensions and Upchain, we are excited about its future. 
During the quarter, a U.K.-based design, manufacturing and installer of architectural precast invested in Fusion 360 in its nesting and fabrication extension. By converting the design and manufacturing process into a single unified experience in the cloud, Fusion 360 enables faster design, prototyping and go-to-market. By creating optimized and associative multi-sheet layouts for sheet metal and nonsheet metal parts in preparation for cutting on CNC machines, our nesting and fabrication extension helps them to significantly reduce waste. 
Last month, 3 students from Danville Community College in Virginia won the inaugural project FG National Championship, an advanced manufacturing competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. Jeremiah Williams, Director for Integrated Machining Technology at Gamble Community Colleges said that, ""By testing a variety of advanced skills like welding and multiaccess machining as well as communication and teamwork, the project MFG National Championship is one of the most challenging skilled trade competitions in the country. Fusion 360's next-generation platform enabled our team to complete all required and optional objectives from prototype through to welding and machining the finished product and to win this prestigious prize."" 
As announced last quarter, we expanded our multiuser trade-in to August 2023, but we are still seeing customers convert and benefit from kind of transition to named users. SSP, one of the leading integrated design offices in Germany traded in their multiuser licenses with us this quarter and significantly increased their investment by purchasing additional AEC collections and premium subscriptions, in the process, may completely replace the competitive design solution, standardizing their workflow on our cloud platform. 
The premium plan is especially valuable to them as they improve their site-to-site management using single sign-on, which enables more digital collaboration and efficiency while increasing employee satisfaction. 
While we continue to be sensitive as the economy recovers, we are successfully converting noncompliant users to paying customers with Q1 license compliance billings almost doubling year-over-year during the quarter. 
For example, a noncompliant client customer converted into one of our largest premium customers to date. Over 500 branches in Indonesia made it difficult to track and manage software usage, and this customer was inadvertently using more licenses than it was paying for. After completing a self-audit, which confirmed the software gap, it purchased premium to help manage the complex rollout of compliant licenses. They are now a happy premium customer with detailed usage insights and the ability to flexibly manage their licenses from headquarters across their entire branch network. 
Now let me finish with a story. Construction began on Notre Dame Cathedral in 1163 but was not completed for more than 100 years. In a 12 century version of lightweighting, Notre-Dame was the first topic structure to use client buttresses, which are slanted teams that support the heavy walls and ceilings that enable giant Lowe's glass and stain glass windows in large edifice, with open air space as a net. 
Following a catastrophic fire in 2019, the cathedral is being rebuilt with traditional and sustainable materials enhanced by next-generation building information modeling provided by Autodesk. Combining traditional design and build know-how with modern workflow solutions, reconstruction is expected to be completed in 2024 in time to welcome athletes at the Summer Olympics in Paris and future generations from across the globe. 
I share this because as the world rebuilds after the catastrophic impact of the pandemic, I am reminded again that Autodesk's purpose to enable its customers to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably has never been more important to urgent. Together, we can meet the generational challenges posed by carbon, water and waste. Autodesk's essential role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future. 
With that, operator, we would like to open the call up for questions."

Let me ask you, Andrew, first, a couple of business and technology or technology evolution questions. You highlighted infrastructure. And the company has been in that business for many, many years, and you'll recall that once a time was, in fact, a reporting segment and maybe should be again at some point. Could you describe the main ways in which that business has evolved over the last number of years in terms of its scope or its customer base? And what the vision really is for that business in terms of perhaps adding new types of customers, such as owner operators that have not really been a large part of your business profile to date. 
Secondly, since we're halfway between AU 2020 and 2021, could you update us on some of the important initiatives that you yourself highlighted during your Q&A session at AU 6 months ago, mainly the forge road map and its implications for you long term. And secondarily, sharing technology across the portfolio and across industries. In other words, leveraging your R&D more and more across the company in that respect."

All right, Jay, let me start with the infrastructure discussion. So here's what fundamentally stand the business. One We've been winning more and more departments of transportation as we've progressed since the last time the infrastructure business was broken out. And what we did is we focused our organic portfolio very much on road and rail work, bridges, roads and rails and created a lot of work between Civil 3D and InfraWorks, and some of our specific tools. And we've been very happy with the progress we've been making there, and we continue that organic investment targeting those pieces of infrastructure. 
We don't feel it needs to be broken out into a separate business because I think you might recall, since those days, we've moved our entire sales organization to account-based sales, so it's very easy to cover these types of customers with the kinds of support that we need to engage with them directly. 
Look, Waters Next, as you can see with what we've been doing with Tandem and the digital twin work and also with what we've acquired with Innovyze with their Info 360 solution and some of the tools around there with digital twins for what waste management and water management. We're definitely moving closer to things that are directly relevant to owner operators. And I would -- you would expect to see us do more of that as time progresses, okay? So that kind of gives you a sense for what we're looking at and how we've gotten here. 
Now with regard to AU initiatives, I don't want to kind of preempt next AU's announcements. But what I'll tell you is we continue to add additional capabilities to forge into the APIs. And I think this coming AU, you're going to hear me talk a lot more about some of the common experiences we're creating across some of our new environments that we're building through our various customers. So I want to hold on to some of that news as we move forward to the next AU. But the hint is there's some common data experiences. There's some common ways of managing and accessing projects that we're developing, deploying, all things that are relevant to making the platform more powerful for bringing together the various products that our customers use."

What I can tell you is that usage of some of our more engineering intensive products is going up pretty significantly, okay? And we talked a lot about usage every year, with regards to how the monthly active usage and the daily active users is going in various countries. 
What we've seen is the majority of our countries are now at or above pre-COVID levels. The U.K. is now above pre-COVID levels. The U.S. still struggling a little bit to get above pre-COVID levels, but showing a lot of robust impact. 
You also noticed -- I think you probably watched the indexes out there, the PMI and the ABI investors, in particular. We have always found those indexes to be lagging indicators of our business. So they actually tell us that something has already happened with the purchasing behavior of our customers. And what you've seen is those indices continuing to shift towards growth, which you hint at, Saket, that it's the book of work that's going up, all right, which means people are going to hire more engineers, they're going to hire more people and they're going to be using our products more. So it's probably driven mostly by hiring related to the book of business of our customers is going up.

And our guidance assumes that we'll see improving results as the year progresses, which is consistent with what we're seeing. We're seeing uncertainty lessening, growing confidence from our customers and our channels and improving demand in our end markets, which is resulting in accelerating growth in new business. 
We're also seeing increasing renewal rates, strong direct business, particularly through the eStore. Our total direct revenue grew 25% year-over-year in Q1 and now represents 33% of total revenue. 
We're also pleased that we're starting to see momentum in key indicators like RPO, which grew 22% year-over-year in Q1. And it's because of these factors that we're confident in the ramp during fiscal '22. Now if I shift attention to fiscal '23 and even beyond that, let me just break that down a little bit. 
I mentioned on the call that since I rejoined Autodesk, I've been focused on 2 primary things. The first is reappointing myself with everything Autodesk: the team, the strategy, what's happened while I was away for a couple of years. And the second is digging deep to get a solid understanding of the fiscal '22 budget and our fiscal '23 financial goals. It's because of that work that I see significant opportunities for growth, including a growing TAM, from things like accelerating digitization in AEC, the convergence of design and make and manufacturing, an expansion into adjacent verticals, like you saw us do recently with the acquisition of Innovyze that got us into water infrastructure. 
We're also focused on further monetizing our TAM in a variety of ways. Some examples include conversion of noncompliant users. Andrew mentioned that billings from noncompliant users almost doubled year-over-year in Q1, and we're seeing more direct selling, as I just mentioned, and that direct selling gets us greater price realization that is another growth driver for us. 
This is all against a macroeconomic backdrop that we see improving. And it's because of all of this that we're confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and the free cash flow target of $2.4 billion in that period. 
Now I've been back for 90 days, less than 90 days actually. So next step for me is more work on the long-range financial plan and getting a deeper understanding of our past in fiscal '24 and beyond. Our goal is to drive double-digit growth using some kind of rule of 40 type framework over time."

So as you know, Upchain is PLM and PDM, product data management, products -- and product life cycle management in the cloud. So it's a fully cloud-native application. It's got both product data management and PLM. It understands both files and cloud information models like with Power Fusion, for example. 
Our vision for how this is going to work is Fusion already has a stack built on its cloud information model that goes all the way through simple data management up through into product life cycle management. Upchain will likely replace that capability within Fusion over time. But more importantly, what Upchain does is it supports a whole swath of legacy applications from our competitors and from other places. So what we're going to do is we're going to go into accounts with legacy applications or where we see overlap with other applications and combine the Fusion stack and the Upchain stack to handle the whole swath of data our customers use. Now ultimately, as well, what we're going to do is we're going to integrate Upchain with Vault so that Vault can now have an extension to the cloud. 
We're not going to force our Vault users to move from on-prem to the cloud. Vault is a very popular application. We sell a lot of it every quarter. And we're going to continue to update and maintain it. You might have noticed that we just released a mobile and extension to it and some web -- additional web extensions capability for Vault. So we continue to dry Vault, but we are going to integrate Vault and Upchain over time, which will give our Vault customers a path to putting all their data in the cloud as they see fit to do it, but we're not going to force that migration. 
So look for it to replace the guts to Fusion life cycle over time and integrate with Fusion cloud information model and look for it to integrate with Vault over time and provide a path for Vault customers to the cloud. And then ultimately, look for us to be going after legacy systems with a combination of our Fusion offering and Upchain's capability to bring all the customers' data and all the applications the customer use together in one robust cloud environment."

And we're getting -- we're definitely getting some good indications. One of the things we watch are the bids -- the activity on bid board through our BuildingConnected service. 
That activity has been going up in Q1. It's been progressively going up each month, which is great. So we see a lot of activity heading into there. Just like a lot of our businesses, we expect some of the new business to be back-end loaded. But we're super happy with where we are right now. We had a good launch of Autodesk Build. It's getting good take-up and monthly active usage from some of our customers. New customers are embracing it. Our international expansion efforts that we put on hold last year because the pandemic are now moving into full year this year. 
Later this year, we roll out Autodesk Build to the channel, and that's going to accelerate Build's business. And one other thing I just want to highlight is why we're winning, okay? And why we continue to win business and why we're so incredibly confident about the future. Here's what customers tell us, right? 
The end-to-end solution that we offer, all the way from planning -- early planning to design through preconstruction, to preconstruction planning to site execution, all the way to digital handoff to actual maintenance and operations of the asset. Nobody has this, especially to the depth that we have in each one of those disciplines. The other thing that people are really excited about is the deep integration with them and the fact that it's a BIM native platform. It speaks BIM from the get-go. It will always speak BIM, and it's really good at it. This is driving more and more displacement of competitive solutions and accounts where we overlap. 
And one of the other big things that we hear from customers is our business model flexibility, all right? Customers love that they can buy from us where they need to buy from us and how they need to buy from us, right? 
If you need a project-based license, we've got it. If you need a consumption-based model, we got it. If you need a per-user model, we got it. We adapt and flex our business model to whatever the particular customers' needs are or their ecosystem's needs are, and we can do it anywhere in the world. 
So if we're dealing with an international customer, they know that when they standardize on us, they can get everywhere with the solution we do. So that's why we're winning. That's why we're bullish as we move into the next year and why we're excited about the construction market becoming hot and active again. The digitization of this market, a multiyear trend, there's lots of opportunity for lots of people, and we're seeing lots of validation in the direction we're heading. And I think it's going to be an exciting year for digital construction."

We're also seeing -- and this is super important. We're seeing increased purchases within accounts we penetrated previously, which means we're moving from kind of being a niche solution inside these companies or maybe partially a piloted solution to production. 
And that's also an important driver. And we expect these trends to continue this year and continue moving forward. And one of the really exciting things about this is we talked about growth beyond FY '23 and in FY '24 and '25 and beyond. The early success we're seeing in Fusion right now is going to be a growth engine that continues to accelerate over the next 5 years, especially as we start introducing our new design -- our extensions. We already have 1 for advanced manufacturing. We have various other extensions. There's going to be new extensions in the second half of the year. Those extensions are continue to be out there. 
We're particularly excited that we sold more Fusion than other applications in Q1 without any type of promotional activity. All of this points towards increasing customer demand for what we're doing."

So I can't tell you precisely if this is one of the pipeline drivers. But I can tell you that we're mentioning it to customers, and we're having customers about, ""Hey, conversation with customers who want to keep your material costs down, digitize, right?

Even the infrastructure bill could be a wildcard for us. We're hopeful, although nothing is baked into our numbers at this point. But these are all the multiple growth drivers that give me confidence in the ramp. 
I think some of the other data points that we have out there, I'll repeat because these are the things, frankly, that I've been looking at to get my own sense of confidence into that ramp into fiscal '23, the conversion of noncompliant users, the fact that those billings doubled in Q1, and we're seeing more success with that program, the fact that we are selling more direct, that's a driver of growth for us and ultimately, will translate to free cash flow over time. the improving macroeconomic backdrop, all of these factors combined are what give me confidence in our ability to achieve our revenue growth potential in fiscal '23 as well as that free cash flow number of $2.4 billion."

Where it's actually most of the business is about going after incremental seats inside of competitive accounts, especially down market. The one great thing about our strategy is most of the inventor is bought through collections, which includes Fusion. 
So if an inventor user does start to move to Fusion over time, they continue on the same subscription path we're on. And what we'll do with our collections is some of the extensions that would be available to a vanilla Fusion user that they'd have to pay for would be included with the collections version. So essentially, what you see is a kind of an ASP neutral conversion from inventor to Fusion. But that's going to take a long time. Most of the inventor customers are going to stay comfortably where they are. But when they do move, it's essentially ASP neutral in terms of impact on our ARR. It doesn't change the APP trajectory."

Now while parts of the world emerge from the pandemic, others are entering the eye of the storm. I especially want to acknowledge our colleagues, family and friends in India. We are thinking about you, and we are helping wherever we can.  
Thank you to all our employees and their families, our partners and customers for their continued resilience, patience and commitment.  
Our first quarter marks an important inflection point. While solid execution, a resilient subscription business model and continued secular shift to the cloud underpinned our strong first quarter results, weighing uncertainty and growing confidence in our end markets generated momentum. Robust growth in new product subscriptions, combined with improving usage and renewal rates, accelerated billings and RPO growth to 10% and 22%, respectively. Together, these reinforce our confidence that we are through the revenue growth trough and on track to achieve our fiscal '22 and '23 goals.  
In mid-May, we completed the acquisition of Upchain, a cloud-native product data and life cycle management solution. Combined with existing Autodesk offerings like Fusion 360, Upchain will profoundly simplify data sharing and collaboration for engineers, manufacturers, suppliers and other product stakeholders, enabling customers to bring products to market faster and build a stronger supply chain. Its next-generation platform enables it to be rapidly deployed, scaled, maintained and updated without the expensive inflexible and time-consuming integrations of legacy systems.  
We will grow Upchain through our enterprise and channel partnerships and expect it to become a meaningful on-ramp for legacy design tools to the Fusion 360 cloud ecosystem and facilitate further expansion into adjacent verticals.  
As we highlighted in our recently published Impact Report, the convergence of design and make brings both greater efficiency and sustainability to buildings in a broad range of manufactured goods, stretching from EVs and bicycles to high-performance skis and low-cost ventilators. While we are enabling customers to achieve their sustainability targets, we continue to lead by example, reaching our carbon-neutral goal across our business and value chain in fiscal '21.  
The report also sets out new diversity, equity and inclusion goals. And while I'm proud that 50% of Autodesk Board and 45% of our executive team are women, we can and will do more both internally and through partnerships with organizations like IFF Labs externally.  
As we recently announced, Pascal Di Fronzo, Autodesk's Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief Legal Officer, will be retiring in December after 23 very successful years at the company. He has been a trusted counselor and steward of the company. His contributions to Autodesk are many and have been incredibly impactful, and I want to thank him for his dedication and wish him all the best in retirement.  
I am very excited to welcome Debbie back to Autodesk, and will now turn the call over to her to take you through the details of our quarterly results and guidance for the year. I will then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives."
119902,713473093,2303247,"Autodesk, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, May 27, 2021",2021-05-27,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. I'm very excited to be back.  Looking at the first quarter's results, several factors contributed to our strong financial performance, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales, stronger-than-expect",997,"Thanks, Andrew. I'm very excited to be back.  
Looking at the first quarter's results, several factors contributed to our strong financial performance, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales, stronger-than-expected upfront revenue and improving subscription renewal rates.  
In addition, a 1-month contribution from Innovyze and foreign exchange rates provided a modest tailwind to the quarter. Total revenue in the quarter grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 18%.  
Looking at revenue by product and geography, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew by 9%. AEC revenue grew 16% and manufacturing revenue grew 8%. Excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, which we discussed last quarter, manufacturing revenue grew double digits. M&E revenue grew 5%. Across the globe, revenue grew 8% in the Americas, 11% in EMEA and 20% in APAC. Direct revenue increased 25% and represented 33% of our total revenue, up from 30% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. Our e-commerce sites had their highest new billings growth rate in 2 years, driven by strong traffic growth and recent site enhancements.  
Reflecting the business-critical nature of our products to our customers, our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range, and our product subscription renewal rates strengthened.  Our billings accelerated 10% to $974 million. Total deferred revenue grew 11% to $3.35 billion. Short-term deferred revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting growth in new product subscriptions and increasing renewal rates, but also the inclusion of Innovyze. This was partly offset by a smaller contribution from long-term deferred revenue, resulting from fewer multiyear contracts when compared to last year.  
Total RPO of $4.23 billion and current RPO of $2.86 billion both grew 22%. Current RPO growth was primarily driven by the increase in short-term deferred revenue, but also by strong growth in enterprise business agreements and, to a lesser extent, early renewals ahead of anticipated price increases. Excluding the contribution from early renewals and Innovyze, current RPO grew approximately 20%.  
Non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin remained strong at 92% and 28%, respectively, broadly level year-over-year and reflecting the trough in revenue growth relative to cost growth. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $316 million during the quarter, driven by collections of prior quarter billings and strong results in the current quarter. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continued to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the first quarter, we purchased 515,000 shares for $143 million at an average price of approximately $277 per share.  
Now I'll shift to giving you my initial thoughts as CFO and then finish with our outlook. Since I rejoined Autodesk about 2 months ago, I've been focused on 2 things: first, reacquainting myself with everything Autodesk, the team, our strategy and how we've evolved during my 2 years away; and second, I've been digging deep to gain a solid understanding of our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals.  
On the first point, while much at Autodesk is familiar to me, I've been pleasantly surprised by how much has changed for the better, reflecting the enormous progress Autodesk has made over the last 2 years. Autodesk has undergone a cultural revolution. There's been a powerful shift in the company's values and ways we work, and the pace of decision-making has accelerated.  
As a company, we now benefit not only from the scale of our operation, but also from a newfound agility that is enabling our success in newer markets like construction and manufacturing in the cloud. I'm also struck by the compelling and expanding opportunities ahead of us. Digital transformation is happening now, it is real, and we are well positioned to capitalize on that trend in the industries we serve. As I begin to turn my attention to our long-range financial plan, these initial learnings give me confidence in our growth potential in fiscal '24 and beyond.  
Let me finish with our guidance, which now includes Innovyze and Upchain. We still expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. We expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be healthy and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. Given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. We continue to expect about 3/4 of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our economic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality.  
For fiscal '22, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to a range of $4.305 billion to $4.385 billion or a 14% to 16% increase over last year, reflecting a partial year contribution from acquisitions, net of the deferred revenue write-downs. Given our results are weighted in the second half and Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter, it's obviously too early to change our view on the underlying trajectory of the year, but we're off to a good start.  
We expect non-GAAP operating margin to expand to between 30% and 31%, which includes approximately 1 percentage point of negative headwind from acquisitions.  
Finally, we still expect free cash flow to be around $1.6 billion with a broadly neutral impact from acquisitions. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the second fiscal quarter and full year '22. With improving economic conditions and easier comparables, we still expect our first quarter revenue growth will be the trough. Our accelerating momentum in fiscal '22 will propel us into fiscal '23, and I am therefore confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow target of $2.4 billion.  
As I begin to look beyond fiscal '23, the digital transformation of the industries we serve, our sustained investment in the cloud and our flexible business model give us a robust platform for double-digit growth. Andrew, back to you."

Let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. The secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of AEC, the convergence of design and make and our",1687,"Thank you, Debbie. Let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. The secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of AEC, the convergence of design and make and our expansion into adjacent verticals through organic investment and acquisitions are growing our total addressable market. The evolution of our business model, the value generated by the growing connectivity of our platform for new and legacy customers and the hardening of our systems to noncompliant users enables us to attract, retain more of that potential opportunity, growing our ecosystem and the usage and value we generate from it. 
Turning to AEC. Our unique vision is to connect all the phases of construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that combine horizontal data flow with best-in-class functionality to enable seamless collaboration from planning, design, preconstruction, construction, asset operations and maintenance. The breadth and depth of our solutions distinguish us in the market, and we continue to build on that advantage to industry-leading R&D, which we sustain through the pandemic and acquisitions. 
Our latest product releases reflect that. For example, Revit 2022 is a bridge to more open and interoperable ways of working that accelerate our design customers' digital transformation and improve communication design intent across all disciplines and project phases. For construction teams, we released Autodesk Build, Autodesk Takeoff and Autodesk BIM Collaborate as well as product enhancements, which further empower construction teams to drive better business outcomes such as winning more business, reducing rework, delivering projects on time and improving safety by connecting data, workflows and teams across the project life cycle. 
As the construction backlog comes back online and the new project pipeline builds, we are emerging from the pandemic stronger. This is reflected in our success during the quarter. For example, Burns & McDonnell is a family of companies bringing together an unmatched team of 7,600 engineers, construction professionals, architects, planners, technologists and scientists to design and build critical infrastructure projects. It is at the forefront of technology use and having invested in Revit and BIM 360 design some time ago, most of its data is already in the cloud. 
Monthly active users, or MAUs, on Autodesk software have grown by 80% since 2018. This quarter, Burns & McDonnell renewed its Autodesk EBA and increased its investment with us, adding more cloud-based products from the Autodesk construction portfolio, including Autodesk Build, Pipe, Assemble and BuildingConnected. Our unified common data platform enables it to move and collaborate seamlessly from design through construction and to implementation with common workflows across multiple global practices. 
1898 & Co., part of Burns & McDonnell, is its future-focused consulting and technology solutions division, and it is a founding participant in our Tandem digital twin programs. The Vault company is a $1 billion professional construction services firm in the U.S., focusing on integrated delivery of complex vertical construction projects that require extremely tight collaboration between stakeholders and integrated workflows between industry partners, the office and seals. 
Vault was already relying on BIM Collaborate Pro and PlanGrid when, this quarter, it selected Autodesk Build over a directly competitive construction project management solution and also invested in Pipe. Autodesk Construction Cloud's unified platform connects previously siloed data, reduces rework and saves time for Vault across the company, enabling teams to easily manage projects from planning and design through to the field and handover. 
And MultiGreen, a real estate development and operating company specializing in sustainable and tech-enabled multifamily housing in high-growth and supply-constrained markets, standardized on Autodesk Construction Cloud. In order to build more efficiently and sustainably, they knew they had to standardize on a single platform to connect their teams from concept and design through project completion and day-to-day operations. In addition to Revit, Inventor, BuildingConnected, Autodesk Takeoff and Autodesk Build, they will be using BIM 360's integration with the Embodied Carbon Calculator to analyze material carbon emissions with all their data connected through our common data environment. 
In infrastructure, we released Civil 3D, InfraWorks, and AutoCAD MAP 3D and AutoCAD Plant 3D and ReCap Pro with enhancements in transportation, water, plant, land development and reality capture. Most importantly, we continue to mature our project delivery platform across design and construction to better support digital project execution that helps our customers increase operational efficiencies, make better design decisions, increase quality and reduce cost and material waste. 
During the quarter, we received notice of an award and design from the Montana Department of Transportation. Instead of a competitor offering, they will be using our AEC collection, which includes Civil 3D, Revit, InfraWorks, Navisworks ReCap and our common data environment, Autodesk Docs. The department was particularly impressed by connected bridge design workflows between Revit and InfraWorks that drive efficiency and sustainability. 
Turning to manufacturing. We have made significant organic investments in addition to Upchain. Inventor 2022 introduced new features and enhancements to speed up product development and interoperability with AutoCAD, Fusion 360 and Revit. In Fusion 360, we have introduced new functionality across the entire product development process and numerous integrated extensions that unlock advanced design and manufacturing technologies. 
In Vault, we introduced a new mobile application and web browser experience for engineers and non-CAD users to access their real-time data anywhere and on any device. The potential to converge design and make in the cloud is becoming more of a reality every day to our customer. Autodesk continues to lead that transition. 
AEC Technologies, the world's leading solutions provider for smart devices, grew its investment with Autodesk. Having struggled with data management and data integrations in their product life cycle management using a competitor's 3D modeling product, AEC Technologies switched to our product design and manufacturing collection with Vault to manage all their data. They found our connected workflows particularly attractive and believe they will improve productivity and collaboration across their teams and enable them to go to market more effectively by increasing flexibility in their supply chain. For data management, our customers can now choose Vault for on-prem and Upchain as they transition to the cloud. 
With the largest number of new commercial users in 2020, Fusion 360's strong momentum continued, growing commercial subscriptions to 152,000 without any systematic cost promotions. While still early in its life cycle, we believe Fusion 360 has reached an adoption tipping point. And with extensions and Upchain, we are excited about its future. 
During the quarter, a U.K.-based design, manufacturing and installer of architectural precast design invested in Fusion 360 in its nesting and fabrication extension. By converting the design and manufacturing process into a single unified experience in the cloud, Fusion 360 enables faster design, prototyping and go-to-market. By creating optimized and associative multi-sheet layouts for sheet metal and non-sheet metal parts in preparation for cutting on CNC machines, our nesting and fabrication extension helps them to significantly reduce waste. 
Last month, 3 students from Danville Community College in Virginia won the inaugural Project MFG National Championship, an advanced manufacturing competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense. Jeremiah Williams, Director for Integrated Machining Technology at Danville Community College said that, ""By testing a variety of advanced skills like welding and multiaccess machining as well as communication and teamwork, the Project MFG National Championship is one of the most challenging skilled trade competitions in the country. Fusion 360's next-generation platform enabled our team to complete all required and optional objectives from prototype through to welding and machining the finished product and to win this prestigious prize."" 
As announced last quarter, we expanded our multiuser trade-in to August 2023, but we are still seeing customers convert and benefit from kind of transition to named users. SSP, one of the leading integrated design offices in Germany, traded in their multiuser licenses with us this quarter and significantly increased their investment by purchasing additional AEC collections and premium subscriptions, in the process, may completely replace the competitive design solution, standardizing their workflow on our cloud platform. 
The premium plan is especially valuable to them as they improve their site-to-site management using single sign-on, which enables more digital collaboration and efficiency while increasing employee satisfaction. 
While we continue to be sensitive as the economy recovers, we are successfully converting noncompliant users to paying customers with Q1 license compliance billings almost doubling year-over-year during the quarter. For example, a noncompliant client customer converted into one of our largest premium customers to date. Over 500 branches in Indonesia made it difficult to track and manage software usage, and this customer was inadvertently using more licenses than it was paying for. After completing a self-audit, which confirmed the software gap, it purchased premium to help manage the complex rollout of compliant licenses. They are now a happy premium customer with detailed usage insights and the ability to flexibly manage their licenses from headquarters across their entire branch network. 
Now let me finish with a story. Construction began on Notre Dame Cathedral in 1163, but was not completed for more than 100 years. In a 12th century version of lightweighting, Notre-Dame was the first Gothic structure to use flying buttresses, which are slanted beams that support the heavy walls and ceilings that enable giant rose glass and stained glass windows in large edifices with open air spaces beneath them. 
Following a catastrophic fire in 2019, the cathedral is being rebuilt with traditional and sustainable materials enhanced by next-generation building information modeling provided by Autodesk. Combining traditional design and build know-how with modern workflow solutions, reconstruction is expected to be completed in 2024 in time to welcome athletes at the Summer Olympics in Paris and future generations from across the globe. 
I share this because as the world rebuilds after the catastrophic impact of the pandemic, I am reminded again that Autodesk's purpose to enable its customers to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably has never been more important or urgent. Together, we can meet the generational challenges posed by carbon, water and waste. Autodesk's central role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future. 
With that, operator, we would like to open the call up for questions."

Could you describe the main ways in which that business has evolved over the last number of years in terms of its scope or its customer base? And what the vision really is for that business in terms of perhaps adding new types of customers, such as owner-operators that have not really been a large part of your business profile to date. 
Secondly, since we're halfway between AU 2020 and AU 2021, could you update us on some of the important initiatives that you yourself highlighted during your Q&A session at AU 6 months ago, mainly the Forge road map and its implications for you long term, and secondarily, sharing technology across the portfolio and across industries. In other words, leveraging your R&D more and more across the company in that respect."

All right, Jay, so let me start with the infrastructure discussion. So here's what fundamentally staying with the business. One, we've been winning more and more departments of transportation as we've progressed since the last time the infrastructure business was broken out. And what we did is we focused our organic portfolio very much on road and rail work, bridges, roads and rails, and created a lot of workflows between Civil 3D and InfraWorks, and some of our specific tools. And we've been very happy with the progress we've been making there, and we continue that organic investment targeting those pieces of infrastructure. 
We don't feel it needs to be broken out into a separate business because I think you might recall, since those days, we've moved our entire sales organization to account-based sales, so it's very easy to cover these types of customers with the kinds of support that we need to engage with them directly. 
Look, water's next, as you can see with what we've been doing with Tandem and the digital twin work and also with what we've acquired with Innovyze with their Info360 solution and some of the tools around there with digital twins for waste management and water management. We're definitely moving closer to things that are directly relevant to owner-operators. And I would -- you would expect to see us do more of that as time progresses, okay? So that kind of gives you a sense for what we're looking at and how we've gotten here. 
Now with regard to AU initiatives, I don't want to kind of preempt next AU's announcements. But what I'll tell you is we continue to add additional capabilities to forge into the APIs. And I think this coming AU, you're going to hear me talk a lot more about some of the common experiences we're creating across some of our new environments that we're building through our various customers. So I want to hold on to some of that news as we move forward to the next AU. But the hint is there's some common data experiences. There's some common ways of managing and accessing projects that we're developing and deploying, all things that are relevant to making the platform more powerful for bringing together the various products that our customers use."

Maybe in particular, how much of this recovery do you feel is in demand, that is do you feel is tied to increased engineering hiring versus perhaps pent-up demand for tools post-pandemic, just as we kind of think about the pace of this recovery going forward? Does that make sense?"

So I really -- I can't really give you a fine grain view on that. 
What I can tell you is that usage of some of our more engineering intensive products is going up pretty significantly, okay? And we talked a lot about usage every year with regards to how the monthly active users and the daily active users is going in various countries. What we've seen is the majority of our countries are now at or above pre-COVID levels. The U.K. is now above pre-COVID levels. The U.S. still struggling a little bit to get above pre-COVID levels, but showing a lot of robust impact. 
You also noticed -- I think you probably watched the indexes out there, the PMI and the ABI indices, in particular. We have always found those indices to be lagging indicators of our business. So they actually tell us that something has already happened with the purchasing behavior of our customers. And what you've seen is those indices continuing to shift towards growth, which you hint at, Saket, that it's the book of work that's going up, all right, which means people are going to hire more engineers, they're going to hire more people and they're going to engage -- they're going be using our products more. So it's probably driven mostly by hiring related to the book of business of our customers is going up. The indices seem to indicate that as a lagging indicator of what we've seen in terms of purchasing behavior and usage. But that's kind of as much granularity as I can give you on that."

And our guidance assumes that we'll see improving results as the year progresses, which is consistent with what we're seeing. We're seeing uncertainty lessening, growing confidence from our customers and our channels and improving demand in our end markets, which is resulting in accelerating growth in new business. 
We're also seeing increasing renewal rates, strong direct business, particularly through the eStore. Our total direct revenue grew 25% year-over-year in Q1 and now represents 33% of total revenue. We're also pleased that we're starting to see momentum in key indicators like RPO, which grew 22% year-over-year in Q1. And it's because of these factors that we're confident in the ramp during fiscal '22. Now if I shift attention to fiscal '23 and even beyond that, let me just break that down a little bit. 
I mentioned on the call that since I rejoined Autodesk, I've been focused on 2 primary things. The first is reacquainting myself with everything Autodesk, the team, the strategy, what's happened while I was away for a couple of years. And the second is digging deep to get a solid understanding of the fiscal '22 budget and our fiscal '23 financial goals. It's because of that work that I see significant opportunities for growth, including a growing TAM, from things like accelerating digitization in AEC, the convergence of design and make in manufacturing, an expansion into adjacent verticals, like you saw us do recently with the acquisition of Innovyze that got us into water infrastructure. 
We're also focused on further monetizing our TAM in a variety of ways. Some examples include conversion of noncompliant users. Andrew mentioned that billings from noncompliant users almost doubled year-over-year in Q1, and we're seeing more direct selling, as I just mentioned, and that direct selling gets us greater price realization that is another growth driver for us. This is all against a macroeconomic backdrop that we see improving. And it's because of all of this that we're confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and the free cash flow target of $2.4 billion in that period. 
Now I've been back for 90 days, less than 90 days, actually. So next step for me is more work on the long-range financial plan and getting a deeper understanding of our path in fiscal '24 and beyond. Our goal is to drive double-digit growth using some kind of rule of 40 type framework over time."

So as you know, Upchain is PLM and PDM, product data management, product -- and product life cycle management in the cloud. So it's a fully cloud-native application. It's got both product data management and PLM. It understands both files and cloud information models like with Power Fusion, for example. 
Our vision for how this is going to work is Fusion already has a stack built on its cloud information model that goes all the way through simple data management up through into product life cycle management. Upchain will likely replace that capability within Fusion over time. But more importantly, what Upchain does is it supports a whole swath of legacy applications from our competitors and from other places. So what we're going to do is we're going to go into accounts with legacy applications or where we see overlap with other applications and combine the Fusion stack and the Upchain stack to handle the whole swath of data our customers use. Now ultimately, as well, what we're going to do is we're going to integrate Upchain with Vault so that Vault can now have an extension to the cloud. 
We're not going to force our Vault users to move from on-prem to the cloud. Vault is a very popular application. We sell a lot of it every quarter. And we're going to continue to update and maintain it. You might have noticed that we just released a mobile and extension to it and some web -- additional web extensions capability for Vault. So we continue to drive Vault, but we are going to integrate Vault and Upchain over time, which will give our Vault customers a path to putting all their data in the cloud as they see fit to do it, but we're not going to force that migration. 
So look for it to replace the guts of Fusion life cycle over time and integrate with Fusion cloud information model and look for it to integrate with Vault over time and provide a path for Vault customers to the cloud. And then ultimately, look for us to be going after legacy systems with a combination of our Fusion offering and Upchain's capability to bring all the customers' data and all the applications the customer use together in one robust cloud environment."

And we're getting -- we're definitely getting some good indications. One of the things we watch are the bids -- the activity on bid board through our BuildingConnected service. That activity has been going up in Q1. It's been progressively going up each month, which is great. So we see a lot of activity heading into there. 
Just like a lot of our businesses, we expect some of the new business to be back-end loaded. But we're super happy with where we are right now. We had a good launch of Autodesk Build. It's getting good take-up in monthly active usage from some of our customers. New customers are embracing it. Our international expansion efforts that we put on hold last year because of the pandemic are now moving into full year this year. 
Later this year, we roll out Autodesk Build to the channel, and that's going to accelerate Build's business. And one other thing I just want to highlight is why we're winning, okay, and why we continue to win business and why we're so incredibly confident about the future. Here's what customers tell us, right? 
The end-to-end solution that we offer, all the way from planning -- early planning to design to preconstruction to preconstruction planning to site execution, all the way to digital handoff to actual maintenance and operations of the asset, nobody has this, especially to the depths that we have in each one of those disciplines. The other thing that people are really excited about is the deep integration with them and the fact that it's a BIM-native platform. It speaks BIM from the get-go. It will always speak BIM, and it's really good at it. This is driving more and more displacement of competitive solutions and accounts where we overlap. 
And one of the other big things that we hear from customers is our business model flexibility, all right? Customers love that they can buy from us where they need to buy from us and how they need to buy from us, right? If you need a project-based license, we've got it. If you need a consumption-based model, we got it. If you need a per-user model, we got it. We adapt and flex our business model to whatever the particular customer's needs are or their ecosystem's needs are, and we can do it anywhere in the world. 
So if we're dealing with an international customer, they know that when they standardize on us, they can get everywhere with the solution we do. So that's why we're winning. That's why we're bullish as we move into the next year and why we're excited about the construction market becoming hot and active again. The digitization of this market, a multiyear trend, there's lots of opportunity for lots of people, and we're seeing lots of validation in the direction we're heading. And I think it's going to be an exciting year for digital construction."

And that's also an important driver. And we expect these trends to continue this year and continue moving forward. And one of the really exciting things about this is we talked about growth beyond FY '23 and in FY '24 and '25 and beyond. The early success we're seeing in Fusion right now is going to be a growth engine that continues to accelerate over the next 5 years, especially as we start introducing our new design -- our extensions. We already have one for advanced manufacturing. We have various other extensions. There's going to be new extensions in the second half of the year. Those extensions are continue to be out there.

Even the infrastructure bill could be a wildcard for us. We're hopeful, although nothing is baked into our numbers at this point. But these are all the multiple growth drivers that give me confidence in the ramp. 
I think some of the other data points that we have out there, I'll repeat because these are the things, frankly, that I've been looking at to get my own sense of confidence into that ramp into fiscal '23: the conversion of noncompliant users, the fact that those billings doubled in Q1, and we're seeing more success with that program; the fact that we are selling more direct, that's a driver of growth for us and ultimately, will translate to free cash flow over time; the improving macroeconomic backdrop.

And what we'll do with our collections is some of the extensions that would be available to a vanilla Fusion user that they'd have to pay for would be included with the collections version. So essentially, what you see is a kind of an ASP-neutral conversion from Inventor to Fusion. But that's going to take a long time. Most of the Inventor customers are going to stay comfortably where they are. But when they do move, it's essentially ASP-neutral in terms of impact on our ARR. It doesn't change the ARR trajectory."

I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. 
As we anticipated when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, unwinding uncertainty resulted in increased business confidence, investment and economic growth during our second quarter. This is reflected in strong product usage, which returned to pre-COVID levels across the globe, increasing bid activity on building connected, which reached all-time highs, and greater channel partner confidence. When combined with strong execution, a resilient subscription business model and the continued secular shift to the cloud, our growth accelerated again in Q2 and generated further momentum. 
RPO and billings grew 24% and 29%, respectively, driven by strong new product subscription growth, renewal rates and revenue retention. I am proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year. And again, I thank all of our employees, their families, our partners and customers for their continued dedication, patience and commitment.

As Andrew mentioned, second quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that strength, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales and improving subscription renewal rates. In addition",978,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, second quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that strength, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales and improving subscription renewal rates. 
In addition, Innovyze and foreign exchange rate provided a modest tailwind to the quarter. Total revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 16% and 14% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 21%. 
Looking at revenue by product, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 12%. AEC revenue grew 21%, and manufacturing revenue grew 12%. Excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, manufacturing revenue grew in the mid-teens percent. M&E revenue grew 10%. Across the globe, revenue grew 14% in the Americas; 16% in EMEA; and 21% in APAC. Direct revenue increased 31% and represented 34% of our total revenue, up from 30% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. 
As you'll hear more about at our Investor Day next week, about 3/4 of new customers to Autodesk are now generated through our digital channels, reflecting our efforts to enable a simplified buying experience. 
Our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, and our net revenue retention rate remains within the 100% to 110% range. Billings accelerated 29% to $1 billion, reflecting strong underlying demand and an easier comparison versus last year. Total deferred revenue grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Total RPO of $4.14 billion and current RPO of $2.85 billion both grew 24%. current RPO growth was driven by strong new product sales during the quarter and the ongoing benefit from the record number of EBAs signed in the second half of last year. Excluding the contribution from Innovyze, current RPO grew approximately 23%. 
Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while operating margin increased more than 2 percentage points to 31%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $186 million during the quarter, primarily driven by strong billings growth. 
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the second quarter, we purchased 164,000 shares for $46 million at an average price of approximately $283 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 679,000 shares at an average price of approximately $278 per share for a total spend of $189 million. 
Now I'll turn to guidance. Consistent with previous quarters, we expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. We expect product subscription, volume and renewal rates to continue to be healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%. 
With our strong start to the year, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to a range of $4.345 billion to $4.385 billion, with a midpoint growth rate of 15% year-over-year. We are also raising our non-GAAP operating margin outlook to approximately 31%, an almost 2-point improvement from last year. 
Our strong start to the year means we're also shifting more of our EBA customers from multiyear paid upfront to annual billings, which is good for them and good for Autodesk. Our EBA customers retain price certainty with a multiyear contract term, but annual billings give them a more predictable annual cash outlay. For Autodesk, we generate more predictable cash flow and remove the discounts to generate upfront cash collections. While we had already assumed this change in fiscal '23, it has a modest impact on fiscal '22 billings and free cash flow. However, we expect it to drive more predictable free cash flow growth and better price realization over time, which will make Autodesk a more valuable company. 
The shift of more of our EBA customers from multiyear paid upfront to annual billings and FX account for the change in our fiscal '22 billings guidance and with a onetime M&A-related tax charge, our free cash flow guidance. 
As we look ahead, we're anticipating revenue growth to accelerate in Q3. Strong upfront revenues in Q4 last year, and with Vault now ratable, a smaller pool of nonratable products, create a tougher comparison in Q4 this year, which will reduce revenue growth a bit when compared to the third quarter. Also, our EBA strength in the second half of last year, including 2 of our largest ever deals in Q3, will impact RPO growth comparisons in the second half of our fiscal '22. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the third fiscal quarter and full year fiscal '22. 
As I shared last quarter, my initial focus after rejoining Autodesk was digging into our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals. The strength we've seen in fiscal '22, combined with a significant cohort of multiyear product subscription contracts that we expect will renew in fiscal '23, set us up nicely to achieve our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow goal. 
This past quarter, I turned my attention to our long-range financial plan, with a particular focus on fiscal '24 and beyond. You'll hear more at our Investor Day next week. But to set the stage today, our long-term strategic growth drivers and our flexible subscription business model give us confidence we can achieve our goal of sustainable double-digit revenue and free cash flow growth beyond fiscal '24. Now once we've achieved our fiscal '23 goals, we'll give you more details on our financial ambitions for fiscal '24 and beyond. But on the whole, we believe we have many exciting opportunities to drive growth by further expanding our addressable market into areas like construction and infrastructure as well as by deepening monetization of our user base. And we look forward to sharing more specifics with you at our Investor Day next week. 
Andrew, back to you."

Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve is changing our relationships with our customers from software vendor to strategic part",1602,"Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve is changing our relationships with our customers from software vendor to strategic partner. And that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and business model evolution. By helping our customers grow, we will grow too. 
In AEC, digitization trends are accelerating the need to connect all phases of design and construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions. A great example this quarter was with an Asia Pacific semiconductor manufacturer, which is rapidly expanding its manufacturing capacity around the world and looking for help to drive more efficient collaboration across project stakeholders as well as shorter design and delivery cycles. It invested in AEC collections to accomplish this goal and is now leveraging the power of BIM and our digital AEC workflows to achieve its expansion plan. This is a prime example of how Autodesk is positioned to help our customers as industries converge, with this customer being a long-time user of our manufacturing products and now expanding its footprint with us in AEC. 
In construction, we believe the Autodesk Construction Cloud is the best end-to-end offering across all phases of the construction life cycle. Starting with our industry-leading preconstruction offerings, we help our customers seamlessly convert data into a construction plan, allowing our customers to condition and coordinate models early to aiding clash detection, easily quantify the materials required for future construction and leverage our building connected community to power the bidding process. 
As we turn to the field, Autodesk Build provides a single integrated solution for project management, field collaboration, quality, safety and cost control, which is easy to deploy, adopt and use. We just launched it in February, but we're already -- we've already seen Autodesk Build and use on more than 11,000 customer projects around the world. By connecting project information and teams in one common data environment, it enables efficient collaboration while providing predictive analytics and insights that increase quality and safety while decreasing risk. 
As I mentioned earlier, we've transitioned to being a strategic partner to our customers. And in construction, that means evolving our business model. We provide customers more choice in how they buy. We offer both user and account-based pricing, which gives our customers the flexibility to decide how they want to engage with us on their digital journey. With our account-based pricing model, we're seeing significant benefits from driving as many users as possible to our construction platform. 
Once Autodesk Build has been deployed in a project, we've made it frictionless for anyone involved on the project to get access to our platform within minutes. This pattern is not unlike the evolution of Fusion 360 over the last few years. The more users we see on our platform, the more we learn, the better we make our products and the more value we add to our customers. 
This quarter, [indiscernible] Construction, a top ENR 400 general contractor in the United States, selected Autodesk Build for project management over competitive offerings, Pype for submittal management and BIM collaborate for native class detection. As [ Andy Burd ] from [indiscernible] Construction said, ""Autodesk Build comprehensive unified platform is industry-leading, and by seamlessly connecting design with construction to increase our efficiency establishes a strong partnership foundation and further enables us to build better lives for our customers, communities and each other."" 
Autodesk Build's momentum is growing internationally, too. [ Stan House ] is a leading retail shop construction and renovation company in the Netherlands, which had already used AEC collections in generative design to optimize client retail space, reduced design and construction errors by 15% and improved its ROI by 10%. This quarter, it invested in Autodesk Build to further increase efficiency, reduce waste and add value for its clients by converging workflows from conceptual design to engineering and fabrication while seamlessly collaborating with its clients. Our relationship with [ Stan House ] demonstrates the value that digital construction processes can bring to customers around the world. With our significant international experience and resources, we're well positioned to capitalize on this large growth opportunity. 
And we continue to invest to connect and converge adjacent industries to create value and help our customers achieve greater efficiency. During the quarter, Innovyze's Info360 cloud platform launched a beta version of Info360 Asset, a cloud-based tool for the water industry's condition and performance monitoring and risk management processes. 
We also launched Autodesk Tandem, our digital twin offering focused on harnessing the data from the design and construction process to create a repeatable and dynamic process, with digital handover being the natural output of the project life cycle. 
Turning to manufacturing. We continue to see strong momentum with our manufacturing portfolio this quarter, and we also saw the inclusion of Upchain in its first enterprise business agreement, or EBA, with one of our larger enterprise accounts. The convergence of design and make is accelerating, and we are seeing larger companies expand on our platform. For example, after using Fusion 360 and Moldflow to develop accurate digital manufacturing twins for injection molded parts, which is typically a very iterative, time-consuming and expensive process, one of the largest American multinational medical device and pharmaceutical companies renewed and expanded its EBA with us this quarter. They were able to significantly reduce the time and rework costs because they could anticipate, predict and correct manufacturing issues before moving in production. 
We continue to see subscription growth for Fusion 360 with paying subscriptions now at 165,000, and the Fusion 360 extensions are helping to increase our average revenue per subscriber and capture more potential opportunity. During the quarter, a U.S.-based global leader in design, engineering and manufacturing of woven wire mesh products transitioned to Fusion 360 as their main design tool and invested in our managed extension. The combination of Fusion 360 and managed extensions has largely automated their design to change workflows and has brought a new level of organization and efficiency on product design all the way through delivery. 
Our presence in education continues to expand to address the critical shortage in skilled labor. For example, a growing number of large German companies are replacing competitive solutions and are training their apprentices on Fusion 360 to prepare them for the future of work. In the second quarter, Energie Baden Württemberg AG, EnBW, one of the biggest utility companies in Germany with 25,000 employees, adopted Fusion 360 to train its 600 apprentices. EnBW and its apprentices will benefit from the Fusion 360 cloud collaboration platform serving all their CAD, CAM and CAE needs while they are either on-site or remote. 
Education remains an important market for us, and we continue to broaden our reach with more than 43 million Tinkercad and Fusion 360 education users. We continue to make progress transitioning all of our users to named users, giving customers more visibility into their usage data and allowing us to better serve our paying customers while also making it harder for noncompliant users to access our software. 
The Level Group is a full cycle developer, which specializes in business class complexes. During the quarter, it increased its investment with Autodesk by consolidating all of its single and multiuser subscriptions and permanent licenses to AEC collections with our premium plan and Autodesk Docs to enable more efficient collaboration and license management. And with the help of 24/7 technical support and single sign-on capability, Level Group expects reduced design costs in the future. 
As our existing paying customers navigate the complexity of digital transition, we can help them manage that complexity, improve efficiency and sustainability and remain license compliant. For example, one of the leading construction, civil, industrial and infrastructure service contractors in Vietnam invested in AEC collections and Autodesk Build to balance project safety, efficiency and quality while also reducing environmental impact and waste. Our license compliance team helped them identify licensing gaps and ensure installation of compliance software. We estimate that there are about 2 million noncompliant users within our paying customer base. 
During the quarter, we closed 11 deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, [ 6 ] of which were over $1 million. At the end of September, we will launch a new pay-as-you-go consumption model called Flex. It matches the customer's cost with their usage. Flex is an important new way to purchase from us as we evolve our business models to offer more choice and flexibility. It serves the long tail of customers who want an option for occasional users that do not use subscriptions every day. It also lowers the barrier to entry for existing and new users to explore new products with minimal risk and upfront costs. 
Now back to where I started. Sustained and purposeful innovation to digitally transform the industries we serve is also transforming our relationship with our customers from software vendor to strategic partner and enabling us to create more value for them through end-to-end cloud-based solutions, business model evolution and connected data and workflows. By helping our customers grow, we will grow, too. The pandemic has accelerated these trends, and climate change is increasing the urgency. We will continue to invest to rise to the challenges ahead and seize the opportunities they present. In the meantime, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal '23 goals. 
Please join us at our virtual Investor Day next week where we will have more time to share our strategic initiatives with you.

For billi",423,"It does. Thanks, Saket. Thanks for the question. So we're seeing overall strength in the business, and we continue to demonstrate discipline with our spend. So that's what's driving us to raise our guidance for revenue and margin for the year. 
For billings and free cash flow, I covered the specifics in the opening commentary. The key point to take away is this, we're focused on making changes that are good for our customers and good for us. And shifting more EBAs to annual billings helps us achieve that goal. Now it makes sense for customers because they retain price certainty by signing a multiyear contract. But by moving to annual billings, they get a more predictable annual cash outlay. 
Of course, the change is good for us, too. We generate more predictable annual cash flows, and we remove the discounts we see today to generate cash collections upfront. Most EBAs are already on annual billing terms. And also, we had already assumed that EBAs would all be on annual billing terms starting next year in our fiscal '23. We're making the change now because with the strong start to fiscal '22, we decided to get moving earlier to execute on the shift. But the overarching driver is that we're focused on optimizing our business, and the change, as we said, is good for both our customers and for us. 
As a side note, the impact to our billings guidance is also pretty small. It's around 1 percentage point of impact to the total billings outlook. 
Now if I shift attention to the ramp to fiscal '24, we do see accelerating momentum and multiple drivers of growth. Regarding multiyears, I want to break it down a bit. We have 2 main pools of multiyears, one for our EBAs and one for our base product subscription business. What I've talked about today so far is EBAs and the ongoing shift to annual billings for that cohort. As we look ahead to next year, as I mentioned in the opening commentary, we have a material cohort of multiyear contracts that are coming up for renewal in our base product subscription business. Renewing those contracts is one factor that drives us to $2.4 billion in cash flow next year. And year-to-date this year, the proportion of multiyear renewals that we're seeing in that cohort is in line with our expectations. So that, plus the strength in our top line year-to-date, gives us confidence in the path to the $2.4 billion free cash flow target next year."

Saket, specifically, what I did say was I said as we help our customers grow, we will grow. And the reason I want to highlight that particular point here is a lot of the things that are going on with regards to us growing with our customers is they're increasing investment in digitization. This is here to stay. It's continuing to accelerate. It's going to move forward next year and continue to accelerate. So the digitization engagement with our customers is why we grow as we help them grow because digitization is going to help them grow. It's going to help them be more responsive. It's going to help them win more business. It's going to help them do a whole bunch of things that they were struggling to do previously, which is great for them and great for us. 
Now the other thing I'd add there is we're also responding to the way they want to buy. I mean I think you've noticed that we introduced Flex. We haven't rolled it out yet. The customers can't yet buy it, but we introduced the concept of Flex. And Flex is something that a lot of our customers have been waiting for as we've been moving away from our old multiuser paradigm to single user. They've been waiting to see something that allows them to manage occasional use and maybe dive deeper into some of our more advanced digital technologies and integrate some of those things in the workflow. So we're going to offer them the flexibility they've been looking for, and we're going to mainstream it across a lot of our customer base in the mid-market. 
But the other piece I want to highlight about Flex, in particular, is that it's also a tool for reaching the long tail of our customers. Flex is going to allow us to not only help with smaller businesses that use some of our tools only a couple of times a month, but it's also going to help us with smaller customers or departments within larger customers that want to use a particular advanced tool on an occasional basis. It used to be back in the '90s when it looks like the long tail first came out that you'd attack the long tail with a set of discrete products, tons. You have tons of little products. The 2020 ways of approaching that is having a business model that allows people to get access to a set of capabilities in an ever-growing platform of products like what we're doing with Fusion. So look for those things, long term, can be important tools that we see forward. Things like Flex are not going to be short-term revenue drivers, but there'll be long-term ones there. 
Digitization is the key underlying thing here. Our business models and the way we're approaching some of our advanced platforms are the enablers that allow our customers to digitize faster."

This convergence piece between mechanical design and electrical design is something we've absolutely had our eye on for quite some time. As you know, we bought EAGLE several years back, and we have now tightly integrated it into the Fusion platform. And we're doing some very, very interesting things around automation and integration between electronic PCB design and the associated mechanical designs that either contain it or actually interact with it in a smart product. So we're already attacking that convergence organically with our products. 
You saw us look externally as well because we saw an opportunity to accelerate the industry change. We believe these processes are going to converge. We believe the leading-edge customers are going to be driving and using converged processes. And we saw a vision match out there, and we engaged in the discussion around accelerating this change in the market. We're still going after that market with Fusion, with EAGLE and the integration we have, and we're already moving up into the mid-market with some of these tools. So this is not going away. This is a continuing and ongoing place for us to focus and look for us to continually increase what we're doing with EAGLE to make those convergences between mechanical and electrical design more fluid, more integrated and, frankly, more automated."

So we're pretty confident that in the manufacturing side and the CAM side, we're doing a great job with Fusion, but we're also reaching deeper and deeper into people's entire process. A lot of the customers we're talking about publicly now are people that have rolled out Fusion across the entire process. And one of the things that's also exciting, you're seeing these large subscription counts, 11,000 again -- breaking 11,000 again this quarter. But one of the other exciting aspects here is that our billings growth is actually growing faster than our subs growth, which is a result of the new extension strategy, which is continually adding more and more advanced capability that people can buy on a pay-per-use basis or on a subscription basis to one of these extensions. So we're continuing to see really good traction with Fusion. We're continuing to roll out new extensions. You'll see more extensions coming out this year into next year. And you'll also see us start to do some interesting new things from a platform perspective with Fusion as well. So we're pretty bullish on Fusion. We feel pretty good about our position right here, and we're continuing to see growth. 
And you're right, I think the acquisition of Mastercam just shine the light on where the action is right now in the space."

It's significantly higher than the overall growth of the business in terms of new product subs, and it's continued to robustly grow moving forward, and we expect it to continue. So you can imagine that our volumes are getting back up to the places we would have expected them to be before COVID ever hit, which is a good sign and a good outcome. 
And more and more, as you can see in this quarter, we generated a lot of that new volume through digital direct channels and channels that were direct to us, which is another interesting factor here. You are absolutely right. It used to be that LT, because of the price point and because of its exposure to small businesses, it was a barometer of the health of our business. But the move to the subscription model has kind of scrambled that a little bit because people that may have been buying LT exclusively for something or buying different products and other things like that. So that's why we began tracking in a deep way the monthly active, daily active usage of our products in various countries, which has become, frankly, our core barometer. And I think you can agree that, that is a much more robust indicator of the health of our business than, for instance, looking at LT sales and LT transactions. 
And it's also interesting to note as commercial usage surges forward so as noncompliant usage, almost faster sometimes."

And you're right to talk about fab capacity for Intel and other places like that. BIM has matured to a point where when you combine it, especially not only with the capabilities of design and build, but ultimately, you'll see Tandem play a role in that space as well because Tandem is a digital twin, allows us to do a handover long term, not yet. Tandem is relatively new to market, but a digital handover to the owner for doing the lifetime management of the asset as well.

One, we do not have any impact from a federal infrastructure bill built into our financial models, okay? So the numbers we've given you, they're all business as usual based on our normal course and speak, right? So I want to be super clear about that, so we're all on the same page. However, we are big proponents of infrastructure spending and the need for infrastructure spending. And I think you're getting a sense -- just over the last few weeks and the last month, some of the critical drivers around what -- how serious it is when you have decaying infrastructure. 
I mean look at California, right? California built water infrastructure for slow snowmelts to catch water and have it dribble down from the melting snow and run off to the coast, and everybody was happy. That world is likely gone. And what people need to focus on is more reservoirs, different types of infrastructure to capture rainwater rather than rely on snowmelt. These are things that, in some cases, were predictable 10 years ago, but we haven't made progress on. 
Also, look what's happening in Tennessee just last week. These horrible tragedies with these flash floods in the middle of Tennessee, unprecedented levels of speed and severity of floods, all related to water infrastructure. All of these things are related to climate changes. Some of them were predictable. Some of them not. All of them are a 10-year backlog now in many places. We have to build better across the board. And we believe that our tools, our capabilities, the digital platforms we're deploying are going to help people build better. 
And when you look at how we're positioned to capitalize on this, which I can talk to you about, is, look, we have got the solution that goes from end to end with the owner -- with the capital planning engagement, all the way to the use engagement with the vertical and horizontal components of construction and BIM in between. 
And I want to point to you some of our recent partnerships and acquisitions. On road and rail, we partner with Aurigo to go after Departments of Transportation to help with the capital planning. We bought Innovyze, which has a capital planning tool upfront in the water infrastructure process. And we also have Spacemaker, which we haven't talked a lot about, which helps in the real estate development side from the capital planning and allocation there. So we're actually building out capabilities in the upfront through partnership and through technology. And then we have all this capability that we've integrated into the Construction Cloud as well to help with vertical and horizontal construction. So we're ready. 
We've invested in the places that we think are critical, and we think people need to invest in digital technology to not only build what needs to be build, but build it back better and build it back cheaper so that we can start closing out the backlog because there's a big backlog. So there will be opportunity here. It will be long-term opportunity for the company. It won't be short term, but there will absolutely be opportunity as people start to spin up these infrastructure projects."

I wanted to go back to manufacturing just with another question. You noted in prior calls that Fusion 360 is near a tipping point. And there was another question on MCAD and ECAD. I'm just curious, though, from a philosophical perspective, what's left for you to do within your manufacturing portfolio? In other words, is there a much more white space left beyond what you've got? Just sort of kind of getting a sense for where we're at in that sort of platform maturation."

I think one of the things that's really important in terms of things we have to do, we have to finish integrating all the end-to-end capabilities, all right? So we have to make sure that we've gotten all the capabilities completely integrated in a way that makes sense. We have to continue to dial down on things like generative design and cloud-based and machine learning-based automation that automate workflows between some of these things. So even less sophisticated companies can take full advantage of highly sophisticated capabilities, which is a goal for us. 
Now there's going to be other white space as we move down with regards to connecting to production planning on the shop floor, not just moving geometry directly to the machine through generative design, but actually managing production flow and some of the things associated with that in highly automated facilities. So we'll probably explore some of those areas as we start building out the platform. 
But really, in terms of what things have to happen to continue to accelerate Fusion's growth, it's all about building out the core design capabilities because we've got a lot of touch points in there. We've got ECAD. We've got some really great partnerships around simulation, which will deepen over time. And we've also got excellent manufacturing capabilities. As we deepen and professionalize the design capabilities, you'll start to see more and more purchasing of sophisticated extensions on top of Fusion. So look for Fusion to become a more significant revenue driver as we move beyond FY '23. 
Right now, we're focused on making sure the platform is best-in-class, that its cloud underpinnings are strong, that we build off the strong foundation we have right now and that we build out some of these core design capabilities. But there are little bits of white space in there around production management, around some of the integrations with other types of capabilities, around costing and estimating that are going to be interesting as well in the future."

There are some countries where we're getting very close to 50-50 and other places where we're very far away from it.

So we're building momentum, and we anticipate that the bulk of our EBA selling will be in the back half of this year, like previous years. So things are looking good there. 
On the e-commerce side, lots of growth there. We've been investing heavily. Last quarter, we talked about different things that we added like more out-of-seat capabilities, more calls-to-action across the site. We continue to invest this quarter. Some examples of the changes that we made were one-step resubscribe capabilities so that expired customers can easily resubscribe. We have even more places for out-of-seat capabilities throughout the site. We launched a new Middle East site in June. So a bunch of things. And you'll just see us incrementally add more functionality, more ways to engage with Autodesk so that it's easier to do business with us, and that's going to be part of our success to drive growth through that channel."

The only kind of nit piece that I would highlight in the back half of this year is that typically, in our Q4, we do see a bit more upfront revenue recognition for some of the products that we typically sell cyclically in that period.

I hope you and your families remain safe and healthy.  
As we anticipated when we set out our guidance at the beginning of the year, unwinding uncertainty resulted in increased business confidence, investment and economic growth during our second quarter. This is reflected in strong product usage, which returned to pre-COVID levels across the globe, increasing bid activity on BuildingConnected, which reached all-time highs, and greater channel partner confidence. When combined with strong execution, a resilient subscription business model and the continued secular shift to the cloud, our growth accelerated again in Q2 and generated further momentum.  
RPO and billings grew 24% and 29%, respectively, driven by strong new product subscription growth, renewal rates and revenue retention. I am proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year. And again, I thank all of our employees, their families, our partners and customers for their continued dedication, patience and commitment.

Several factors contributed to that strength, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales and improving subscription renewal rates.  
In addition, Innovyze and foreign exchange rate provided a modest tailwind to the quarter. Total revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 16% and 14% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 21%.  
Looking at revenue by product, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 12%. AEC revenue grew 21%, and manufacturing revenue grew 12%. Excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, manufacturing revenue grew in the mid-teens percent. M&E revenue grew 10%. Across the globe, revenue grew 14% in the Americas; 16% in EMEA; and 21% in APAC. Direct revenue increased 31% and represented 34% of our total revenue, up from 30% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce.  
As you'll hear more about at our Investor Day next week, about 3/4 of new customers to Autodesk are now generated through our digital channels, reflecting our efforts to enable a simplified buying experience.  
Our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, and our net revenue retention rate remains within the 100% to 110% range. Billings accelerated 29% to $1 billion, reflecting strong underlying demand and an easier comparison versus last year. Total deferred revenue grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Total RPO of $4.14 billion and current RPO of $2.85 billion both grew 24%. current RPO growth was driven by strong new product sales during the quarter and the ongoing benefit from the record number of EBAs signed in the second half of last year. Excluding the contribution from Innovyze, current RPO grew approximately 23%.  
Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while operating margin increased more than 2 percentage points to 31%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $186 million during the quarter, primarily driven by strong billings growth.  
Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continued to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. During the second quarter, we purchased 164,000 shares for $46 million at an average price of approximately $283 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 679,000 shares at an average price of approximately $278 per share for a total spend of $189 million.  
Now I'll turn to guidance. Consistent with previous quarters, we expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. We expect product subscription, volume and renewal rates to continue to be healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%.  
With our strong start to the year, we are raising the low end of our full year revenue guidance to a range of $4.345 billion to $4.385 billion, with a midpoint growth rate of 15% year-over-year. We are also raising our non-GAAP operating margin outlook to approximately 31%, an almost 2-point improvement from last year.  
Our strong start to the year means we're also shifting more of our EBA customers from multiyear paid upfront to annual billings, which is good for them and good for Autodesk. Our EBA customers retain price certainty with a multiyear contract term, but annual billings give them a more predictable annual cash outlay. For Autodesk, we generate more predictable cash flow and remove the discounts to generate upfront cash collections. While we had already assumed this change in fiscal '23, it has a modest impact on fiscal '22 billings and free cash flow. However, we expect it to drive more predictable free cash flow growth and better price realization over time, which will make Autodesk a more valuable company.  
The shift of more of our EBA customers from multiyear paid upfront to annual billings and FX account for the change in our fiscal '22 billings guidance and with a onetime M&A-related tax charge, our free cash flow guidance.  
As we look ahead, we're anticipating revenue growth to accelerate in Q3. Strong upfront revenues in Q4 last year, and with Vault now ratable, a smaller pool of nonratable products, create a tougher comparison in Q4 this year, which will reduce revenue growth a bit when compared to the third quarter. Also, our EBA strength in the second half of last year, including 2 of our largest ever deals in Q3, will impact RPO growth comparisons in the second half of our fiscal '22. The slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the third fiscal quarter and full year fiscal '22.  
As I shared last quarter, my initial focus after rejoining Autodesk was digging into our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals. The strength we've seen in fiscal '22, combined with a significant cohort of multiyear product subscription contracts that we expect will renew in fiscal '23, set us up nicely to achieve our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow goal.  
This past quarter, I turned my attention to our long-range financial plan, with a particular focus on fiscal '24 and beyond. You'll hear more at our Investor Day next week. But to set the stage today, our long-term strategic growth drivers and our flexible subscription business model give us confidence we can achieve our goal of sustainable double-digit revenue and free cash flow growth beyond fiscal '24. Now once we've achieved our fiscal '23 goals, we'll give you more details on our financial ambitions for fiscal '24 and beyond. But on the whole, we believe we have many exciting opportunities to drive growth by further expanding our addressable market into areas like construction and infrastructure as well as by deepening monetization of our user base. And we look forward to sharing more specifics with you at our Investor Day next week.  
Andrew, back to you."

Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve is changing our relationships with our customers from software vendor to strategic part",1592,"Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve is changing our relationships with our customers from software vendor to strategic partner. And that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and business model evolution. By helping our customers grow, we will grow too.  
In AEC, digitization trends are accelerating the need to connect all phases of design and construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions. A great example this quarter was with an Asia Pacific semiconductor manufacturer, which is rapidly expanding its manufacturing capacity around the world and looking for help to drive more efficient collaboration across project stakeholders as well as shorter design and delivery cycles. It invested in AEC collections to accomplish this goal and is now leveraging the power of BIM and our digital AEC workflows to achieve its expansion plan. This is a prime example of how Autodesk is positioned to help our customers as industries converge, with this customer being a long-time user of our manufacturing products and now expanding its footprint with us in AEC.  
In construction, we believe the Autodesk Construction Cloud is the best end-to-end offering across all phases of the construction life cycle. Starting with our industry-leading preconstruction offerings, we help our customers seamlessly convert data into a construction plan, allowing our customers to condition and coordinate models early to aiding clash detection, easily quantify the materials required for future construction and leverage our BuildingConnected community to power the bidding process.  
As we turn to the field, Autodesk Build provides a single integrated solution for project management, field collaboration, quality, safety and cost control, which is easy to deploy, adopt and use. We just launched it in February, but we're already -- we've already seen Autodesk Build in use on more than 11,000 customer projects around the world. By connecting project information and teams in one common data environment, it enables efficient collaboration while providing predictive analytics and insights that increase quality and safety while decreasing risk.  
As I mentioned earlier, we've transitioned to being a strategic partner to our customers. And in construction, that means evolving our business model. We provide customers more choice in how they buy. We offer both user and account-based pricing, which gives our customers the flexibility to decide how they want to engage with us on their digital journey. With our account-based pricing model, we're seeing significant benefits from driving as many users as possible to our construction platform.  
Once Autodesk Build has been deployed in a project, we've made it frictionless for anyone involved on the project to get access to our platform within minutes. This pattern is not unlike the evolution of Fusion 360 over the last few years. The more users we see on our platform, the more we learn, the better we make our products and the more value we add to our customers.  
This quarter, Messer Construction, a top ENR 400 general contractor in the United States, selected Autodesk Build for project management over competitive offerings, Pype for submittal management and BIM Collaborate for native class detection. As Andy Burg from Messer Construction said, ""Autodesk Build's comprehensive unified platform is industry-leading and, by seamlessly connecting design with construction to increase our efficiency, establishes a strong partnership foundation and further enables us to build better lives for our customers, communities and each other.""  
Autodesk Build's momentum is growing internationally, too. Stamhuis is a leading retail shop construction and renovation company in the Netherlands, which had already used AEC collections in generative design to optimize client retail space, reduced design and construction errors by 15% and improved its ROI by 10%. This quarter, it invested in Autodesk Build to further increase efficiency, reduce waste and add value for its clients by converging workflows from conceptual design to engineering and fabrication while seamlessly collaborating with its clients. Our relationship with Stamhuis demonstrates the value that digital construction processes can bring to customers around the world. With our significant international experience and resources, we're well positioned to capitalize on this large growth opportunity.  
And we continue to invest to connect and converge adjacent industries to create value and help our customers achieve greater efficiency. During the quarter, Innovyze's Info360 cloud platform launched a beta version of Info360 Asset, a cloud-based tool for the water industry's condition and performance monitoring and risk management processes. We also launched Autodesk Tandem, our digital twin offering focused on harnessing the data from the design and construction process to create a repeatable and dynamic process, with digital handover being the natural output of the project life cycle.  
Turning to manufacturing. We continue to see strong momentum with our manufacturing portfolio this quarter, and we also saw the inclusion of Upchain in its first enterprise business agreement, or EBA, with one of our larger enterprise accounts. The convergence of design and make is accelerating, and we are seeing larger companies expand on our platform. For example, after using Fusion 360 and Moldflow to develop accurate digital manufacturing trends for injection-molded parts, which is typically a very iterative, time-consuming and expensive process, one of the largest American multinational medical device and pharmaceutical companies renewed and expanded its EBA with us this quarter. They were able to significantly reduce the time and rework costs because they could anticipate, predict and correct manufacturing issues before moving in production.  
We continue to see subscription growth for Fusion 360 with paying subscriptions now at 165,000, and the Fusion 360 extensions are helping to increase our average revenue per subscriber and capture more potential opportunity. During the quarter, a U.S.-based global leader in design, engineering and manufacturing of woven wire mesh products transitioned to Fusion 360 as their main design tool and invested in our managed extension. The combination of Fusion 360 and managed extensions has largely automated their design and change workflows and has brought a new level of organization and efficiency on product design all the way through delivery.  
Our presence in education continues to expand to address the critical shortage in skilled labor. For example, a growing number of large German companies are replacing competitive solutions and are training their apprentices on Fusion 360 to prepare them for the future of work. In the second quarter, Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG, EnBW, one of the biggest utility companies in Germany with 25,000 employees, adopted Fusion 360 to train its 600 apprentices. EnBW and its apprentices will benefit from the Fusion 360 cloud collaboration platform serving all their CAD, CAM and CAE needs while they are either on-site or remote.  
Education remains an important market for us, and we continue to broaden our reach with more than 43 million Tinkercad and Fusion 360 education users. We continue to make progress transitioning all of our users to named users, giving customers more visibility into their usage data and allowing us to better serve our paying customers while also making it harder for noncompliant users to access our software.  
The [ Level ] group is a full cycle developer, which specializes in business class complexes. During the quarter, it increased its investment with Autodesk by consolidating all of its single and multiuser subscriptions and permanent licenses to AEC Collections with our premium plan and Autodesk Docs to enable more efficient collaboration and license management. And with the help of 24/7 technical support and single sign-on capability, [ Level ] group expects reduced design costs in the future.  
As our existing paying customers navigate the complexity of digital transition, we can help them manage that complexity, improve efficiency and sustainability and remain license-compliant. For example, one of the leading construction, civil, industrial and infrastructure service contractors in Vietnam invested in AEC collections and Autodesk Build to balance project safety, efficiency and quality while also reducing environmental impact and waste. Our license compliance team helped them identify licensing gaps and ensure installation of compliance software. We estimate that there are about 2 million noncompliant users within our paying customer base.  
During the quarter, we closed 11 deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, 6 of which were over $1 million. At the end of September, we will launch a new pay-as-you-go consumption model called Flex. It matches the customer's cost with their usage. Flex is an important new way to purchase from us as we evolve our business models to offer more choice and flexibility. It serves the long tail of customers who want an option for occasional users that do not use subscriptions every day. It also lowers the barrier to entry for existing and new users to explore new products with minimal risk and upfront costs.  
Now back to where I started. Sustained and purposeful innovation to digitally transform the industries we serve is also transforming our relationship with our customers from software vendor to strategic partner and enabling us to create more value for them through end-to-end cloud-based solutions, business model evolution and connected data and workflows. By helping our customers grow, we will grow, too. The pandemic has accelerated these trends, and climate change is increasing the urgency. We will continue to invest to rise to the challenges ahead and seize the opportunities they present. In the meantime, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal '23 goals.  
Please join us at our virtual Investor Day next week where we will have more time to share our strategic initiatives with you.

So that's what's driving us to raise our guidance for revenue and margin for the year. 
For billings and free cash flow, I covered the specifics in the opening commentary. The key point to take away is this, we're focused on making changes that are good for our customers and good for us. And shifting more EBAs to annual billings helps us achieve that goal. Now it makes sense for customers because they retain price certainty by signing a multiyear contract. But by moving to annual billings, they get a more predictable annual cash outlay. 
Of course, the change is good for us, too. We generate more predictable annual cash flows, and we remove the discounts we see today to generate cash collections upfront. Most EBAs are already on annual billing terms. And also, we had already assumed that EBAs would all be on annual billing terms starting next year in our fiscal '23. We're making the change now because with the strong start to fiscal '22, we decided to get moving earlier to execute on the shift. But the overarching driver is that we're focused on optimizing our business, and the change, as we said, is good for both our customers and for us. 
As a side note, the impact to our billings guidance is also pretty small. It's around 1 percentage point of impact to the total billings outlook. 
Now if I shift attention to the ramp to fiscal '24, we do see accelerating momentum and multiple drivers of growth. Regarding multiyears, I want to break it down a bit. We have 2 main pools of multiyears, one for our EBAs and one for our base product subscription business. What I've talked about today so far is EBAs and the ongoing shift to annual billings for that cohort. As we look ahead to next year, as I mentioned in the opening commentary, we have a material cohort of multiyear contracts that are coming up for renewal in our base product subscription business. Renewing those contracts is one factor that drives us to $2.4 billion in cash flow next year. And year-to-date this year, the proportion of multiyear renewals that we're seeing in that cohort is in line with our expectations. So that, plus the strength in our top line year-to-date, gives us confidence in the path to the $2.4 billion free cash flow target next year."

Saket, specifically, what I did say was I said as we help our customers grow, we will grow. And the reason I want to highlight that particular point here is a lot of the things that are going on with regards to us growing with our customers is they're increasing investment in digitization. This is here to stay. It's continuing to accelerate. It's going to move forward next year and continue to accelerate. So the digitization engagement with our customers is why we grow as we help them grow because digitization is going to help them grow. It's going to help them be more responsive. It's going to help them win more business. It's going to help them do a whole bunch of things that they were struggling to do previously, which is great for them and great for us. 
Now the other thing I'd add there is we're also responding to the way they want to buy. I mean I think you've noticed that we introduced Flex. We haven't rolled it out yet. The customers can't yet buy it, but we introduced the concept of Flex. And Flex is something that a lot of our customers have been waiting for as we've been moving away from our old multiuser paradigm to single user. They've been waiting to see something that allows them to manage occasional use and maybe dive deeper into some of our more advanced digital technologies and integrate some of those things in the workflow. So we're going to offer them the flexibility they've been looking for, and we're going to mainstream it across a lot of our customer base in the mid-market. 
But the other piece I want to highlight about Flex, in particular, is that it's also a tool for reaching the long tail of our customers. Flex is going to allow us to not only help with smaller businesses that use some of our tools only a couple of times a month, but it's also going to help us with smaller customers or departments within larger customers that want to use a particular advanced tool on an occasional basis. It used to be back in the '90s when it looks like the long tail first came out that you'd attack the long tail with a set of discrete products. Tons -- you have tons of little products. The 2020 ways of approaching that is having a business model that allows people to get access to a set of capabilities in an ever-growing platform of products like what we're doing with Fusion. So look for those things, long term, can be important tools that we see forward. Things like Flex are not going to be short-term revenue drivers, but there'll be long-term ones there. 
Digitization is the key underlying thing here. Our business models and the way we're approaching some of our advanced platforms are the enablers that allow our customers to digitize faster."

This convergence piece between mechanical design and electrical design is something we've absolutely had our eye on for quite some time. As you know, we bought EAGLE several years back, and we have now tightly integrated it into the Fusion platform. And we're doing some very, very interesting things around automation and integration between electronic PCB design and the associated mechanical designs that either contain it or actually interact with it in a smart product. So we're already attacking that convergence organically with our products. 
You saw us look externally as well because we saw an opportunity to accelerate the industry change. We believe these processes are going to converge. We believe the leading-edge customers are going to be driving and using converged processes. And we saw a vision match out there, and we engaged in the discussion around accelerating this change in the market. We're still going after that market with Fusion, with EAGLE and the integration we have, and we're already moving up into the mid-market with some of these tools. So this is not going away. This is a continuing and ongoing place for us to focus and look for us to continually increase what we're doing with EAGLE to make those convergences between mechanical and electrical design more fluid, more integrated and, frankly, more automated."

And I think you can kind of see that the business was not growing as, say, robustly as, say, Fusion is growing, both from a user and billing standpoint. So we're pretty confident that in the manufacturing side and the CAM side, we're doing a great job with Fusion, but we're also reaching deeper and deeper into people's entire process. A lot of the customers we're talking about publicly now are people that have rolled out Fusion across the entire process. 
And one of the things that's also exciting, you're seeing these large subscription counts, 11,000 again -- breaking 11,000 again this quarter. But one of the other exciting aspects here is that our billings growth is actually growing faster than our subs growth, which is a result of the new extension strategy, which is continually adding more and more advanced capability that people can buy on a pay-per-use basis or on a subscription basis to one of these extensions. So we're continuing to see really good traction with Fusion. We're continuing to roll out new extensions. You'll see more extensions coming out this year into next year. 
And you'll also see us start to do some interesting new things from a platform perspective with Fusion as well. So we're pretty bullish on Fusion. We feel pretty good about our position right here, and we're continuing to see growth. And you're right, I think the acquisition of Mastercam just shine the light on where the action is right now in the space."

And then similarly, for many years, LT was considered to be a good leading indicator or a barometer of the business.

It's significantly higher than the overall growth of the business in terms of new product subs, and it's continued to robustly grow moving forward, and we expect it to continue. So you can imagine that our volumes are getting back up to the places we would have expected them to be before COVID ever hit, which is a good sign and a good outcome. 
And more and more, as you can see in this quarter, we generated a lot of that new volume through digital direct channels and channels that were direct to us, which is another interesting factor here. You are absolutely right. It used to be that LT, because of the price point and because of its exposure to small businesses, it was a barometer of the health of our business. But the move to the subscription model has kind of scrambled that a little bit because people that may have been buying LT exclusively for something or buying different products and other things like that. 
So that's why we began tracking in a deep way the monthly active, daily active usage of our products in various countries, which has become, frankly, our core barometer.

So we are actively engaged with deepening the penetration of BIM in all of those areas where people are standing up new factories. 
And people are building new capacity. And you're right to talk about fab capacity for Intel and other places like that. BIM has matured to a point where when you combine it, especially not only with the capabilities of design and build, but ultimately, you'll see Tandem play a role in that space as well because Tandem as a digital twin, allows us to do a handover long term, not yet. Tandem is relatively new to market, but a digital handover to the owner for doing the lifetime management of the asset as well. 
So look, that pipeline is robust and strong. We're already a big player in data center and new style factory standups in several sectors."

So I can't give you specifics, but here's one of the things -- here's what I can tell you, and here's the philosophical statement I can make on this. One, we do not have any impact from a federal infrastructure bill built into our financial models, okay? So the numbers we've given you, they're all business as usual based on our normal course and speed, right? So I want to be super clear about that, so we're all on the same page. However, we are big proponents of infrastructure spending and the need for infrastructure spending. And I think you're getting a sense -- just over the last few weeks and the last month, some of the critical drivers around what -- how serious it is when you have decaying infrastructure. 
I mean look at California, right? California built water infrastructure for slow snowmelts to catch water and have it dribble down from the melting snow and run off to the coast, and everybody was happy. That world is likely gone. And what people need to focus on is more reservoirs, different types of infrastructure to capture rainwater rather than rely on snowmelt. These are things that, in some cases, were predictable 10 years ago, but we haven't made progress on. 
Also, look what's happening in Tennessee just last week. These horrible tragedies with these flash floods in the middle of Tennessee, unprecedented levels of speed and severity of floods, all related to water infrastructure. All of these things are related to climate changes. Some of them were predictable. Some of them not. All of them are a 10-year backlog now in many places. We have to build better across the board. And we believe that our tools, our capabilities, the digital platforms we're deploying are going to help people build better. 
And when you look at how we're positioned to capitalize on this, which I can talk to you about, is, look, we have got the solution that goes from end to end with the owner -- with the capital planning engagement, all the way to the use engagement with the vertical and horizontal components of construction and BIM in between. 
And I want to point to you some of our recent partnerships and acquisitions. On road and rail, we partner with Aurigo to go after departments of transportation to help with the capital planning. We bought Innovyze, which has a capital planning tool upfront in the water infrastructure process. And we also have Spacemaker, which we haven't talked a lot about, which helps in the real estate development side from the capital planning and allocation there. So we're actually building out capabilities in the upfront through partnership and through technology. And then we have all this capability that we've integrated into the Construction Cloud as well to help with vertical and horizontal construction. So we're ready. 
We've invested in the places that we think are critical, and we think people need to invest in digital technology to not only build what needs to be built, but build it back better and build it back cheaper so that we can start closing out the backlog because there's a big backlog. So there will be opportunity here. It will be long-term opportunity for the company. It won't be short term, but there will absolutely be opportunity as people start to spin up these infrastructure projects."

I wanted to go back to manufacturing just with another question. You noted in prior calls that Fusion 360 is near a tipping point. And there was another question on MCAD and ECAD. I'm just curious, though, from a philosophical perspective, what's left for you to do within your manufacturing portfolio? In other words, is there a much more white space left beyond what you've got? Just sort of kind of getting a sense for where we're at in that sort of platform maturation."

I think one of the things that's really important in terms of things we have to do, we have to finish integrating all the end-to-end capabilities, all right? So we have to make sure that we've gotten all the capabilities completely integrated in a way that makes sense. We have to continue to dial down on things like generative design and cloud-based and machine learning-based automation that automate workflows between some of these things. So even less sophisticated companies can take full advantage of highly sophisticated capabilities, which is a goal for us. 
Now there's going to be other white space as we move down with regards to connecting to production planning on the shop floor, not just moving geometry directly to the machine through generative design, but actually managing production flow and some of the things associated with that in highly automated facilities. So we'll probably explore some of those areas as we start building out the platform. 
But really, in terms of what things have to happen to continue to accelerate Fusion's growth, it's all about building out the core design capabilities because we've got a lot of touch points in there. We've got ECAD. We've got some really great partnerships around simulation, which will deepen over time. And we've also got excellent manufacturing capabilities. As we deepen and professionalize the design capabilities, you'll start to see more and more purchasing of sophisticated extensions on top of Fusion. So look for Fusion to become a more significant revenue driver as we move beyond FY '23. 
Right now, we're focused on making sure the platform is best-in-class, that its cloud underpinnings are strong, that we build off the strong foundation we have right now and that we build out some of these core design capabilities. But there are little bits of white space in there around production management, around some of the integrations with other types of capabilities, around costing and estimating that are going to be interesting as well in the future."

On the e-commerce side, lots of growth there. We've been investing heavily. Last quarter, we talked about different things that we added like more out-of-seat capabilities, more calls-to-action across the site. We continued to invest this quarter. Some examples of the changes that we made were one-step resubscribe capabilities so that expired customers can easily resubscribe. We have even more places for out-of-seat capabilities throughout the site. We launched a new Middle East site in June. So a bunch of things.

Our third quarter results were strong, driven by one of our best ever quarters for new subscriptions, record subscription renewal rates, a net revenue retention rate towards the high end of our range and a solid competitive performance. We also grew RPO and billings 18% and 16%, respectively, despite a tougher compare versus last year. Relative to the first and second quarters, the rate of improvement decelerated during the third quarter more than we expected. While demand is robust, we believe supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures. A global labor shortage, making it harder for our customers to staff new projects and the ebb and flow of COVID are contributing to the deceleration as well as documented country-specific disruption to AEC in China. 
Our conversation with customers and channel partners reinforce our viewing. We're encouraged that embracing digital transformation to drive efficiency and sustainability remains a priority for our customers. Our end-to-end solutions, business model flexibility and platform position us well competitively and enable more customers to enter and remain in our ecosystem. As you heard at our recent Investor Day University, we are rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to increase and realize the opportunity ahead. Notable milestones during the quarter included the launch of our Flex consumption model and our plans to combine technologies, connect processes, automate workflows and unlock valuable insights for customers through our Forge platform. 
The recent report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the United Nations Climate Change 26 meeting in Glasgow, both underscore the urgency of reducing carbon and earth atmosphere and the role that everyone, including corporations needs to play. Sustainability needs to be designed, made and in many cases, retrofitted in construction and manufacturing. This cannot be achieved efficiently or effectively without end-to-end software like ours to drive the process. This organizing principle effects not just how we deploy capital, for example, through our investments to develop sustainable tools and our recent acquisition of Innovyze, but also how we source capital. Many of our largest equity holders already aligned to our sustainability goals. In the third quarter, we began to align our debt holders by issuing our first sustainability bond linked to our sustainability goals. 
Now let me turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives."

As Andrew said, our third quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, rapidly expanding digital sales and increasing subscription renewal rates. Total revenue grow",1027,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, our third quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, rapidly expanding digital sales and increasing subscription renewal rates. Total revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 18% and 17% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 21%. Looking at revenue by product. The growth we saw was broad-based. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 14%. AEC revenue grew 22% and manufacturing revenue grew 16%, M&E revenue grew 17%. Across the globe, revenue grew 18% in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 18% in APAC. 
Direct revenue increased 34% and represented 35% of our total revenue, up from 31% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. As you heard at our Investor Day, about 3/4 of new customers Autodesk are now generated through our digital channels, reflecting the strength of our simplified buying experiences. Our product subscription renewal rates reached record highs, and our net revenue retention rate was toward the high end of our 100% to 110% range. Billings increased 16% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand and a tough comparison versus last year when we signed 2 of our largest ever EBAs including a 9-digit deal. 
Total deferred revenue grew 14% to $3.3 billion. Total RPO of $4.2 billion and current RPO of $2.9 billion grew 18% and 21%, respectively. Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-GAAP operating margin increased by 2 percentage points to approximately 32%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $257 million during the quarter against a tough comparison from last year which benefited from pandemic-related payment term extensions. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from our equity plans. 
During the third quarter, we purchased 980,000 shares for $287 million at an average price of approximately $293 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.66 million shares at an average price of approximately $287 per share for total spend of $476 million. Looking forward, as Andrew said, we're rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to realize the opportunities ahead. As we discussed last quarter, the shift of multiyear contracts to annual billings as we move into fiscal '24 will drive more predictable free cash flow and better price realization over time, which will make Autodesk a more valuable company. This quarter, we took steps to optimize our capital structure by issuing our first sustainability bonds, which aligns our capital strategy with our sustainability goals, while also extending our debt maturity profile by almost 2 years and reducing our weighted average cost of debt by 40 basis points. 
As we enter Q4, we intend to take steps to reduce our real estate footprint because the pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work and we moved to a hybrid workforce. As a result, we anticipate we will reduce the square footage of our facilities portfolio by approximately 20% worldwide and that we will take a GAAP-only charge of up to approximately $180 million. The bulk of which will be recognized over the next several months as we execute our plans. Optimizing our facilities costs will allow us to better deploy capital to further our strategy and drive growth. Now let me finish with guidance. Demand was robust in Q3, and we expect it to remain so in Q4. However, as Andrew said, macroeconomic headwinds, such as supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of COVID and AEC in China are impacting the pace of our recovery. 
As an example, the growth in new product subscription volumes decelerated from approximately 30% in the first half to mid-20s percent in Q3, which is more than normal seasonality and a tougher comparison versus last year would suggest. This dynamic drove strong billings growth in Q3 that nonetheless, fell short of our expectations. In light of this macroeconomic uncertainty, as we enter Q4, we're taking a pragmatic approach and are assuming that the supply chain, labor, COVID and country-specific challenges will persist. As a result, we're reducing the midpoint of our billings and free cash flow guidance by approximately $150 million and $100 million, respectively, for full year fiscal '22. Given the nature of our subscription business model and the greater degree of near-term visibility it provides to us and our expectation of continued strong spend discipline, the midpoint of our full year revenue and margin guidance is broadly unchanged. 
We continue to target $2.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal '23 in constant currency because we believe the current macro headwinds we're seeing are transient. But if the growth deceleration and strengthened dollar continue through next year, we could see potential risk to that target of about $100 million to $200 million based on what we know today. FX volatility is a big factor. Rate moves in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. Since then and in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow. We're obviously watching FX rates closely, but it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. 
Beyond cash flow, if you further take the risk into account, revenue growth could end up at the low end of the CAGR we talked about at Investor Day. And fiscal '23 margin could be impacted by about 1 point. We will, of course, update you on our next earnings call when we expect to have more visibility into any impact from macro or FX movements on our fiscal '23 outlook. We remain optimistic about our growth potential beyond fiscal '23, continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margins in the 38% to 40% range and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. These metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. Andrew, back to you."

Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic par",1323,"Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic partner, and that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and through business model evolution. Our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals, from architecture and engineering through construction owners and from product engineering to product manufacturing and product and data life cycle management. By helping our customers grow and navigate their digital transformation, we will grow, too. 
For example, Construction and are leading construction and infrastructure firms based in France with over 100,000 construction employees operating in 60 countries across the globe. In the third quarter, they significantly increased their commitment to Autodesk products such as Revit, AutoCAD and Civil 3D following an accelerated move to BIM and digital workflows over the last 3 years, which significantly increased monthly average users. Similarly, Corporation, one of the largest construction firms in Japan, which operates in 16 countries worldwide, is accelerating its global consolidation around BIM and a unified 3D technology platform to enable greater efficiency and sustainability. 
In the third quarter, it expanded the with us. Over the last 2 years, it has more than doubled the number of Revit users and expanded its usage of Autodesk Construction Cloud to connect workflows from design through construction. We are further extending our reach into the construction mid-market with the recent launch of Introduction of an account-based pricing business model and distribution through our channel partners. For example, this quarter, Jacobson Construction Company, an ENR 400 general contractor in the United States, was looking for a long-term technology partner and to consolidate around a single project management solution that would increase the efficiency of its field teams, while also seamlessly integrating with its accounting solution. 
While it previously used a competitor solution for some projects, Jacobson ultimately chose Autodesk Construction Cloud because Autodesk builds robust field and cost management functionality, and the opportunity to integrate it smoothly with existing technology. With new Autodesk build features and capability launched every 2 months or so and the recently launched ACC bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. We're connecting the infrastructure, too. For example, the administrator of railway infrastructure in Spain or ADIF selected Autodesk products over competitor offerings to support its digital transformation. 
Backed by our common data environment, ADIF will leverage the Autodesk Construction Cloud to collaborate on project information, on-site development and model coordination to ensure efficient and accurate construction of their railway network. Infrastructure remains an important opportunity for Autodesk across the globe. Our end-to-end solutions, which boosts the efficiency and sustainability of customers like ADIF as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate vertical and horizontal design and construction give us a competitive advantage. Much needed additional investment in infrastructure in the United States and across the globe will restore aging infrastructure and increase the productivity of the economy. Perhaps more consequentially in the long term, provisions in the U.S. infrastructure bill which encourages Department of Transportation to digitize their processes should accelerate adoption of digital workflows and enable all infrastructure investment to become more efficient and sustainable. 
Turning to manufacturing. We sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter. In automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing and connected factories, as automotive OEMs seek to break down work silos at shorten handoff and design cycles. Ford, one of the largest automotive OEMs in the world renewed and expanded its EBA with Autodesk during the third quarter, growing users in and in design and AutoCAD inventor and Navisworks in manufacturing, while adding Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Build in facilities and manufacturing to enable field access to plant drawings during maintenance and operations and equipment changeover. 
Fusion 360 commercial subscribers again grew strongly without any systematic sales promotion, ending the quarter with 175,000 subscribers. While still early days, our new extensions, including machining, design and nesting and fabrication are performing well, and there is major interest in our upcoming simulation and design extensions. Fewer promotions and growing demand for Fusion 360 extensions are enabling us to capture more of the potential market opportunity and accelerate our growth. Fast Radius is a leading digital manufacturing and supply chain company. The company's proprietary cloud manufacturing platform combines software and advanced micro factories enable its customers to flexibly design, make and move certified products. 
Fast Radius already uses several Autodesk products. This quarter, it added Fusion 360 with a machining extension to support its in-house CNC operation and integrated alongside its existing additive manufacturing offering. Fusion 360 enables Fast Radius to program a wide variety of parts more quickly, resulting in faster product cycle times. Outside of commercial use, there is a large and rapidly growing ecosystem of users that are taking Fusion 360 from education and into the workplace. These will fuel commercial usage in the future. As 1 measure of this ecosystem, we ended the third quarter with 1 million monthly active users, up over 50% year-over-year, and they are doing some amazing work. 
On September 12, the Technical University of Munich, team beat more than 400 applicants and 12 finalists to win the inaugural not a boring competition. As 1 of the 5 leads responsible for project operations said ""Fusion 360's cloud-based solution enables our 60-member team to collaborate remotely during the pandemic and design and build an award-winning 40-foot long, 22-ton tunneling machine. Throughout the year, we were repeatedly told by industry experts that the time line we were aiming for was borderline impossible. The Fusion 360 ease-of-use and integrated CAD, CAM and SEM enable rapid simulation and improve the speed and efficiency of the design workflow."" And finally, we continue to enable more users to participate in our ecosystem more productively through business model innovation and our license compliance initiatives. 
For example, a sustainable building engineering design solutions consultant in Australia, which has been an Autodesk AEC customer for more than a decade, added our premium offering in the third quarter to enable it to better manage its subscriptions and provide more secure single sign-on across multiple offices. Across Autodesk, the number of premium subscribers increased more than 500% year-over-year. And in the Middle East, large telecoms company undertaking its own digital transformation with seeking to increase efficiency and sustainability by adopting BIM standards and streamlining digital workflows, while also ensuring license compliance across a fragmented employee base. 
During the process, we become the trusted partner of choice, resulting in a significant investment in AEC Collections, AutoCAD, Revit and 3ds Max. Year-to-date, license compliance billings across Autodesk as a whole are up 20% when compared to the same period 2 years ago and almost 50% year-over-year. In speaking with customers, partners and employees, we are very optimistic about the future. They have demonstrated grit and determination, inspiration and innovation and agility and transformation during the pandemic. And while there will certainly be twist and turns on the road ahead, in many ways, the pandemic has accelerated the future and increased my confidence that we are on the right path. We are executing well in challenging times and believe we have only significant opportunities ahead of us. 
I am reminded again that Autodesk's purpose has never been more important or urgent, empowering innovators with design and make technology so that they can achieve the new possible also enable them to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably. Together, we can meet the challenges posed by carbon, water and waste, while also advancing equity and access to the in-demand skills of the future. Autodesk's central role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future.

So first off, Saket, let's make sure we all kind of level set on the business is strong. You saw the numbers. We're seeing tremendous growth. We're seeing record renewal rates. We're approaching net revenue retention rates at the high end of our guide, and they're continuing to go up. That's super important here, and we feel pretty good about where the business is going. So the business is strong, and we're seeing a lot of strength there. If you look at what we're talking about here, we saw several things happened during the quarter, and we got this reinforced by our customers and by our channel partners. We saw deceleration in what we were seeing around monthly active usage and all things associated with that. And that then translated into to us kind of looking at our guide and looking at things going forward, and we pragmatically just assumed at this point that what we saw in the quarter is going to continue into Q4. And that's what you're seeing a pragmatic assessment that, this kind of supply chain pressure, this inflationary pressure that's kind of squeezing the margins of some of our customers is going to continue into Q4. If we look forward in terms of the guide in terms of what's going on into next year, look, we assume 2 things. One, this interesting FX environment we're in, which I want Debbie to kind of comment on again and kind of reinforce some of the things you said in the opening commentary, presents some potential risk. So we want to flag those risks. In addition, if some of these supply chain issues bleed over into the beginning of next year, we wanted to flag some additional risk there, but there's certainly a large currency headwind that we're seeing. And I'd like Debbie to just kind of reiterate some of the things you said in the opening commentary, so we can all get on the same page about that."

And that is that for our new volume growth, we saw a 30% growth for the first half of fiscal '22; and then in Q3, it was in the mid-20s. So it was still very strong growth. It just fell short of our expectations. As we look ahead, we did highlight the potential risks that we see to fiscal '23 free cash flow. And it's true that FX, based on what we know today, is a big factor. It's been highly volatile. The rate moves that we saw in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. And since then and in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow. So as you can imagine, we're obviously watching FX rates closely. But it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. Our goal today was just to highlight the risk as we look ahead to next year.

We don't have any infrastructure uplift built in any of our guidance or anything that we're talking about right now, okay? These things play out over multiple years. This is a great bill.

These things play out over multiple years. This is a great bill. We're really happy to see it. Included in the bill is a $100 million fund to accelerate investment in digital tools for Department of Transportation. We feel that that's a good thing and it's an important part of this bill from our perspective because it's going to change the ecosystem. But these things play out over a long term. We're certainly really happy about the fact that we have invested in water ahead of these critical investments in infrastructure because water is going to matter a lot. Clean water, water management in terms of flooding or storage of water, wastewater processing, all these things, water is going to be a big deal. So we're going to see our engagement in water projects probably increase over the next couple of years. But I want to make sure that we're all clear that we don't build these into our numbers right now, and we want to -- we're going to wait and see how these things play out over the next couple of years, but we will absolutely see some of our investments in road, rail and water pay off over a multiyear period here. And we're pretty excited about it. This bill was a long time coming. And I think the emphasis on digital transformation inside the infrastructure industry is going to be an important catalyst to modernizing and expanding what's happening in our infrastructure and growth in the United States."

So let's look kind of like back up to 3 months ago, I set some of the context too, so that we kind of get a sense for this. So 3 months ago, we were heading into the quarter seeing strong renewal rates, projecting strong renewal rates heading in, we saw those strong renewal rates. We're at record renewal rates. We're continuing to see those things. We also saw monthly active usage increasing robustly heading into the quarter. As the quarter progressed, that increase in monthly active usage decelerated a little bit. It continued to grow. It's just the second derivative kind of went negative on us, and it didn't continue to accelerate at the pace we expected to see. So what's driving that? For a lot of our customers, the book of business they're seeing is robust. They have more demand than they're actually able to fulfill on right now. And you can see it in all the indices and all the indicators. What you also saw during the quarter, these supply chain backlogs and these inflationary pressures peaked in the quarter and continued persistently throughout the quarter. So while they have this big book of business, or they have existing ongoing projects, if you're on the AEC side and say you're on a fixed bid contract, you're going to see margin pressure because your cost of goods to deliver the project that you're working on is going up, as is your cost of labor and actually your labor pool is tight and constrained. So you're seeing all these factors increase -- your margins, and it's affecting your buying behavior at some time. So even in this environment, where we saw all of these forces, including the labor shortages and things associated with that, we actually continued to grow robustly, just not where we expected to. Now if you're on the manufacturing side, which you noticed we did very well and especially relative to our competitors. Even there, they're not able to fulfill on all of the demand they have heading into their businesses. So they're not collecting cash as fast because they're not shipping the products that they're getting ordered from their customers. So all of these things are playing out. It do stop people from buying technology, but it certainly slowed down some of the activity relative to our expectations around people buying and investing in their technology portfolio. Does that make sense?"

Also, a lot of these things we've been talking about with regards to supply chain pressures, our view is pretty transient by us. These are not going to be persistent types of things.

In fact, like I said, the second change it eat over a little bit. So these predictors, these tracking mechanisms we have, I think our still valid. They're powerful. They actually gave us indications of things that were going on. I think we're also, frankly, tracking the inflationary environment a bit more right now, trying to make sure what's happening with the goods and labor pool that our customers are engaging with. We're going to be paying attention to that. There's hopeful signs out there, that some of this is loosening up in some respects, but we're going to be watching that. Now with regards with some of the business coming back, it is absolutely possible that that's the case. Our customers are definitely looking at a backlog of projects and a backlog of orders and all the things associated with that. I think it's prudent at this point for us to kind of -- with the information we have right now, assume that we're just going to see kind of an ongoing kind of impact for these things until something changes. But it is possible that some of this could come back as a result of releasing pressure. But it's not. I don't think it's prudent right now to declare that.

We're just prudently assuming that what we saw in Q3 continues into Q4 because based on what we wanted to see was like this uplift in monthly active usage at a higher rate than what we saw, it's probably a safe bet to just assume this is going to into Q4. If something changes, if these pressures start to relieve and start to relax, we could absolutely see an improving environment. But the business is strong. The renewal rates are strong, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. The net tension revenue rates are strong. The slowdown was rather broad except for the country-specific issues that we highlighted in China. So there was no 1 product area that saw a slowing. But I want you to note something pretty important here. Look at the competitive position that we came out of this year, particularly in manufacturing and other places. We're growing much more robustly than any of our competition in the space. It's just we have high expectations and we wanted to see some of those high expectations fulfilled.

And what that does is it shows a strong -- a kind of a strong affinity and willingness to keep upping their game with regards to our products and offering. And that does not often, okay? If anything, that's continuing to strengthen. So that feels really good. So there's really -- it really was affecting the new book of business, which kind of bleeds into the long tail of our business at some point into some level, which is to be expected in environments like this. Those who are most cash flow constrained, tend to slow their buying down the most. So I don't see any bleed over potential. In fact, in a lot of our newer businesses, we saw robust growth associated with some of these things. So I do not see a crossover or a bleed over between these things. In fact, we continue to expect continued strengthening of net revenue retention rates in the base."

This was addressed at the Investor Day as maybe being a risk area, but also an opportunity perhaps for technology adoption. Even recently, it seems like engineering firms are acknowledging that hiring support bigger backlogs might be tough, but technology, again, could be an opportunity. So I guess the question is, how do you think about the new seat contribution for your growth algorithm in the context of double digits being sustainable? Would you expect a bigger contribution from the application and content side of the growth model and how to think about seats, given the current macro backdrop?"
119902,1687074169,2447840,"Autodesk, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So we absolutely think that we continue to see digitization tailwinds here. Customers are absolutely turning to technology to wrestle with some of these problems and solve some of these things. And if you look at the strategy around double-digit grow",539,"Yes. So we absolutely think that we continue to see digitization tailwinds here. Customers are absolutely turning to technology to wrestle with some of these problems and solve some of these things. And if you look at the strategy around double-digit growth and where we're going, you see a lot of things working. First off, let's just pause and I don't want to say this too many times, but the business is doing strong and that's setting a floor on some of our growth. Also, I wanted you to notice some of the things that happened with noncompliant revenue. We grew 50% year-over-year, reflecting the compare to kind of the slowdown we did in the COVID in the 2020 and around the pandemic, and we normalize the kind of like a 20-year -- 20% growth over the 2-year period, which shows nice steady growth in some of these things. So if you look at the business, you see a lot of things working really well. Now if you look at the long-term trends that are going to contribute and be additive in terms of driving the double-digit growth, the digitization is there, the tailwinds continue, customers are telling us more and more, they want to go deeper, deeper, deeper in digitization. And we're seeing strong adoption like for instance in construction with our largest EBA customers and some of our largest GCs. We're seeing strong adoption of Construction Cloud or integrating Construction Cloud more deeply into some of these relationships. If you look at some of the incremental drivers we were talking about with regards to business model capabilities and some of the things associated we're continuing to see strong growth there in terms of new types of subscription models, noncompliant users. And then when we talk about the long tail. While it's really early days with the Flex model, and I want to make sure that we always say it's early days with the Flex model. One of the things we're seeing with Flex is exactly what we expected to see. We're seeing a large percent of Flex business coming in is net new. Another chunk of Flex business coming in as these occasional usage buyers. People that classically bought network licenses previously. And another chunk of business where people trying and using more advanced products, products they weren't going to use previously. Those trends are exactly the kind of trends we want to see with offerings like this. And as time goes on and we get more experience with Flex, we expect those trends to continue. So all of the things that we're pursuing to drive double-digit growth are working right now. And that's what gives us confidence as we move forward into the FY '23, '24 and '25 and beyond, is that everything we're doing right now is working. If something was showing softness or not working, then I wouldn't have the confidence I have right now, but everything is working in terms of the things we're pursuing. Is transient impacts that we're seeing right now? They're obvious. They're systemic. Everybody is seeing them. You can measure them systematically in terms of what's going on in These will pass. The question is when will they pass."

So look, 1 of the data points we look at is the cost of freight. So for instance, people are -- the cost of freight has been going up and up and up as you've been seeing this capacity compaction with regards to moving things. So that's one metric if you just sit there and look at and say, hey, if the cost of freight goes down, that's a sign that flow-through and throughput is starting to soften up. That's one thing that's out there. Another thing is some of the costs of the core commodities that our customers do, I mean, the would. I mean, I know that sounds true, but the cost of wood in some of our it's a big deal. If you -- if your cost of wood or wood-based materials goes up 20%, 30%, 40% on a fixed bid contract, what is that doing to your ability to execute? So you look at cost of freight, you look at cost of wood and the things associated with that and those have direct impact. The cost of any commodity going into manufacturing is going to have have impacts. So the last thing that I think is really interesting with regards to manufacturing is some of these chip shipments starting to losen up and allowing people to kind of finish their machines and make sure that the electronics are actually assembled and together. So these are some of the things that all of us can look at to see how things are going. The cost of freight being right up there, the cost of wood and commodities associated with building things being out in front. We're going to continue to look at the monthly active usage because for us, that's a predictor of people doing more with the products, and that will probably follow some of these other indicators changing. Does that make sense, Sterling?"

Our third quarter results were strong driven by one of our best ever quarters for new subscriptions, record subscription renewal rates, a net revenue retention rate towards the high end of our range and a solid competitive performance. We also grew RPO and billings 18% and 16%, respectively, despite a tougher compare versus last year. Relative to the first and second quarters, the rate of improvement decelerated during the third quarter more than we expected. While demand is robust, we believe supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, making it harder for our customers to staff new projects and the ebb and flow of COVID are contributing to the deceleration as well as documented country-specific disruption to AEC in China. 
Our conversation with customers and channel partners reinforce our view. We're encouraged that embracing digital transformation to drive efficiency and sustainability remains a priority for our customers. Our end-to-end solutions, business model flexibility and platform position us well competitively and enable more customers to enter and remain in our ecosystem. 
As you heard at our recent Investor Day at Autodesk University, we are rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to increase and realize the opportunity ahead. Notable milestones during the quarter included the launch of our Flex consumption model and our plans to combine technologies, connect processes, automate workflows and unlock valuable insights for customers through our Forge Platform. 
The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Climate Change COP26 meeting in Glasgow, both underscore the urgency of reducing carbon in earth's atmosphere and the role that everyone, including corporations needs to play. Sustainability needs to be designed, made and, in many cases, retrofitted in construction and manufacturing. This cannot be achieved efficiently or effectively without end-to-end software like ours to drive the process. This organizing principle affects not just how we deploy capital, for example, through our investments to develop sustainable tools and our recent acquisition of Innovyze, but also how we source capital. Many of our largest equity holders already aligned to our sustainability goals. In the third quarter, we began to align our debt holders by issuing our first sustainability bond linked to our sustainability goals. 
Now let me turn the call over to Debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. I'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives."
119902,1687074169,2447962,"Autodesk, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, our third quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, rapidly expanding digital sales and increasing subscription renewal rates. Total revenue grow",1027,"Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, our third quarter results were strong. Several factors contributed to that, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, rapidly expanding digital sales and increasing subscription renewal rates. Total revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 18% and 17% in constant currency with subscription revenue growing by 21%. 
Looking at revenue by product, the growth we saw was broad-based. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenue grew 14%. AEC revenue grew 22% and manufacturing revenue grew 16%, M&E revenue grew 17%. Across the globe, revenue grew 18% in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 18% in APAC. Direct revenue increased 34% and represented 35% of our total revenue, up from 31% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. 
As you heard at our Investor Day, about 3/4 of new customers Autodesk are now generated through our digital channels, reflecting the strength of our simplified buying experiences. Our product subscription renewal rates reached record highs, and our net revenue retention rate was toward the high end of our 100% to 110% range. Billings increased 16% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand and a tough comparison versus last year when we signed 2 of our largest ever EBAs including a 9-digit deal. Total deferred revenue grew 14% to $3.3 billion. Total RPO of $4.2 billion and current RPO of $2.9 billion grew 18% and 21%, respectively. 
Turning to the P&L. Non-GAAP gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-GAAP operating margin increased by 2 percentage points to approximately 32%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. We delivered healthy free cash flow of $257 million during the quarter against a tough comparison from last year, which benefited from pandemic-related payment term extensions. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from our equity plans. 
During the third quarter, we purchased 980,000 shares for $287 million at an average price of approximately $293 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.66 million shares at an average price of approximately $287 per share for total spend of $476 million. 
Looking forward, as Andrew said, we're rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to realize the opportunities ahead. As we discussed last quarter, the shift of multiyear contracts to annual billings as we move into fiscal '24 will drive more predictable free cash flow and better price realization over time, which will make Autodesk a more valuable company. This quarter, we took steps to optimize our capital structure by issuing our first sustainability bonds, which aligns our capital strategy with our sustainability goals, while also extending our debt maturity profile by almost 2 years and reducing our weighted average cost of debt by 40 basis points. 
As we enter Q4, we intend to take steps to reduce our real estate footprint because the pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work and we've moved to a hybrid workforce. As a result, we anticipate we will reduce the square footage of our facilities portfolio by approximately 20% worldwide and that we will take a GAAP-only charge of up to approximately $180 million. The bulk of which will be recognized over the next several months as we execute our plans. Optimizing our facilities costs will allow us to better deploy capital to further our strategy and drive growth. 
Now let me finish with guidance. Demand was robust in Q3, and we expect it to remain so in Q4. However, as Andrew said, macroeconomic headwinds, such as supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of COVID and AEC in China are impacting the pace of our recovery. 
As an example, the growth in new product subscription volumes decelerated from approximately 30% in the first half to mid-20s percent in Q3, which is more than normal seasonality and a tougher comparison versus last year would suggest. This dynamic drove strong billings growth in Q3 that, nonetheless, fell short of our expectations. In light of this macroeconomic uncertainty, as we enter Q4, we're taking a pragmatic approach and are assuming that the supply chain, labor, COVID and country-specific challenges will persist. As a result, we're reducing the midpoint of our billings and free cash flow guidance by approximately $150 million and $100 million, respectively, for full year fiscal '22. Given the nature of our subscription business model and the greater degree of near-term visibility it provides to us and our expectation of continued strong spend discipline, the midpoint of our full year revenue and margin guidance is broadly unchanged. 
We continue to target $2.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal '23 in constant currency because we believe the current macro headwinds we're seeing are transient. But if the growth deceleration and strengthened dollar continue through next year, we could see potential risk to that target of about $100 million to $200 million based on what we know today. FX volatility is a big factor. Rate moves in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. Since then and in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow. We're obviously watching FX rates closely, but it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. 
Beyond cash flow, if you further take the risk into account, revenue growth could end up at the low end of the CAGR we talked about at Investor Day. And fiscal '23 margin could be impacted by about 1 point. We will, of course, update you on our next earnings call when we expect to have more visibility into any impact from macro or FX movements on our fiscal '23 outlook. We remain optimistic about our growth potential beyond fiscal '23, continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margins in the 38% to 40% range and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. These metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. Andrew, back to you."
119902,1687074169,2447962,"Autodesk, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic par",1339,"Thank you, Debbie. Now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic partner, and that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and through business model evolution. Our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals, from architecture and engineering through construction owners, and from product engineering to product manufacturing, and product and data life cycle management. By helping our customers grow and navigate their digital transformation, we will grow, too. 
For example, Bouygues Construction and Colas are leading construction and infrastructure firms based in France with over 100,000 construction employees operating in 60 countries across the globe. In the third quarter, they significantly increased their commitment to Autodesk products such as Revit, AutoCAD and Civil 3D following an accelerated move to BIM and digital workflows over the last 3 years, which significantly increased monthly average users. 
Similarly, Obayashi Corporation, one of the largest construction firms in Japan, which operates in 16 countries worldwide, is accelerating its global consolidation around BIM and a unified 3D technology platform to enable greater efficiency and sustainability. In the third quarter, it expanded its EBA with us. Over the last 2 years, it has more than doubled the number of Revit users and expanded its usage of Autodesk Construction Cloud to connect workflows from design through construction. 
We are further extending our reach into the construction mid-market with the recent launch of Autodesk Build, introduction of an account-based pricing business model and distribution through our channel partners. For example, this quarter, Jacobsen Construction Company, an ENR 400 general contractor in the United States, was looking for a long-term technology partner and to consolidate around a single project management solution that would increase the efficiency of its field teams, while also seamlessly integrating with its accounting solution. While it had previously used a competitor solution for some projects, Jacobsen ultimately chose Autodesk Construction Cloud because of Autodesk Build's robust field and cost management functionality, and the opportunity to integrate it smoothly with existing technology. With new Autodesk Build features and capability launched every 2 months or so and the recently launched ACC bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. 
We're connecting the dots in infrastructure, too. For example, the Administrator of Railway Infrastructures in Spain, or ADIF selected Autodesk products over competitor offerings to support its digital transformation. Backed by our common data environment, ADIF will leverage the Autodesk Construction Cloud to collaborate on project information, on-site development and model coordination to ensure efficient and accurate construction of their railway network. 
Infrastructure remains an important opportunity for Autodesk across the globe. Our end-to-end solutions, which boosts the efficiency and sustainability of customers like ADIF as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate vertical and horizontal design and construction give us a competitive advantage. Much needed additional investment in infrastructure in the United States and across the globe will restore aging infrastructure and increase the productivity of the economy. Perhaps more consequentially in the long term, provisions in the U.S. infrastructure bill which encourages Department of Transportation to digitize their processes, should accelerate adoption of digital workflows and enable all infrastructure investment to become more efficient and sustainable. 
Turning to manufacturing. We sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter. In automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing and connected factories as automotive OEMs seek to break down work silos at shorten handoff and design cycles. Ford, one of the largest automotive OEMs in the world, renewed and expanded its EBA with Autodesk during the third quarter, growing users in Alias and VRED in design and AutoCAD Inventor and Navisworks in manufacturing, while adding Autodesk Construction Cloud and Autodesk Build in facilities and manufacturing to enable field access to plant drawings during maintenance and operations and equipment changeover. 
Fusion 360 commercial subscribers again grew strongly without any systematic sales promotion, ending the quarter with 175,000 subscribers. While still early days, our new extensions, including machining, generative design and nesting and fabrication are performing well, and there is major interest in our upcoming simulation and design extensions. Fewer promotions and growing demand for Fusion 360's extensions are enabling us to capture more of the potential market opportunity and accelerate our growth. 
Fast Radius is a leading digital manufacturing and supply chain company. The company's proprietary cloud manufacturing platform combines software and advanced micro factories that enable its customers to flexibly design, make and move certified products. Fast Radius already uses several Autodesk products. This quarter, it added Fusion 360 with a machining extension to support its in-house CNC operation and integrate it alongside its existing additive manufacturing offering. Fusion 360 enables Fast Radius to program a wide variety of parts more quickly, resulting in faster product cycle times. 
Outside of commercial use, there is a large and rapidly growing ecosystem of users that are taking Fusion 360 from education and home into the workplace. These will fuel commercial usage in the future. As one measure of this ecosystem, we ended the third quarter with 1 million monthly active users, up over 50% year-over-year, and they are doing some amazing work. 
On September 12, the Technical University of Munich's TUM Boring team beat more than 400 applicants and 12 finalists to win the inaugural, Not-a-Boring Competition. As Haokun Zheng, 1 of the 5 leads responsible for project operations said, ""Fusion 360's cloud-based solution enables our 60-member team to collaborate remotely during the pandemic and design and build an award-winning 40-foot long, 22-ton tunneling machine. Throughout the year, we were repeatedly told by industry experts that the time line we were aiming for was borderline impossible. The Fusion 360's ease-of-use and integrated CAD, CAM and FEM enabled rapid simulation and improve the speed and efficiency of the design workflow."" 
And finally, we continue to enable more users to participate in our ecosystem more productively through business model innovation and our license compliance initiatives. For example, a sustainable building engineering design solutions consultant in Australia, which has been an Autodesk AEC customer for more than a decade, added our premium offering in the third quarter to enable it to better manage its subscriptions and provide more secure single sign-on across multiple offices. Across Autodesk, the number of premium subscribers increased more than 500% year-over-year. 
And in the Middle East, large telecoms company undertaking its own digital transformation was seeking to increase efficiency and sustainability by adopting BIM standards and streamlining digital workflows, while also ensuring license compliance across a fragmented employee base. 
During the process, we become the trusted partner of choice, resulting in a significant investment in AEC Collections, AutoCAD, Revit and 3ds Max. Year-to-date, license compliance billings across Autodesk as a whole are up 20% when compared to the same period 2 years ago and almost 50% year-over-year. 
In speaking with customers, partners and employees, we are very optimistic about the future. They have demonstrated grit and determination, inspiration and innovation, and agility and transformation during the pandemic. And while there will certainly be twist and turns on the road ahead, in many ways, the pandemic has accelerated the future and increased my confidence that we are on the right path. We are executing well in challenging times and believe we have only significant opportunities ahead of us. 
I am reminded again that Autodesk's purpose has never been more important or urgent.

Let me start and then Debbie and I will kind of tag team here on some of this. So first off, Saket, let's make sure we all kind of level set on the business is strong. You saw the numbers. We're seeing tremendous growth. We're seeing record renewal r",354,"Yes. Let me start and then Debbie and I will kind of tag team here on some of this. So first off, Saket, let's make sure we all kind of level set on the business is strong. You saw the numbers. We're seeing tremendous growth. We're seeing record renewal rates. We're approaching net revenue retention rates at the high end of our guide, and they're continuing to go up, right? That's super, super important here, and we feel pretty good about where the business is going. So the business is strong, and we're seeing a lot of strength there. 
If you look at what we're talking about here, we saw several things happened during the quarter, and we got this reinforced by our customers and by our channel partners. We saw a deceleration in what we were seeing around monthly active usage and all things associated with that. And that then translated into to us kind of looking at our guide and looking at things going forward, and we pragmatically just assumed at this point that what we saw in the quarter is going to continue into Q4. And that's what you're seeing, a pragmatic assessment that, hey, this kind of supply chain pressure, this inflationary pressure that's kind of squeezing the margins with some of our customers is going to continue into Q4. 
If we look forward in terms of the guide, in terms of what's going on into next year, look, we assume 2 things. One, this interesting FX environment we're in, which I want Debbie to kind of comment on again and kind of reinforce some of the things she said in the opening commentary, presents some potential risk. So we want to flag those risks. In addition, if some of these supply chain issues bleed over into the beginning of next year, we wanted to flag some additional risk there, but there's certainly a large currency headwind that we're seeing. And I'd like Debbie to just kind of reiterate some of the things she said in the opening commentary so we can all get on the same page about that."

Let me go back to the fiscal '22 guide first because I think one of the metrics that I talked about in the opening commentary pretty much says it all. And that is that for our new volume growth, we saw a 30% growth for the first half of fiscal '22, and then in Q3, it was in the mid-20s. So it was still very strong growth. It just fell short of our expectations. As we look ahead, we did highlight the potential risks that we see to fiscal '23 free cash flow. And it's true that FX, based on what we know today, is a big factor. It's been highly volatile. The rate moves that we saw in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. And since then and, in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow. So as you can imagine, we're obviously watching FX rates closely. But it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. 
Our goal today was just to highlight the risk as we look ahead to next year. But it's important to remind that overall, the strategy is working, and we have numerous growth levers to capitalize on over the long term."

These things play out over multiple years. This is a great bill. We're really happy to see it. Included in the bill is a $100 million fund to accelerate investment in digital tools for Department of Transportation. We feel that that's a good thing and it's an important part of this bill from our perspective because it's going to change the ecosystem. But these things play out over a long term. 
We're certainly really happy about the fact that we have invested in water ahead of these critical investments in infrastructure because water is going to matter a lot. Clean water, water management in terms of flooding or storage of water, wastewater processing, all these things, water is going to be a big deal. So we're going to see our engagement in water projects probably increase over the next couple of years. But I want to make sure that we're all clear that we don't build these into our numbers right now, and we want to -- we're going to wait and see how these things play out over the next couple of years, but we will absolutely see some of our investments in road, rail and water pay off over a multiyear period here.

So let's look kind of like back up to 3 months ago, and set some of the context too, so that we kind of get a sense for this. So 3 months ago, we were heading into the quarter seeing strong renewal rates, proj",414,"Yes. Yes, Adam, it was an excellent question. So let's look kind of like back up to 3 months ago, and set some of the context too, so that we kind of get a sense for this. So 3 months ago, we were heading into the quarter seeing strong renewal rates, projecting strong renewal rates heading in, we saw those strong renewal rates. We're at record renewal rates. We're continuing to see those things. We also saw monthly active usage increasing robustly heading into the quarter. As the quarter progressed, that increase in monthly active usage decelerated a little bit. It continued to grow. It's just the second derivative kind of went negative on us, and it didn't continue to accelerate at the pace we expected to see. 
So what's driving that? For a lot of our customers, the book of business they're seeing is robust. They have more demand than they're actually able to fulfill on right now. And you can see it in all the indices and all the indicators. What you also saw during the quarter, these supply chain backlogs and these inflationary pressures peaked in the quarter and continued persistently throughout the quarter. So while they have this big book of business, or they have existing ongoing projects, if you're on the AEC side and say you're on a fixed bid contract, you're going to see margin pressure because your cost of goods to deliver the projects that you're working on is going up, as is your cost of labor and actually your labor pool is tight and constrained. 
So you're seeing all these factors increase -- pinching your margins, and it's affecting your buying behavior at some times. So even in this environment, where we saw all of these forces, including the labor shortages and things associated with that, we actually continued to grow robustly, just not where we expected to. Now if you're on the manufacturing side, which you noticed we did very well especially relative to our competitors. Even there, they're not able to fulfill on all of the demand they have heading into their businesses. So they're not collecting cash as fast because they're not shipping the products that they're getting ordered from their customers. So all of these things are playing out. It didn't stop people from buying technology, but it certainly slowed down some of the activity relative to our expectations around people buying and investing in their technology portfolio. Does that make sense?"

We saw the mean over the growth in monthly active usage and the associated impact there. So it wasn't lifting the way we expected it to in the second half. In fact, like I said, the second derivative changed and lean over a little bit. So these predictors, these tracking mechanisms we have, I think are still valid. They're powerful. They actually gave us indications of things that were going on. I think we're also, frankly, tracking the inflationary environment a bit more right now, trying to make sure what's happening with the goods and labor pool that our customers are engaging with. 
We're going to be paying attention to that. There's hopeful signs out there, that some of this is loosening up in some respects, but we're going to be watching that. Now with regards with some of the business coming back, it is absolutely possible that that's the case. Our customers are definitely looking at a backlog of projects and a backlog of orders and all the things associated with that. I think it's prudent at this point for us to kind of -- with the information we have right now, assume that we're just going to see kind of an ongoing kind of impact from these things until something changes. But it is possible that some of this could come back as a result of releasing pressure. But it's not. I don't think it's prudent right now to declare that.

The CRPO growth decelerated mainly because of declining contribution from multiyear EBA deals that closed in fiscal '20 which are entering the final year of their term. That growth deceleration was in line with our expectations, and it's something that we signaled on our last earnings call. We anticipate over time that the growth rates for CRPO and revenue will gradually converge over time. But also that, that RPO growth rate is going to continue to be influenced by the timing and volume of EBAs. And so given that Q4 is a big EBA quarter for us, that's going to have a big impact on the growth rate next quarter."

So again, I want to make sure that we're clear on some of these things. The business was very strong. And that second derivative was a slowing down of the acceleration that we were expecting to see coming into the second half of the year. So it's a slowing down, it's not a decline. I just want to be super clear on that so that we can get all positioned on that. Now in terms of where we think this is going to head out, we continue to think that these monthly active usage rates are going to continue to grow and that we're going to continue to see increases associated with these things. We're just prudently assuming that what we saw in Q3 continues into Q4 because based on what we wanted to see was like this uplift in monthly active usage at a higher rate than what we saw, it's probably a safe bet to just assume this is going to coast into Q4. 
If something changes, if these pressures start to relieve and start to relax, we could absolutely see an improving environment. But the business is strong. The renewal rates are strong, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. The net retention revenue rates are strong. The slowdown was rather broad brushed except for the country-specific issues that we highlighted in China. So there was no 1 product area that saw a slowing. But I want you to note something pretty important here. Look at the competitive position that we came out of this year, particularly in manufacturing and other places. We're growing much more robustly than any of our competition in the space. It's just we have high expectations and we wanted to see some of those high expectations fulfilled. So that's how we view this right now, and that's how we're viewing it heading into the rest of the year. Does that answer your question? Or did you want to clarify something?"

If anything, that's continuing to strengthen. So that feels really good. So there's really -- it really was affecting the new book of business, which kind of bleeds into the long tail of our business at some point into some level, which is to be expected in environments like this. Those who are most cash flow constrained, tend to slow their buying down the most. So I don't see any bleed over potential. In fact, in a lot of our newer businesses, we saw robust growth associated with some of these things. So I do not see a crossover or a bleed over between these things. In fact, we continue to expect continued strengthening of net revenue retention rates in the base."

This was addressed at the Investor Day as maybe being a risk area, but also an opportunity perhaps for technology adoption. Even recently, it seems like engineering firms are acknowledging that hiring support, bigger backlogs might be tough, but technology, again, could be an opportunity. So I guess the question is, how do you think about the new seat contribution for your growth algorithm in the context of double digits being sustainable? Would you expect a bigger contribution from the application and content side of the growth model and how to think about seats, given the current macro backdrop?"
119902,1687074169,2447962,"Autodesk, Inc., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 23, 2021",2021-11-23,"Earnings Calls","Autodesk, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So we absolutely think that we continue to see digitization tailwinds here. Customers are absolutely turning to technology to wrestle with some of these problems and solve some of these things. And if you look at the strategy around double-digit grow",544,"Yes. So we absolutely think that we continue to see digitization tailwinds here. Customers are absolutely turning to technology to wrestle with some of these problems and solve some of these things. And if you look at the strategy around double-digit growth and where we're going, you see a lot of things working. First off, let's just pause and -- I don't want to say this too many times, but the business is doing strong and that's setting a floor on some of our growth. Also, I wanted you to notice some of the things that happened with noncompliant revenue. We grew 50% year-over-year, reflecting the compare to kind of the slowdown we did in the COVID year -- in the 2020 and around the pandemic, and we normalized the kind of like a 20-year -- 20% growth over the 2-year period, which shows nice steady growth in some of these things. 
So if you look at the business, you see a lot of things working really well. Now if you look at the long-term trends that are going to contribute and be additive in terms of driving the double-digit growth, the digitization is there, the tailwinds continue, customers are telling us more and more, they want to go deeper, deeper, deeper in digitization. And we're seeing strong adoption -- like for instance in construction with our largest EBA customers and some of our largest GCs, we're seeing strong adoption of Construction Cloud or integrating Construction Cloud more deeply into some of these relationships. If you look at some of the incremental drivers we were talking about with regards to business model capabilities and some of the things associated we're continuing to see strong growth there in terms of new types of subscription models, noncompliant users. And then when we talk about the long tail. While it's really early days with the Flex model, and I want to make sure that we always say it's early days with the Flex model. 
One of the things we're seeing with Flex is exactly what we expected to see. We're seeing a large percent of Flex business coming in is net new. Another chunk of Flex business coming in is these occasional usage buyers. People that classically bought network licenses previously. And another chunk of business where people trying and using more advanced products, products they weren't going to use previously. Those trends are exactly the kind of trends we want to see with offerings like this. And as time goes on and we get more experience with Flex, we expect those trends to continue. So all of the things that we're pursuing to drive double-digit growth are working right now. And that's what gives us confidence as we move forward into the FY '23, '24 and '25 and beyond, is that everything we're doing right now is working. 
If something was showing softness or not working, then I wouldn't have the confidence I have right now, but everything is working in terms of the things we're pursuing. Is transient impacts that we're seeing right now, they're obvious, they're systemic. Everybody is seeing them. You can measure them systematically in terms of what's going on out there. These will pass. The question is when will they pass."

So look, one of the data points we look at is the cost of freight. So for instance, people are just -- the cost of freight has been going up and up and up as you've been seeing this capacity compaction with regards to moving things. So that's one metric you just sit there and look at and say, hey. If the cost of freight goes down, that's a sign that flow-through and throughput is starting to soften up. That's one thing that's out there. Another thing is some of the costs of the core commodities that our customers use, I mean, let's face it, wood. I mean, I know that sounds true, but the cost of wood in some of our AEC, it's a big deal. If you -- if your cost of wood or wood-based materials goes up 20%, 30%, 40% on a fixed bid contract, what is that doing to your ability to execute? 
So you look at cost of freight, you look at cost of wood and the things associated with that and those have direct impact. The cost of any commodity going into manufacturing is going to have impacts. So the last thing that I think is really interesting with regards to manufacturing is some of these chip shipments starting to losen up and allowing people to kind of finish their machines and make sure all the electronics are actually assembled and together. So these are some of the things that all of us can look at to see how things are going. The cost of freight being right up there, the cost of wood and commodities associated with building things being out in front. We're going to continue to look at the monthly active usage because for us, that's a predictor of people doing more with the products, and that will probably follow some of these other indicators changing. Does that make sense, Sterling?"
