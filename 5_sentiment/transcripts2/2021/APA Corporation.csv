Today, I will recap Apache's 2020 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter results, on our outlook for 2021. First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the severe weather and devastating power outages experienced here in Texas last week. Nearly all of our Texas-based employees were directly affected. Our field staff worked tirelessly to maintain safe operations and like millions of Texans, our employees across the state experienced notable challenges, including a lack of power, heat, water and many of the modern conveniences we all rely on. While it appears that numerous factors played into the situation, one thing is certain. This event has underscored the need for resilient and reliable energy infrastructure and supply. 2020 brought many unexpected which required immediate and aggressive actions. Shortly after we issued our initial guidance for the year, a confluence of events signaled clear trouble for near-term oil prices. The Russians and Saudi's in a battle for market share were flooding the market with supply. At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 was emerging as a significant to global demand.
In response, on March 12, we announced several important steps designed to protect cash flow in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price environment. We reduced our capital budget by 37% from the budget we had laid out just 2 weeks earlier. We cut our dividend by 90%. We initiated a shutdown of all drilling and completions activity in the U.S. and a reduction of rig activity in both Egypt and the North Sea. And with the significant reduction in planned capital activity, we decided to double our target for combined G&A and LOE cost savings from $150 million to over $300 million. While these actions seemed extreme to many, they turned out to be necessary and timely.
Throughout 2020, relative to our original plan, we lost over $1.3 billion of oil and gas price-related revenue and more than $300 million of cash flow to working capital. Despite this, Apache finished the year with no increase in net debt when excluding Altus Midstream. We were even in a position to take advantage of volatility in the debt markets to buy back some bonds at a significant discount and later issued $1.25 billion of new bonds to restructure the debt portfolio and protects near term liquidity.
In addition to these actions, our response to the pandemic was equally swift and effective. We protected employees and minimized operational disruptions by quickly implementing a work-from-home program for office staff and changes in field operating protocols. To date, there have been no known cases of a COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another. I am also especially proud of the assistance we provided to the pandemic response in each of the communities where we operate.
Finally, as we look back on 2020, one of the key highlights was our exploration program in Suriname, where we commenced activity under our joint venture with Total. We have now made 4 significant oil discoveries in our first 4 exploration tests and recently began the appraisal drilling program.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. We ended 2020 on a strong note, beating our fourth quarter guidance for adjusted production, upstream capital expenditures and LOE. Oil production in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations, while gas and NGL production was notably strong as we returned all previously curtailed alpine high volumes to production around the end of October.
In the Permian Basin, we resumed completions activity in response to significantly lower service costs and improving oil prices. In Egypt, we continue to leverage our large acreage position and modern seismic program to further enhance our long-term exploration and development inventory. A recent example of this is the Tayim-North Discovery, which encountered 88-feet of high-quality oil pay. We are waiting on pipeline connections to further assess the reservoir extent and potential for additional development locations.
In the North Sea, we made an important oil discovery in the tertiary play with our lost can well, an offset to Aker BP's discovery on the Norwegian side of the border. In combination with 2 previously undeveloped Apache discoveries in the tertiary, last scan is part of a longer-term development opportunity that could contribute meaningful incremental volumes while leveraging existing infrastructure.
Looking ahead to 2021, last night, we announced an upstream capital program of $1.1 billion consisting of approximately $900 million for development activities and $200 million for exploration, predominantly in Suriname. This program is expected to deliver substantial free cash flow under our assumed price deck of $45 WTI oil and $3 Henry Hub natural gas.
In 2020, we directed a higher percentage of our development capital to international projects that generate better returns in a lower price environment. With the improvement in oil prices, we are returning to a very modest level of activity in the U.S. during 2021.
In the Permian, we are currently running one rig and plan to add a second rig at midyear. This measured approach will advance our objective of mitigating Permian oil production declines. We will likely need to add a third rig at some point to fully arrest the decline.
At Alpine High, we have completed 2 lean gas DUCs that are performing very well and we are planning 5 similar completions this spring. While there are no specific Alpine High drilling plans in 2021, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and remain flexible with this asset. Following several years without operating activity in East Texas, we recently added a rig in the Austin Chalk play. This rig will drill a few wells that are necessary to hold our core acreage position and preserve optionality. We believe the Austin Chalk, which is well situated in their existing infrastructure will likely merit future capital consideration.
In Egypt, we plan to continue running 5 rigs this year. Our goal is to stabilize production and ultimately return Egypt to growth, both of which will require the addition of more rigs. We can quickly flex spending in Egypt as conditions warrant, and we will monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to do so.
In the North Sea, the capital program remains relatively unchanged this year with one floating rig and one platform crew. While production from the North Sea is lumpy on a quarterly basis, we believe we can generally sustain output in the 55,000 to 60,000 BOE a day range for the next several years at this level of activity.
Lastly, in Suriname, we began the transfer a block 58 operatorship to Total at the beginning of the year. They are an excellent operator, and we look forward to this year's exploration and appraisal programs.
On the exploration side, our fourth well, Keskesi, is continuing to explore deeper objectives in the neocomian. As previously announced, we have selected the location for our fifth exploration well, Bon Bonny, which will be in the northern portion of the block. Total spud the first appraisal well in Block 58 earlier this month, which will be appraising aspects of both the Kwaskwasi and Sapakara discoveries.
I would like to close by discussing Apache's oil production trajectory and provide some perspective on maintenance capital levels. As previously noted, we chose to significantly reduce capital spending in 2020 and plan to maintain a conservative investment approach in 2021. One of the outcomes of this choice is that our global adjusted oil volumes decreased by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. This year, we are projecting a much more moderate decline of around 1% to fourth quarter 2021. This implies the $900 million of capital investment we have earmarked for production and development activities is just a bit shy of the spend required to sustain global oil production at fourth quarter 2020 levels.
As we look to 2022 and beyond, our goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that will, at a minimum, sustain production volumes for the long term. While we have experienced a very welcome oil and gas rebound over the last 3 months, our strategic approach remains centered around capital discipline and flexibility. As such, we are continuing to prioritize the retention of free cash flow to reduce debt, a focus on long-term returns over short term growth, aggressive cost structure management, the advancement of our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and continuous improvement in our ESG practices and metrics.
In 2020, we increased the weighting of ESG goals in our short-term compensation calculation to 20% and refined our focus areas to air, water, communities and people. During the year, we emphasized robust employee safety programs related to COVID-19, assisting our communities impacted by the pandemic and advancing programs that foster a more inclusive workplace. We also made good progress on the environmental front with enhanced greenhouse gas data collection and expanded disclosures, particularly with regard to TCFD. We plan to continue to build on these efforts in 2021 with ESG goals that tie directly to compensation and includes specific emissions and water usage targets and enhance our employees' experience. These include delivering less than 1% flaring intensity in the U.S., achieving freshwater consumption less than 20% of total water consumed and further progressing our diversity and inclusion programs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our [ 2 ] results and 2021 outlook."

I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth quarter results debt management efforts in 2020 and our outlook for 2021.As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache r",696,"Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth quarter results debt management efforts in 2020 and our outlook for 2021.
As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Apache reported a fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net income of $10 million. On a fully diluted basis, we incurred a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $20 million or $0.05 per share. 
Company-wide adjusted production for the quarter was 365,000 BOEs per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. This was driven by declines in the Permian Basin and Egypt, where we felt the impacts of reduced activity levels after the first quarter cut in capital spending. These declines were partially offset by increased North Sea production, primarily associated with the timing of workover activity.
Lease operating expenses of $269 million for the quarter were below guidance, but did rise a bit from the third quarter. G&A expense of $76 million was at the low end of our guidance range. This was also an increase from the third quarter, but mostly due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of certain stock compensation programs.
Entering 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year was to retain free cash flow to reduce debt. While the collapse in oil prices made this significantly more challenging, the decisive actions we took to reduce our capital program, cut operating and overhead costs, decrease our dividend and numerous smaller actions, enabled Apache to avoid further leveraging its balance sheet. We also took some important steps to rearrange the bond maturity profile and to create a cleaner runway for the next few years.
For a combination of discounted open market repurchases, tender offers and call options, we reduced shorter-term bond maturities by $600 million, with only minor changes to our average maturity profile and coupon rate. We now have only $336 million of bonds maturing before November of 2025. We still intend to reduce debt levels through free cash flow engine. And if oil and gas prices sustain anywhere near current levels, we will make substantial progress in 2021.
Further to the 2021 outlook, as John stated, we are planning an upstream capital budget of approximately $1.1 billion, with the primary goals of advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and stabilizing global oil production around fourth quarter 2020 levels. At this point, it looks like our planned capital program will fall just a bit short of stabilizing oil production. But we continue to look for ways to get more out of those investments. More specifically, to our production profile for 2021, we expect U.S. oil output to decline in the first quarter. This is primarily attributable to 9 days of extensive Permian Basin shut-ins during the recent freeze event as well as the timing of Permian DUC completions during the quarter. Consequently, we expect a significant rebound in U.S. oil volumes during the second and third quarters before backing off a bit in the fourth quarter to a rate similar to fourth quarter of 2020.
Internationally, we anticipate continued declines for the year compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels as upstream capital investment remains below maintenance levels, and we will incur more downtime in the North Sea for scheduled maintenance turnarounds.
In 2021, we are projecting LOE to rise approximately 7% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the impact of some cost deferrals from 2020. This includes items such as increased workover spending and platform maintenance in the North Sea. We also expect to see some higher foreign currency exchange impacts associated with the weakening U.S. dollar.
G&A will also rise a bit this year to a run rate of around $75 million per quarter. 
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic for a year of improved oil and gas prices. Even if we fall a bit from the current strip, with a very conservative approach to capital budgeting, we should generate significant free cash flow for debt reduction.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The first thing I'll say is I really don't want to add a lot of color to our partners' commentary a long time line. I mean, we're aligned with them. What I would say is that given that when we made the press release after the Sapakara discovery, we said that it merited consideration for fast track and had those key ingredients. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the very first appraisal well is doing exactly that. We've always talked about the first 4 wells, and I'll go back and talk about Maka, Sapakara, Kwaskwasi, and now Keskesi is really 4 different kind of deepwater turbidite channel systems. They are placed where potentially you could do some overlap, and so forth as you start to think about development. So the nice thing about where that first well is play, Sapakara West #2 is it will be appraising both aspects of Sapakara, and we get to see some of Kwaskwasi. So it shouldn't come as a surprise, and we're obviously anxious to get the results.
When we think about the appraisal program, it's just the next step following expiration. And in terms of scale, those are the things we want to determine through the appraisal program. So I don't want to get into discussions on that at this point, but we're going to be looking to determine things like flow rates, connectivity, those types of things, boundaries, things you might see as you work through this. So we're anxious to get on with it. And quite frankly, excited with how quickly Total's grabbed the hold and is running with it."

Not only did we reduce all the drilling rigs in the U.S., we dramatically cut the workover rigs in the U.S. and then the other areas as well. And it just goes to show you with the focus and the effort we're putting on it. This year, we did pick up a rig in the Permian. It's one that made a lot of sense to pick up. We plan to add another rig midyear, and we're going to be just short, as I said in the commentary. We probably need to add another one, but we don't plan to do that right now to be able to kind of hold our oil production. We're just short of the activity levels in Egypt to kind of hold it. And North Sea, is going to be lumpy, and we're kind of in that range. Now where we think we can manage it between 55 and 60. It's just going to be a lumpy profile with the turnarounds and the types of projects we're bringing on through subsea tiebacks in the barrel area. But I really kind of hats off to the operational staff and the asset teams because we're really managing things on cash flow and managing the cost structure really hard, and it's amazing what that's done as a result to the oil curves."

And quite frankly, our first 3 play types are all upper cretaceous, Campanian, Santonian are the first 2 and then the third one actually is Turonian, which is also upper cretaceous. We attempted to get down to the Turonian with Maka, but we were unable to do to pressure. With the Neocomian, it is actually a lower cretaceous target. When I talk about the upper cretaceous Campanian and Santonian, they're really deepwater channel and levy turbinates. But the Neocomian is lower cretaceous, and it's more shallow water harbon reef buildups. And so there's -- I will tell you that we're not through the first 2 targets. We've got 2 Neocomian targets to test in Keskesi, is what we had to do was swap out the BOPs. And so we're in the process of doing that, and we'll be back to drilling. But these are carbonate reefs. They're pretty visible on the seismic but this will be the first test for us, and this is the -- was an optimal place to go on down through the Source rock to the Neocomian, and we're anxious to see, but it is exploration. They're visible. There's -- if it were to work and bear the right fluids, then it sets up a whole string of these that are down there. So it's a play concept test.

So we have an advantaged position. We never got into that super size growth mode in the Permian. So our -- the first year declines that we that we sued in weren't as big as others. So when we look at the capital required for sustaining production, it's kind of in that 3-rig mode or 3-rig level. And you'll see the kind of similar analysis if we look at Egypt as well. It's a bit more conventional declines, but you'll see as overall production declines moderate, it becomes easier to hold production at those levels.

Today, I will recap Apache's 2020 accomplishments, discuss our fourth quarter results and provide commentary on our outlook for 2021. First, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the severe weather and devastating power outages experienced here in Texas last week. Nearly all of our Texas-based employees were directly affected. Our field staff worked tirelessly to maintain safe operations and like millions of Texans, our employees across the state experienced notable challenges, including a lack of power, heat, water and many of the modern conveniences we all rely on. While it appears that numerous factors played into the situation, one thing is certain: this event has underscored the need for resilient and reliable energy infrastructure and supply.
2020 brought many unexpected challenges, which required immediate and aggressive actions. Shortly after we issued our initial guidance for the year, a confluence of events signaled clear trouble for near-term oil prices. The Russians and Saudis, in a battle for market share, were flooding the market with supply. At the same time, the spread of COVID-19 was emerging as a significant threat to global demand.
In response, on March 12, we announced several important steps designed to protect cash flow in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price environment. We reduced our capital budget by 37% from the budget we had laid out just 2 weeks earlier. We cut our dividend by 90%. We initiated a shutdown of all drilling and completions activity in the U.S. and a reduction of rig activity in both Egypt and the North Sea. And with the significant reduction in planned capital activity, we decided to double our target for combined G&A and LOE cost savings from $150 million to over $300 million. While these actions seemed extreme to many, they turned out to be necessary and timely.
Throughout 2020, relative to our original plan, we lost over $1.3 billion of oil and gas price-related revenue and more than $300 million of cash flow to working capital. Despite this, Apache finished the year with no increase in net debt when excluding Altus Midstream. We were even in a position to take advantage of volatility in the debt markets to buy back some bonds at a significant discount and later issued $1.25 billion of new bonds to restructure the debt portfolio and protect near-term liquidity.
In addition to these actions, our response to the pandemic was equally swift and effective. We protected employees and minimized operational disruptions by quickly implementing a work-from-home program for office staff and changes in field operating protocols. To date, there have been no known cases of a COVID-19 transmission from one Apache employee or contractor to another. I am also especially proud of the assistance we provided to the pandemic response in each of the communities where we operate.
Finally, as we look back on 2020, one of the key highlights was our exploration program in Suriname, where we commenced activity under our joint venture with Total. We have now made 4 significant oil discoveries in our first 4 exploration tests and recently began the appraisal drilling program.
Turning to the fourth quarter results. We ended 2020 on a strong note, beating our fourth quarter guidance for adjusted production, upstream capital expenditures and LOE. Oil production in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations, while gas and NGL production was notably strong as we returned all previously curtailed Alpine High volumes to production around the end of October.
In the Permian Basin, we resumed completions activity in response to significantly lower service costs and improving oil prices. In Egypt, we continue to leverage our large acreage position and modern seismic program to further enhance our long-term exploration and development inventory. A recent example of this is the Tayim-North discovery, which encountered 88 feet of high-quality oil play. We are waiting on pipeline connections to further assess the reservoir extent and potential for additional development locations.
In the North Sea, we made an important oil discovery in the tertiary play with our Losgann well, an offset to Aker BP's Froskelår discovery on the Norwegian side of the border. In combination with 2 previously undeveloped Apache discoveries in the tertiary, Losgann is part of a longer-term development opportunity that could contribute meaningful incremental volumes while leveraging existing infrastructure.
Looking ahead to 2021, last night, we announced an upstream capital program of $1.1 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million for development activities and $200 million for exploration, predominantly in Suriname. This program is expected to deliver substantial free cash flow under our assumed price deck of $45 WTI oil and $3 Henry Hub natural gas.
In 2020, we directed a higher percentage of our development capital to international projects that generate better returns in a lower price environment. With the improvement in oil prices, we are returning to a very modest level of activity in the U.S. during 2021.
In the Permian, we are currently running 1 rig and plan to add a second rig at midyear. This measured approach will advance our objective of mitigating Permian oil production declines. We will likely need to add a third rig at some point to fully arrest the decline.
At Alpine High, we have completed 2 lean gas DUCs that are performing very well, and we are planning 5 similar completions this spring. While there are no specific Alpine High drilling plans in 2021, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and remain flexible with this asset.
Following several years without operating activity in East Texas, we recently added a rig in the Austin Chalk play. This rig will drill a few wells that are necessary to hold our core acreage position and preserve optionality. We believe the Austin Chalk, which is well situated in their existing infrastructure, will likely merit future capital consideration.
In Egypt, we plan to continue running 5 rigs this year. Our goal is to stabilize production and ultimately return Egypt to growth, both of which will require the addition of more rigs. We can quickly flex spending in Egypt as conditions warrant, and we will monitor oil prices and cash flow for the appropriate time to do so.
In the North Sea, the capital program remains relatively unchanged this year, with 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. While production from the North Sea is lumpy on a quarterly basis, we believe we can generally sustain output in the 55,000 to 60,000 BOE a day range for the next several years at this level of activity.
Lastly, in Suriname, we began the transfer of Block 58 operatorship to Total at the beginning of the year. They are an excellent operator, and we look forward to this year's exploration and appraisal programs.
On the exploration side, our fourth well, Keskesi, is continuing to explore deeper objectives in the Neocomian. As previously announced, we have selected the location for our fifth exploration well, Bonboni, which will be in the northern portion of the block. Total spud the first appraisal well in Block 58 earlier this month, which will be appraising aspects of both the Kwaskwasi and Sapakara discoveries.
I would like to close by discussing Apache's oil production trajectory and provide some perspective on maintenance capital levels. As previously noted, we chose to significantly reduce capital spending in 2020 and plan to maintain a conservative investment approach in 2021. One of the outcomes of this choice is that our global adjusted oil volumes decreased by 17% from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2020. This year, we are projecting a much more moderate decline of around 1% to fourth quarter 2021. This implies the $900 million of capital investment we have earmarked for production and development activities is just a bit shy of the spend required to sustain global oil production at fourth quarter 2020 levels.
As we look to 2022 and beyond, our goal is to establish a development capital investment budget that will, at a minimum, sustain production volumes for the long term. While we have experienced a very welcome oil and gas rebound over the last 3 months, our strategic approach remains centered around capital discipline and flexibility. As such, we are continuing to prioritize the retention of free cash flow to reduce debt, a focus on long-term returns over short term growth, aggressive cost structure management, the advancement of our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and continuous improvement in our ESG practices and metrics.
In 2020, we increased the weighting of ESG goals in our short-term compensation calculation to 20% and refined our focus areas to air, water, communities and people. During the year, we emphasized robust employee safety programs related to COVID-19, assisting our communities impacted by the pandemic and advancing programs that foster a more inclusive workplace. We also made good progress on the environmental front with enhanced greenhouse gas data collection and expanded disclosures, particularly with regard to TCFD. We plan to continue to build on these efforts in 2021 with ESG goals that tie directly to compensation and includes specific emissions and water usage targets and enhance our employees' experience. These include delivering less than 1% flaring intensity in the U.S., achieving freshwater consumption less than 20% of total water consumed and further progressing our diversity and inclusion programs.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our key results and 2021 outlook."
169838,701923451,2223962,"Apache Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth quarter results, debt management efforts in 2020 and our outlook for 2021.As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache",696,"Thank you, John. I'd like to provide a bit more color around Apache's fourth quarter results, debt management efforts in 2020 and our outlook for 2021.
As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, Apache reported a fourth quarter 2020 consolidated net income of $10 million. On a fully diluted basis, we incurred a loss of $16 million or $0.04 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $20 million or $0.05 per share.
Company-wide adjusted production for the quarter was 365,000 BOEs per day, a 7% decrease from the third quarter. This was driven by declines in the Permian Basin and Egypt, where we felt the impacts of reduced activity levels after the first quarter cut in capital spending. These declines were partially offset by increased North Sea production primarily associated with the timing of workover activity.
Lease operating expenses of $269 million for the quarter were below guidance, but did rise a bit from the third quarter. G&A expense of $76 million was at the low end of our guidance range. This was also an increase from the third quarter, but mostly due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of certain stock compensation programs.
Entering 2020, one of our key financial goals for the year was to retain free cash flow to reduce debt. While the collapse in oil prices made this significantly more challenging, the decisive actions we took to reduce our capital program, cut operating and overhead costs, decrease our dividend and numerous smaller actions, enabled Apache to avoid further leveraging its balance sheet. We also took some important steps to rearrange the bond maturity profile and to create a cleaner runway for the next few years.
Through a combination of discounted open market repurchases, tender offers and call options, we reduced shorter-term bond maturities by $600 million, with only minor changes to our average maturity profile and coupon rate. We now have only $336 million of bonds maturing before November of 2025. We still intend to reduce debt levels through free cash flow retention. And if oil and gas prices sustain anywhere near current levels, we will make substantial progress in 2021.
Further to the 2021 outlook, as John stated, we are planning an upstream capital budget of approximately $1.1 billion, with the primary goals of advancing our exploration and appraisal activities in Suriname and stabilizing global oil production around fourth quarter 2020 levels. At this point, it looks like our planned capital program will fall just a bit short of stabilizing oil production. But we continue to look for ways to get more out of those investments.
More specifically, to our production profile for 2021, we expect U.S. oil output to decline in the first quarter. This is primarily attributable to 9 days of extensive Permian Basin shut-ins during the recent freeze event as well as the timing of Permian DUC completions during the quarter. Consequently, we expect a significant rebound in U.S. oil volumes during the second and third quarters before backing off a bit in the fourth quarter to a rate similar to fourth quarter of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate continued declines for the year compared to fourth quarter 2020 levels as upstream capital investment remains below maintenance levels, and we will incur more downtime in the North Sea for scheduled maintenance turnarounds.
In 2021, we are projecting LOE to rise approximately 7% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the impact of some cost deferrals from 2020. This includes items such as increased workover spending and platform maintenance in the North Sea. We also expect to see some higher foreign currency exchange impacts associated with the weakening U.S. dollar. G&A will also rise a bit this year to a run rate of around $75 million per quarter.
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic for a year of improved oil and gas prices. Even if we fall a bit from the current strip, with a very conservative approach to capital budgeting, we should generate significant free cash flow for debt reduction.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

Yes, the first thing I'll say is I really don't want to add a lot of color to our partners' commentary a long time line. I mean we're aligned with them. And what I would say is that given that when we made the press release after the Sapakara discovery, we said that it merited consideration for fast track. It had those key ingredients. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the very first appraisal well is doing exactly that. We've always talked about the first 4 wells, and I'll go back and talk about Maka, Sapakara, Kwaskwasi, and now Keskesi -- is really 4 different kind of deepwater turbidite channel systems. They are placed where potentially you could do some overlap and so forth as you start to think about development. So the nice thing about where that first well is placed, Sapakara West #2, is it will be appraising both aspects of Sapakara, and we get to see some of Kwaskwasi. So it shouldn't come as a surprise, and we're obviously anxious to get the results.
When we think about the appraisal program, it's just the next step following exploration. And in terms of scale, those are the things we want to determine through the appraisal program. So I don't want to get into discussions on that at this point, but we're going to be looking to determine things like flow rates, connectivity, those types of things, boundaries, things you might see as you work through this. So we're anxious to get on with it. And quite frankly, excited with how quickly Total's grabbed the hold and is running with it."

I mean in a really tough environment, with COVID-19 and a lot more protocols added, I cannot say enough good things about our organization and all the hard work that's taking place. And you see that. You saw it in our cost structure reductions. You see it in these numbers. Not only did we reduce all the drilling rigs in the U.S., we dramatically cut the workover rigs in the U.S. and then the other areas as well. And it just goes to show you what the focus and the effort we're putting on it.
This year, we did pick up a rig in the Permian. It's one that made a lot of sense to pick up. We plan to add another rig midyear, and we're going to be just short as I said in the commentary. We probably need to add another one, but we don't plan to do that right now to be able to kind of hold our oil production. We're just short of the activity levels in Egypt to kind of hold it. And North Sea is going to be lumpy, and we're kind of in that range now where we think we can manage it between 55,000 and 60,000. It's just going to be a lumpy profile with the turnarounds and the types of projects we're bringing on through subsea tiebacks in the barrel area. But I really -- kind of hats off to the operational staff and the asset teams because we're really managing things on cash flow and managing the cost structure really hard, and it's amazing what that's done as a result to the oil curves."

With the Neocomian, it is actually a lower cretaceous target. When I talk about the upper cretaceous, Campanian and Santonian, they're really deepwater channel and levy turbidites. But the Neocomian is -- it's lower cretaceous, and it's more shallow water carbonate reef buildups.
And so there's -- I will tell you that we're not through the first 2 targets. We've got 2 Neocomian targets to test in Keskesi, is -- what we had to do was swap out the BOPs. And so we're in the process of doing that, and we'll be back to drilling. But these are carbonate reefs. They're pretty visible on the seismic.

So it's just a lens into the rock that you would have seen otherwise, and that's what we're excited about."

I don't have those at the tip of my fingers, but you know how unconventionals work.

So think about 1/3 or more of our Permian production is a very shallow decline that the Central Basin platform type well. So we have an advantaged position. We never got into that super size growth mode in the Permian. So our -- the first year declines that we anniversary-ed in weren't as big as others. So when we look at the capital required for sustaining production, it's kind of in that 3-rig mode or 3-rig level.
And you'll see the kind of similar analysis if we look at Egypt as well. It's a bit more conventional declines, but you'll see, as overall production declines moderate, it becomes easier to hold production at those levels.
So I don't have numbers in front of me, but that's directionally where the -- why the maintenance capital is probably lower today than what we've talked about in the past."

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Spec",1057,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. 
Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. 
Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. 
Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up 1 additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including 2 at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. 
On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than 1 year. The agreement is comprehensive and when ratified by parliament will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. 
Currently, we are running a 5-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. 
Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. 
In the North Sea, we have been operating 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. 
In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. 
In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running 2 rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. 
Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracy Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracy's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. 
And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. broadly defined these fall into 3 areas of emphasis: air, water and communities and people. 
In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. 
In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook."
169838,711474359,2272853,"APA Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items",960,"Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. 
We had a very good first quarter. with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. 
So let me take you through most of the significant items. Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimized those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. 
Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas, is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. 
So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in 3 ways: first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing You will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. 
Second, our underlying contracts also determined the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, purchased oil and gas sales and purchased oil and gas costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. 
In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. 
Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. 
Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction initially through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. 
Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course. We anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. 
In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now have to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through, the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified. And then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been -- become noncompetitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that."

And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the maintain the business and so let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year",256,"Yes. Thanks. Let's step back. And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the maintain the business and so let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers of development capital and that's -- and in that mode, productions in a modest decline. So we think about 2 places we'd want to flex capital to rest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line addition to the 2, we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about 7 to 8 rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that put you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, what we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to to add some more color on that?"

So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. And we've talked about this in the past that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet [Audio Gap] Egypt, especially Egypt with the modernization efforts [Audio Gap] or does that proceeds and gets the final approval. And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the the capital investment in that. And I'll just echo once again, John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of grocers because this is not is not an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending."

And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration. It seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year."

And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in 1 quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We -- the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is. So we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Surinam aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname. You only need about 0 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this what I would call, well over $1 billion of free cash flow in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that We certainly are confident we can do that for 5 to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that."

And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's ultimately the real underlying goal is to get back to investment grade, and we're going to do whatever it takes to do that. We're clearly making some tremendous progress this year by our estimation at the current strip We'll have net debt-to-EBITDA down to approaching to about 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA at the end of this year. Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2% or 2.3%.

And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that. It does benefit shareholders directly with debt pay down. And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We -- as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade.

And this is not -- it's not uncommon. You got to understand these PSCs, we've been in Egypt for over 2.5 decades now. A lot of these fields have been operated since the mid-90s. And so stepping back and going through this, this is just the evolution that's required in an oilfield, right? So."

And with regard to the LOE, it was just a masterful performance by our operations folks in the field. They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well field-by-field basis. There's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation in service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels."

It is something that we were paying attention to in the North Sea. But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint, are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we are performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin. But also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general, getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time."

So modernization in Egypt is going to have a big impact for us. It is going to enable us to put Egypt back on a track where we can grow those volumes, and I think it's going to be very beneficial. I think in Permian, we've got 1 rig running today. We're planning to pick up a second rig midyear. As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital efficient use of that capital. Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with is Total as operator. They've got 2 rigs running in the vicinity of of the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects."

Clay Bretches, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Dave Pursell, Executive Vice President, Development, will also be available on the call to answer questions. Our prepared remarks will be approximately 15 minutes in length with the remainder of the hour allotted for Q&A. 
In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. 
Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. This quarter, we have also introduced the term free cash flow, which is defined on Page 20 in the glossary of our supplement. 
Consistent with previous reporting practices, adjusted production numbers cited in today's call are adjusted to exclude noncontrolling interest in Egypt and Egypt tax barrels. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussions will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is located with the supplemental information on our website.

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Spec",1057,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. 
Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. 
Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. 
Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up 1 additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including 2 at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. 
On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than 1 year. The agreement is comprehensive, and when ratified by parliament, will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. 
Currently, we are running a 5-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. 
Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. In the North Sea, we have been operating 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. 
In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. 
In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running 2 rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. 
Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. 
First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. 
Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. 
Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. 
Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. 
Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracey Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracey's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. 
And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. Broadly defined these fall into 3 areas of emphasis: air, water, and communities and people. In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. 
In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook."
169838,711474359,2273261,"APA Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items",960,"Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. 
We had a very good first quarter with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. So let me take you through most of the significant items. 
Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin, and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimize those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. 
As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. 
So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in 3 ways: first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing You will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. 
Second, our underlying contracts also determine the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, Purchased Oil and Gas Sales and Purchased Oil and Gas Costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. 
In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. 
Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. 
I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. 
Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction, initially, through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. 
Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course, we anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. 
Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. 
In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And obviously, that's consistent with what you've said in the past, John, about eventually wanting to get the U.S. and Egypt, and 2022 and beyond is sort of more of a maintenance level activity at the least. And so I know in the past, the sort of the commentary around Egypt had been from the 5 rigs you're currently running, probably wanting to get to at least a couple of rigs more to at least get to that maintenance level. So until told otherwise by you all, is that  a fair assumption to assume that, that's kind of where you want to get to in Egypt for the -- by year-end?"

But I think what you've seen is, finally, we can get out in the public about a real important step in the process that we've been working through and modernizing our PSCs in Egypt. This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC, we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now had to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified, and then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been -- become noncompetitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that."

And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around",256,"Yes. Thanks. Let's step back. And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. 
So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers -- $900 million of development capital. And that's -- and in that mode, production's in a modest decline. 
So we think about 2 places we'd want to flex capital to arrest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily, and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line in addition to the 2 we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about 7 to 8 rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that puts you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. 
And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, but we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to  add some more color on that."

So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900",328,"Yes. So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname, was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain, and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. 
And we've talked about this in the past, that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that  we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet [Audio Gap] Egypt, especially Egypt with the modernization efforts [Audio Gap] or does that proceeds and gets the final approval. And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the the capital investment in that. 
And I'll just echo once again John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of [ growthers ] because this is not  an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending."

And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration, it seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into it. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year."

My second one, I won't go to Suriname this time, but I'd like to ask you, Steve, about free cash flow. 
Look, obviously, $500 million adjusting for working capital, $1 billion for the year that current. There is some something not adding up there. I just wonder if you could just frame for us what you think the scale of the more than $1 billion could look like. 
And more importantly, in a relatively complex portfolio in some people's view, what's the longevity, ex Suriname, of sustaining that free cash flow from the current portfolio? And I'll leave it at that."

And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks.

And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in 1 quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the -- of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. 
And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We -- the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is, so we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. 
And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Suriname aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname, you only need about 100 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this, what I would call well over $1 billion of free cash flow, in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that we certainly are confident we can do that for 5 to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that."

Yes, we've talked about the fact that we are -- we've talked externally about -- we're targeting at least getting down to 1.5x debt to EBITDA. We may need to move lower than that. Certainly, the direction things have been moving in general over time. We believe something at or below that number is going to be what's required to get back to investment grade. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's ultimately the real underlying goal, is to get back to investment grade, and we're going to do whatever it takes to do that. We're clearly making some tremendous progress this year by our estimation at the current strip. We'll have net debt-to-EBITDA down to approaching 2, about 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA at the end of this year. Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2 or 2.3. So it doesn't move up considerably. So we're -- we've made tremendous progress or will make tremendous progress this year if prices hold up. 
As far as how we're going to do that, we haven't gotten into the details of exactly how we're going to do that. But it obviously has to result in paying off some of the bonds historically. What we've generally said is we're going to do it the same way we've done it in the past. We've done combinations of open market repurchases. We've done 10b5-1s. We've done tender offers, refinances, and we will do all of the above. I don't believe -- at this point in time, I don't believe you'll see a material amount of refinances going forward until we get to -- back to investment grade. We've got about a little over $335 million of debt maturing in the next couple of years, and that will just be paid down as it matures."

I -- obviously, both of those are important. I think we have to get the balance sheet in order and get debt down and get at least at a minimum, get back closer to a point where we think achieve investment grade before we start looking at the dividend again. And as we've discussed before and I think we've talked with you specifically about it, we look at debt paydown as a return to shareholders because every dollar of debt that we can get off the balance sheet today will add more than $1 to the  market cap of the company, we believe, because we think that the debt level is actually weighing on the share price. And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that, it does benefit shareholders directly with debt paydown. 
And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We -- as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade. That is clearly an option for us."

They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand. Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in 2020. So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that, but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. 
If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian. A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. 
Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well, field-by-field basis, there's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. 
So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation and service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels."

But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. 
And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we were performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin, but also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general. Getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. 
So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time."

As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively, that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital -- efficient use of that capital. 
Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with -- as Total as operator. They've got 2 rigs running in the vicinity of  the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right, and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects."

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Spec",1057,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. 
Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. 
Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. 
Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up 1 additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including 2 at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. 
On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than 1 year. The agreement is comprehensive, and when ratified by parliament, will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. 
Currently, we are running a 5-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. 
Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. In the North Sea, we have been operating 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. 
In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. 
In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running 2 rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. 
Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. 
First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. 
Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. 
Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. 
Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. 
Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracey Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracey's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. 
And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. Broadly defined these fall into 3 areas of emphasis: air, water, and communities and people. In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. 
In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook."
169838,711474359,2273262,"APA Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items",960,"Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. 
We had a very good first quarter with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. So let me take you through most of the significant items. 
Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin, and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimize those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. 
As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. 
So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in 3 ways: first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing You will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. 
Second, our underlying contracts also determine the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, Purchased Oil and Gas Sales and Purchased Oil and Gas Costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. 
In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. 
Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. 
I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. 
Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction, initially, through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. 
Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course, we anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. 
Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. 
In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And obviously, that's consistent with what you've said in the past, John, about eventually wanting to get the U.S. and Egypt, and 2022 and beyond is sort of more of a maintenance level activity at the least. And so I know in the past, the sort of the commentary around Egypt had been from the 5 rigs you're currently running, probably wanting to get to at least a couple of rigs more to at least get to that maintenance level. So until told otherwise by you all, is that  a fair assumption to assume that, that's kind of where you want to get to in Egypt for the -- by year-end?"

But I think what you've seen is, finally, we can get out in the public about a real important step in the process that we've been working through and modernizing our PSCs in Egypt. This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC, we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now had to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified, and then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been -- become noncompetitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that."

And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. 
So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers -- $900 million of development capital. And that's -- and in that mode, production's in a modest decline. 
So we think about 2 places we'd want to flex capital to arrest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily, and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line in addition to the 2 we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about 7 to 8 rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that puts you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. 
And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, but we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to  add some more color on that."

So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname, was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain, and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. 
And we've talked about this in the past, that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that  we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet [Audio Gap] Egypt, especially Egypt with the modernization efforts [Audio Gap] or does that proceeds and gets the final approval. And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the the capital investment in that. 
And I'll just echo once again John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of [ growthers ] because this is not  an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending."

And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration, it seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into it. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year."

And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in 1 quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the -- of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. 
And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We -- the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is, so we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. 
And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Suriname aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname, you only need about 100 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this, what I would call well over $1 billion of free cash flow, in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that we certainly are confident we can do that for 5 to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that."

Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2 or 2.3.

I -- obviously, both of those are important. I think we have to get the balance sheet in order and get debt down and get at least at a minimum, get back closer to a point where we think achieve investment grade before we start looking at the dividend again. And as we've discussed before and I think we've talked with you specifically about it, we look at debt paydown as a return to shareholders because every dollar of debt that we can get off the balance sheet today will add more than $1 to the  market cap of the company, we believe, because we think that the debt level is actually weighing on the share price. And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that, it does benefit shareholders directly with debt paydown. 
And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We -- as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade. That is clearly an option for us."

They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand. Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in 2020. So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that, but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. 
If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian. A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. 
Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well, field-by-field basis, there's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. 
So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation and service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels."

So key goals there. 
We're looking at things in the North Sea. But as far as right now, the near-term things, we're looking at some of the low-hanging fruit that we can  get after. I don't know if, Clay, you want to add anything on the carbon side in the North Sea."

So we will take a look at that anywhere that we see a price on carbon. It is something that we were paying attention to in the North Sea. But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. 
And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we were performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin, but also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general. Getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. 
So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time."

So modernization in Egypt is going to have a big impact for us. It is going to enable us to put Egypt back on a track where we can grow those volumes, and I think it's going to be very beneficial. 
I think in Permian, we've got 1 rig running today. We're planning to pick up a second rig midyear. As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively, that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital -- efficient use of that capital. 
Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with -- as Total as operator. They've got 2 rigs running in the vicinity of  the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right, and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects."

But given where oil prices are, and we've got -- as we've talked about on this call, we have a constrained capital budget with oil in the 60s, it's hard for Alpine to compete with oilier capital in the Permian and in Egypt. So our view is let's evaluate the performance of the DUCs and then we'll decide or evaluate potential third-party capital."

In conjunction with yesterday's press release, I hope you have had the opportunity to review our first quarter financial and operational supplement, which can be found on our Investor Relations website at investor.apacorp.com. 
Please note that we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. This quarter, we have also introduced the term free cash flow, which is defined on Page 20 in the glossary of our supplement.

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Spec",1057,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's first quarter results and discuss our 2021 priorities. Despite some significant weather-related challenges, we delivered a strong first quarter. Specifically, our free cash flow generation was over $500 million. We performed well relative to our production and cost expectations, and our safety performance was excellent. 
Our total adjusted production exceeded guidance as Permian oil and gas volumes benefited from a faster-than-expected recovery from the February storm impacts. This more than offset lower international adjusted volumes resulting from the impact of higher oil prices on our Egypt PSC cost recovery barrels and some extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment and LOE were considerably below guidance for the quarter. Together with strong price realizations, these factors contributed to an exceptional quarter of free cash flow generation, all of which is being designated for debt reduction. 
Looking ahead, the full year guidance we provided in February is unchanged, and we are clearly off to a good start. 
Turning now to operations in the United States. We reactivated a rig in the Permian Basin, which was previously on standby and picked up 1 additional rig to drill a 4-well program in the Austin Chalk play of Texas in Brazos and Washington counties. We placed 22 wells online in the Permian, including 2 at Alpine High. Roughly 5,000 BOEs per day of lower-margin Permian production remains shut in at the end of the first quarter. We are very pleased with the early results and combined with the recovery from Winter Storm Uri are expecting a significant increase in second and third quarter production. 
On Tuesday, we announced an agreement in principle with the Ministry of Petroleum and the Egyptian General Petroleum Company to modernize the terms of our current production sharing contracts, which is the result of a process that has been underway for more than 1 year. The agreement is comprehensive, and when ratified by parliament, will result in increased activity, capital investment and oil-focused production growth over the next several years. 
Currently, we are running a 5-rig program in Egypt and continue to build quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. In the first quarter, we had another significant oil discovery at our Hadid prospect, the details of which are in our financial and operational supplement. We are projecting Egypt gross production will bottom in the second quarter and trend up in the second half of the year. 
Debottlenecking of certain pipelines of facilities and the addition of compression capacity will enable us to connect roughly 35 wells in the second half of the year compared to only 20 wells during the first half. These and other 2021 guidance items do not include any potential changes associated with the pending PSC modernization, which we look forward to updating after the agreement is formally approved. In the North Sea, we have been operating 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew for just over a year. At this pace, we are capable of delivering annual production in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 BOE per day for the next several years. 
In 2021, we anticipate North Sea volumes will be a bit lower as we experienced unplanned compressor downtime in the 40s field during the first quarter and will incur extended pipeline downtime and platform maintenance turnarounds during the second and third quarters. Following this, however, we expect a sharp rebound in production during the fourth quarter 2021. 
In January, we announced a discovery at our fourth exploration well in Suriname. An appraisal plan for this well, Keskesi is forthcoming. Total has now fully assumed operatorship of Block 58 and is running 2 rigs in the vicinity of the Sapakara discovery. Both rigs are capable of appraisal and exploration drilling, which provides ultimate flexibility as we execute our programs. We look forward to providing updates as appropriate in the future. 
Next, I would like to review our priorities for 2021, which we outlined previously on our February conference call. 
First, we are budgeting conservatively and focusing on free cash flow generation and debt reduction. This year, our reinvestment rate is currently tracking below 50%. 
Second, we are aggressively managing our cost structure, and we'll continue to do so regardless of the oil price environment. 
Third, we are preserving optionality within our portfolio, which will enable us to either develop or possibly monetize certain assets at the appropriate time. 
Fourth, we are advancing the exploration and appraisal programs in Suriname and are now beginning to benefit from our joint venture carry agreement, which is a very efficient funding source for our differential long-term opportunity in Block 58. 
Fifth, we are continuing to focus on value creation through organic exploration. We recently announced the hiring of Tracey Henderson to lead our exploration team, which concludes an extensive search that began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracey's experience and expertise are a great fit for the existing APA portfolio and we look forward to her leadership on future exploration strategy and ventures. 
And lastly, we are advancing ESG initiatives that are relevant, impactful and core to our business. Broadly defined these fall into 3 areas of emphasis: air, water, and communities and people. In 2021, we have established goals that address routine flaring, freshwater consumption and diversity and inclusion programs. These goals are linked to the annual incentive compensation of not just management, but all employees. We made excellent progress in each of these areas during the first quarter and I look forward to discussing them further as we progress these efforts through the year. 
In closing, I would like to thank all of our employees across the globe for their hard work in the first quarter And in particular, our field personnel and contractors on the front lines that did an excellent job of safely navigating global pandemic protocols as well as some very extreme weather events. During the historic freeze in Texas, our teams worked around the clock to maintain and restore the hydrocarbon production systems that are vitally important to ensuring the safety and well-being of people and communities during events such as this. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the first quarter and our 2021 outlook."
169838,711474359,2324721,"APA Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items",960,"Thanks, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported first quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $388 million or $1.02 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings, the most significant of which is a $43 million valuation allowance adjustment for deferred taxes in the quarter. Excluding this and other smaller items, the adjusted net income was $346 million or $0.91 per share. 
We had a very good first quarter with most financial results being in line or better than our previous guidance. Notable exceptions were North Sea production, which John addressed; and G&A expense, which was $83 million. While underlying spend was in line with our guidance of around $75 million, additional charges were recognized for the mark-to-market impact on certain stock compensation programs. First quarter results were significantly influenced by U.S. natural gas pricing volatility associated with Winter Storm Uri. The impacts of the storm appear in several places on the income statement. So let me take you through most of the significant items. 
Since it determines the reporting of results, I'll first remind everyone of how we handle Permian Basin gas production. We sell all of our gas production in basin, and then manage our long-haul transport obligations separately. We optimize those obligations through the purchase, transport and sale of gas from various receipt points in the Permian Basin and in the Gulf Coast areas. Our common practice as we contract for the purchase and sale of gas is to maintain a relatively balanced exposure between gas daily and first-of-month pricing. 
As the end of January approach, we had a portfolio of purchase and sales contracts that were heavily skewed to February first-of-month pricing. As we commonly do when this is the case, we use financial contracts to rebalance that exposure closer to 50-50. 
So given the unusually high gas price spike that occurred in mid-February, this impacted first quarter reporting of results in 3 ways: first, our underlying sales contracts for produced gas determine the reporting of revenue and realizations. Since approximately half of our underlying sales contracts for February production were at gas daily pricing You will see a significant increase in both natural gas revenues on the income statement and in the average realized price for U.S. gas for the quarter. 
Second, our underlying contracts also determine the reporting of revenues and costs associated with our activities to purchase, transport and sell gas to fulfill our transportation obligations. The results of these activities appear in the lines entitled, Purchased Oil and Gas Sales and Purchased Oil and Gas Costs on our P&L. Combined, we incurred a loss of $54 million on that activity in the first quarter, which includes the cost of the transport and the fuel associated with that transport. 
In a normal quarter, given current differentials, we would expect this loss to be in the $25 million to $35 million range. For the first quarter, this loss was compounded by a volume imbalance in our underlying purchase and sale contracts, which resulted in more gas purchased at the higher February daily prices and more sales at the lower first-of-month pricing. 
Finally, since we used the financial swap to rebalance our underlying contract portfolio, a good portion of the price spike benefit appears in the $158 million derivative instrument gain on the income statement. If our underlying contract portfolio had been more balanced in the first place, we would not have used the derivative contract, and we would not have this gain. Instead, we would have reported higher gas revenues and a lower loss on sales of purchased gas. 
I know I went through that quickly, and it can be confusing. If you have further questions, please call Gary's team and they can take you through it in further detail. 
Free cash flow was also strong in the first quarter, exceeding $500 million. That cash is being used for debt reduction, initially, through the pay down of our revolver. Excluding the consolidated effects of Altus Midstream, we reduced net debt by $339 million in the quarter, mostly through the retention of cash. If the current price environment holds up, we anticipate at least $1 billion of net debt reduction in 2021. 
Turning now to some additional comments around our 2021 outlook. Our full year 2021 production, capital, LOE and G&A guidance all remain unchanged. Assuming the recently announced PSC modernization in Egypt proceeds on course, we anticipate adding some capital activity in Egypt for the second half of 2021. We will update our guidance for Egypt as we proceed through that approval process. We have also expanded our guidance to include the anticipated effects of purchasing and selling gas in the U.S. to fulfill our transport obligations, which I discussed previously. 
Lastly, for the remainder of the year, we expect our U.S. natural gas realizations will closely approximate Waha and El Paso Permian pricing. You will find all of our current guidance items in the financial and operational supplement. 
In closing, we look forward to a very strong year of free cash flow generation of at least $1 billion. This should take us a good bit of the way toward our previously mentioned leverage target of around 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA under a mid-cycle pricing scenario. You should understand, however, that our more relevant objective is to return to investment-grade credit status. To that end, we will continue to budget conservatively, focus on costs, free cash flow generation and debt reduction and maintain close contact with the rating agencies to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to achieve that goal in a timely manner. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And obviously, that's consistent with what you've said in the past, John, about eventually wanting to get the U.S. and Egypt, and 2022 and beyond is sort of more of a maintenance level activity at the least. And so I know in the past, the sort of the commentary around Egypt had been from the 5 rigs you're currently running, probably wanting to get to at least a couple of rigs more to at least get to that maintenance level. So until told otherwise by you all, is that  a fair assumption to assume that, that's kind of where you want to get to in Egypt for the -- by year-end?"

But I think what you've seen is, finally, we can get out in the public about a real important step in the process that we've been working through and modernizing our PSCs in Egypt. This is something that we started really prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will tell you, we've been negotiating in good faith and in earnest with Egypt since -- for more than a year. And we're at a point today where after working with the Minister of Petroleum as well as EGPC, we were able to announce this on Tuesday. It's really a framework that sets the future for Egypt. We've been clear not to touch guidance this year. We've now had to go through the approval process, and there are some steps to go through the parliamentary process and ultimately get things ratified, and then we'll be able to talk more about it. But as we go through the year, we will be picking up some activity. There's just a lot of projects in Egypt that had been -- become noncompetitive because of the terms of the PSC, and this is really going to open up some projects that we're ready to fund. I think this is going to be a win-win for both the country of Egypt and Apache, and it's going to really put us on a much stronger than just maintenance curve for Egypt. So Dave, I'll let you jump in and add a little bit more to that."

And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around",256,"Yes. Thanks. Let's step back. And I think, John, you had -- you framed your question on what we've said before around wanting to maintain the business. So let's think about maintenance capital. 
So right now, we're going to spend this year roughly around -- these are going to be round numbers -- $900 million of development capital. And that's -- and in that mode, production's in a modest decline. 
So we think about 2 places we'd want to flex capital to arrest that decline, that would be in the U.S. in the Permian Basin, primarily, and in Egypt. If you think about a rig line, we've talked about needing potentially a full rig line or a partial rig line in addition to the 2 we'll have in the second half of this year in the Permian to sustain production and then more rigs in Egypt. And we've talked about 7 to 8 rigs needed to sustain or maintain production there. And so if you think about a rig line in the Permian and a handful of rigs in Egypt, that puts you roughly $200 million incremental dollars. So our maintenance capital is about $1.1 billion. 
And the key here is we're not talking about material growth, but we're talking about maintaining production. And that gives us some optionality in the portfolio to where we want to add that capital to maintain our global production. And so that frames the maintenance capital, and I'll throw it over to Steve to  add some more color on that."
169838,711474359,2324721,"APA Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Yes. So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900",427,"Yes. So we entered, I think, good context for this is that we entered the year as people will recall, it seems like years ago, but ended this year with a plan that was based on $45 WTI, and it had a -- as Dave called it, the development capital, the $900 million of development capital, if we just set aside Suriname, was about a 60% reinvestment rate. And at current strip, that same amount of capital is less than a 40% reinvestment rate. So clearly, this is not a reinvestment rate that's going to sustain, and it's not a maintenance level of capital spending. And so we've got a continued slight decline in production volumes. 
And we've talked about this in the past, that the #1 priority coming into the year when it still looked like a pretty difficult year was that we needed to get debt paid down. We needed to get the balance sheet strengthened, and we needed to start that process. And that was the most important financial priority. But it is prudent to spend at a maintenance capital level and to maintain the production volume going forward. And we probably need somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million more development capital in order to get into that neighborhood. With prices where they are and if they hold up, I think we're likely to start increasing capital in the second half in order to get to that point. And most of that, as Dave outlined, is going to be in the Permian and Egypt. And especially Egypt with the modernization effort as that proceeds and gets the final approval. 
And I just want to echo on that. The issue there was the old structure of the PSCs and how they work. These were very old vintage PSC structures. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Egypt actually has some very highly economic opportunities in quite a bit of them and just needed the PSC structure that enabled the the capital investment in that. 
And I'll just echo once again John's point that none of this is in our guidance. It's not in the capital for guidance nor is it in the production volume or anything else for guidance. And just to reinforce what Dave said, I'd ask that we please don't throw us into the bucket of [ growthers ] because this is not  an aggressive growth spending plan. This is just about a prudent step towards getting to at least a maintenance level of capital spending."

And I guess we'll just wait to see when we ultimately get up to Bonboni. But at the very least, it seems like just given that you are on the hook for 12.5% on appraisal versus 50% on exploration, it seems like that created a little bit of slack in the budget, unless I'm reading too much into it. There's at least a little slack because just by definition, it seems like your Suriname on budget from where you started the year is probably a touch lower just given the -- a little bit more of a skew toward appraisal versus exploration at least through the first half of the year."

But I'll just say, we -- stepping back, it's a holistic approach. This is something that will be good for Egypt. We've looked at things very carefully. This has been a process that has been very lengthy and very thorough and very comprehensive. And it really is in line with the minister's objective of modernizing the oilfield in Egypt. And I think it's going to have some benefits that's going to enable us to direct more dollars into the drilling programs and into the volumes, which are going to generate more revenue. 
And so we've got a deep inventory. We're seeing good early results off of the seismic with the Hadid announcement that we had this -- within the supplement this go-around. So we're excited about Egypt. And quite frankly, this really puts us in a position where we can fund some projects that are ready to go."

And more importantly, in a relatively complex portfolio in some people's view, what's the longevity, ex Suriname, of sustaining that free cash flow from the current portfolio? And I'll leave it at that."

And I think that I was probably a bit too understated in my prepared remarks. And the point of that was really just to highlight where we've gotten to in 1 quarter from the plan that we laid out to all of you in February. Our original plan, as I said, we report at $45 WTI. It had somewhere around $350 million of free cash flow. And the point of the -- of my prepared remarks was to just indicate that it's over $1 billion now. 
And maybe I could do a little bit better than that and say that at the current strip, it will be well over $1 billion. We -- the only thing I would say about that, though, is we don't give guidance on free cash flow. We haven't done that in the past. And I don't want to start that process on an iterative basis at this point, mainly because there are so many different measures out there of what people call free cash flow. And we've defined what ours is, so we're very clear about that. But we're going to continue not to give guidance on it. 
And the second thing I would say is, if I go back to my comments earlier around maintenance capital, on the -- if you just set Suriname aside, we're somewhere -- and yet, we continue to invest $200 million in Suriname, you only need about 100 -- somewhere between $100 million and $200 million more to get to a maintenance level of capital on the development side. So we're not far from that. And then -- and so that's what your difference is, it requires $100 million to $200 million more in order to sustainably access this, what I would call well over $1 billion of free cash flow, in this price environment for an extended period of time. And I think what we've shared in the past is that we certainly are confident we can do that for 5 to 10 years, and we're always looking for opportunities to be able to do that for an extended period of time beyond that."

Yes, we've talked about the fact that we are -- we've talked externally about -- we're targeting at least getting down to 1.5x debt to EBITDA. We may need to move lower than that. Certainly, the direction things have been moving in general over time. We believe something at or below that number is going to be what's required to get back to investment grade. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that's ultimately the real underlying goal, is to get back to investment grade, and we're going to do whatever it takes to do that. We're clearly making some tremendous progress this year by our estimation at the current strip. We'll have net debt-to-EBITDA down to approaching 2, about 2.1x debt-to-EBITDA at the end of this year. Even if you adjusted that to -- well, what would happen if we were in a $55 price environment for 2022, we'd still only be slightly higher than the 2.1, maybe 2.2 or 2.3. So it doesn't move up considerably. So we're -- we've made tremendous progress or will make tremendous progress this year if prices hold up. 
As far as how we're going to do that, we haven't gotten into the details of exactly how we're going to do that. But it obviously has to result in paying off some of the bonds historically. What we've generally said is we're going to do it the same way we've done it in the past. We've done combinations of open market repurchases. We've done 10b5-1s. We've done tender offers, refinances, and we will do all of the above. I don't believe -- at this point in time, I don't believe you'll see a material amount of refinances going forward until we get to -- back to investment grade. We've got about a little over $335 million of debt maturing in the next couple of years, and that will just be paid down as it matures."

I -- obviously, both of those are important. I think we have to get the balance sheet in order and get debt down and get at least at a minimum, get back closer to a point where we think achieve investment grade before we start looking at the dividend again. And as we've discussed before and I think we've talked with you specifically about it, we look at debt paydown as a return to shareholders because every dollar of debt that we can get off the balance sheet today will add more than $1 to the  market cap of the company, we believe, because we think that the debt level is actually weighing on the share price. And so while it's not the same as a dividend and we recognize that, it does benefit shareholders directly with debt paydown. 
And we haven't made any specific plans as to what we're going to do. We've got quite a bit still to accomplish on the debt paydown effort. We -- as I said, we'll accomplish quite a bit of that, hopefully, this year. We'll need to do more of it in 2022. And at an appropriate time, we'll reconsider whether we need to bring the dividend back or whether we want to start bringing the dividend back and we'll certainly hold out the option that we could start looking at the dividend prior to actually getting investment grade.

They did a great job. They understood the task that was at hand. Last year, we went through some significant cost-cutting exercises. We identified the areas where we could cut cost. We knew that those needed to be sustainable, especially when we were looking at commodity prices in 2020. So we had an all-hands-on-deck approach to this. There was a lot of bottoms-up initiatives that led to this LOE reduction. It wasn't short term. It wasn't just deferral of expenditures, maintenance, et cetera. There was some of that, but it wasn't significant. The big issues here in LOE reduction had to do with those initiatives that took place. 
If you take a look at where we had the most significant reductions, it was in the Permian. A lot of that had to do with the wells that we shut-in. We have a lot of wells that are what we call frequent flyers, wells that go down a lot. We took those out of service, and those are still shut-in because they cost us a lot of money and they're not economic to run. 
Furthermore, a lot of our waterflood properties that just weren't providing the economics, we went through and looked at these on a well-by-well, field-by-field basis, there's a lot of water that's not being injected right now because it's really expensive to inject that water. We still have approximately 300,000 barrels a day of water that we don't inject, which saves us a lot on electricity, a lot on maintenance, a lot on personnel overall. 
So in general, it's just the approach that we took. We want to maintain that. That's something that we talk about as an operations group on a regular basis. How do we maintain this low LOE profile as we go forward? In light of the fact that commodity prices are increasing, we do have concern about inflation and service costs. So we focus on making sure that we keep that LOE down, continue to strive to find initiatives that are going to keep the LOE down and flat in light of the fact that we know that there's going to be some inflationary pressures going forward. So really, again, just kudos to our operations team for getting us to where we are and maintaining those levels."

But like John said, what we're focused on right now from an ESG standpoint are those areas that we have control and which are going to be impactful for Apache. So the really big initiative for us from an ESG standpoint is to end our routine flaring in the U.S. onshore by the end of 2021. 
And we think this is really significant. You hear a lot of ESG claims out there that talk about some type of initiative that's aimed at 2030, 2040, 2050. What we're doing is saying we're going to end routine flaring by the end of this year. And we think that's really significant. And it represents a significant commitment by Apache to do the right thing and to produce responsibly. And we've shown that over and over. If you take a look at the investment that we have made in midstream solutions to make sure that we were performing responsibly, not only with Altus Midstream with those gathering and processing assets that we have in the Delaware Basin, but also our significant investment in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, Permian Highway pipeline. Both of those are moving over 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Permian Basin that not only serves Apache, but it serves a basin in general. Getting that gas out of there and creating opportunities for others to get gas that otherwise would be flared out of the basin. 
So we've put a lot of investment in those pipes. We've put a lot of commitment in terms of firm transportation to anchor those pipes. So we feel like we're really doing a lot that impacts the gas flaring and ESG initiatives in real time."

The second question is certainly, Total have indicated they will sanction the first development this year coming on stream in 2025.

So modernization in Egypt is going to have a big impact for us. It is going to enable us to put Egypt back on a track where we can grow those volumes, and I think it's going to be very beneficial. 
I think in Permian, we've got 1 rig running today. We're planning to pick up a second rig midyear. As David has said, we need to grab another rig there to kind of maintain our Permian volumes, and that would be an objective of ours But I think as we look going forward beyond that, we don't see trying to ramp up to a big activity pace and try to grow aggressively, that we think we want a modified moderate investment pace where we're investing very wisely and very -- making very capital -- efficient use of that capital. 
Your question on Suriname, clearly, we're underway with -- as Total as operator. They've got 2 rigs running in the vicinity of  the Sapakara discovery. We have not put out any time lines, and I don't see a anything magical about when you need the FID a project. I think the key for us is doing the appraisal work collecting the data, so we can ultimately FID a project. There's lots of optionality. You are very likely looking at potential FPSOs like what's been done next door, but it's just really premature to get into anything there. I don't see anything magical about a year-end time line to make a first oil 2025. I think that could easily slide into next year and still make that type of time frame. So we're not pressing for any hurdle there. You want to do the work, you want to do it right, and then you want to be in a position to FID the projects when you're ready to FID the projects."

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021.The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We gene",1072,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We generated nearly $400 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. And at June 30, held approximately $1.2 billion of cash, which will be used primarily for debt reduction.
In May, we reached an agreement in principle with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts. The final draft of which has now been completed and will move to Egyptian Parliament for ratification in the fall and then to the President for his approval. We are pleased with the progress thus far and believe that this modernization will return Egypt to the most attractive area for capital investment within our portfolio, and we'll put Egyptian oil production back on a growth trajectory.
In Suriname, as announced in our press release last week, we drilled a successful appraisal well in the Sapakara area, moving us closer to our goal of sanctioning the first commercial oil development. We are generating strong results from our DUC completion program in the Permian. And during the second quarter, we closed 2 smaller scale Central Basin platform asset sales as we continue to optimize our portfolio.
On the ESG front, APA continues to deliver on our key initiatives and safety metrics. Most notably, at the beginning of the year, we established an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the U.S. in 2021, and I am pleased to announce that we will achieve this goal in the third quarter. This is the result of adding compression where appropriate, setting clear expectations and rules in the field and improving hydrocarbon processing at location. These efforts have also helped to drive down our flaring intensity, which is tracking well below our goal of less than 1% for the year. We are also making great progress on our water initiatives. In the U.S., we are currently at 3% freshwater usage, which is also well below our goal of less than 20% for the year.
Turning now to operations. Total adjusted production exceeded our guidance in the second quarter, with the U.S. benefiting from better-than-expected performance throughout our Permian Basin DUC completion program. This more than offset lower international volumes where higher oil prices impacted Egypt cost recovery volumes and we experienced extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment was below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to timing, while LOE was slightly above expectations. Our full year outlook for these items remains unchanged.
In the U.S., we placed a total of 27 wells online in the Permian, including 5 at Alpine High. In aggregate, these wells are significantly exceeding internal expectations driven by a combination of optimization initiatives. This effectively completes our backlog of Permian DUCs, so you will see fewer well connections during the second half of the year. You'll also see Permian production come down a bit in the second half of the year as our current pace of drilling and completions is not sufficient to offset the initial declines from the DUC completion program.
As previously planned, we added a second Permian Basin rig in late June, which will enable a steadier pace of completions. In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 3 operated wells and are pleased with the results thus far. We are evaluating the addition of a third drilling rig in the U.S., as previously noted, which would put us on a path to sustained oil production. Given strong oil prices and the recent improvement in natural gas and NGL prices, all of our U.S. asset areas are attractive candidates for this rig addition.
In Egypt, we have increased our rig count to 8 and continue to build high-quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. Facilities expansion constrained our ability to connect wells in the first half of the year and contributed to a decline in gross production during the second quarter. As we wrap up our facilities work, well connections will increase significantly in the second half of the year and gross production will begin trending up.
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew. During the second quarter, production was impacted by compressor downtime, extended platform turnaround work and third-party pipeline outages. Some of this carried over into July. And when combined with planned maintenance turnarounds at barrel, will lead to only a modest production increase in the third quarter. Once we conclude this heavy maintenance period, production volumes in the North Sea should return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter.
In Suriname's Block 58, we are running 2 rigs. Upon completion of drilling operations at Sapakara, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the Bonboni exploration prospect, approximately 45 kilometers to the north. Following Bonboni, the Valiant will return to flow test the Sapakara South-1 well. Drilling activities continue at the Keskesi South-1 appraisal well with the Maersk developer.
On Block 53, where APA is the operator and 45% working interest owner, we recently signed a contract with Noble Corporation to secure a drillship that will commence exploration operations in the first quarter of 2022.
Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Oil prices year-to-date have averaged well above our original budgeted level of $45 WTI. And more recently, gas and NGL prices have also begun to significantly exceed budgeted levels. This has created a very welcome amount of incremental free cash flow and will enable substantial progress on debt reduction this year. More importantly, our 2021 capital program will remain unchanged at $1.1 billion, even if we decide to add a third rig in the U.S. later this year.
In June, we opened our Houston and Midland offices and began welcoming back the majority of our office staff as permitted by regional guidelines. It has been great to see more in-person collaboration in settings that we took for granted prior to COVID-19, and we will remain diligent with our protocols to keep employees safe.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the second quarter and our 2021 outlook."

These results include i",674,"Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings.
Excluding the second quarter impacts of divestiture gains, movements in our tax valuation allowance, mark-to-market derivative losses and other smaller items, adjusted net income was $266 million or $0.70 per share. Most of our financial results were in line or better than guidance this quarter, with just a few minor exceptions.
As we've discussed in the past, we continuously review our portfolio for the right time to monetize assets that no longer compete for funding. In the second quarter, we closed the sales of 2 such packages in the Central Basin platform. These were mostly lower margin conventional waterflood assets, which we're producing roughly 2,500 barrels of oil per day. Proceeds from the sales were $178 million.
As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we are updating some of our full year guidance items. We are effectively increasing U.S. production guidance by 4,500 BOEs per day and decreasing international adjusted production guidance by 14,500 BOEs per day compared to the midpoint of the previous respective ranges. This net decrease of 10,000 BOEs per day for the full year reflects the strong underlying performance of our U.S. assets, but it also captures the impact of a few offsets, the unplanned operational downtime in the North Sea, the impact of higher oil prices on Egypt cost recovery barrels and the recent Permian Basin asset sales. We are reducing full year DD&A guidance by $125 million, which reflects a combination of price-related reserve additions and the impact of our changing production mix with lower North Sea volumes and higher U.S. volumes.
Finally, other than an increase to our expected U.K. tax expense due to strong commodity prices, there are no material changes to the remainder of our guidance for the year. On a longer-term perspective, one of our most important strategic goals is to return to investment-grade status, which will require a significant reduction in debt. In the near term, progress towards this goal takes priority over the capital program, which, today, is still below a sustaining level of development capital. In other words, we are willing to under-invest slightly in the short term to build balance sheet strength and financial resilience for the longer term.
We entered 2021 anticipating a multiyear process of debt reduction. With this price environment, we're making significant progress more quickly than we thought possible. In the first half of the year, at an average WTI price of $62, we delivered upstream-only free cash flow, which excludes dividends received from Altus Midstream of $860 million. Assuming current strip prices for the second half of 2021, upstream-only free cash flow for the full year is expected to be around $1.7 billion. The vast majority of this cash will be available for debt reduction.
The rating agencies will ultimately decide when we return to investment grade, but we will clearly make significant progress in 2021.  With meaningful progress on debt in sight, we would remind everyone that we have a strong portfolio of investable inventory, and it would be prudent to at least increase development capital to a production sustaining level. We estimate this would require around $1.2 billion of annual investment versus the $900 million we are investing in development capital this year. At this investment pace, and assuming prices remain flat with 2021, as we look out to the next several years, APA is capable of generating upstream-only free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion annually. This is all based on our current portfolio of assets. And to highlight what the current portfolio can deliver, this analysis assumes no further investment or future benefit from Suriname and no free cash flow uplift associated with Egypt modernization, which is still pending.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

169838,1674490186,2364825,"APA Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Yes, Doug, and let me actually put some parameters around the whole $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks.And John said it gets confusing because of the same numbers. But John talked about 2021 being $",699,"Yes, Doug, and let me actually put some parameters around the whole $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks.
And John said it gets confusing because of the same numbers. But John talked about 2021 being $1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that's based on first half actual prices plus the second half strip, and that is our internal most current outlook for the business for the full year.
In 2022, we say $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that is sustainable for a run of years, and we can talk about that a bit. I'd put 2 caveats on that. Number one, we're not attempting in any way to give guidance for '22 and beyond at this point in time. That's a hypothetical case. But I want people to understand that, that's a very realistic case. We know our inventory today better than we've ever known it, and we put together a realistic case based on what we would actually invest in, in the current price environment.
As I said in my remarks, it is focused on the current portfolio. So we've kind of chosen to eliminate the noise associated with Suriname. It doesn't have any future Suriname CapEx. No future Suriname production or free cash flow. And just to be clear, we don't want that to be -- to come across as any reflection on our feelings about Suriname because that doesn't reflect that at all.
The prices that we used in that case are exactly the same as the 2021 prices because I didn't want those to affect the comparability of the results. The CapEx, as we know, 2021 is $1.1 billion. In our hypothetical case for '22 and beyond, it's $1.2 billion. There's a difference though. The $1.1 billion includes $200 million of exploration spend, which is mostly focused on Suriname exploration and appraisal. So there's only $900 million of development capital in there.
The $1.2 billion for '22 is all development capital. And we've talked about a number slightly lower than that $1.1 billion is sustaining capital development -- capital spending. That was when we were talking about sustaining oil production volume. The case that we've put together now sustains -- the $1.2 billion sustains BOEs on a per day basis. So it actually is full production sustaining for a run of years that's adding capital to -- mostly to Egypt and to the U.S.
Under this case, there's a slight decline in volume from '21 to '22 on an annualized basis, but then it's sustained from 2022 forward. So some people might be wondering, okay, you're spending $100 million more of CapEx and you have a lower volume, but free cash flow is roughly the same from '21 to '22. How do you do that? 
First, there's debt paydown assumed in that. So there's less interest expense because we are going to pay down somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion of debt, a little more than that, including what was on the revolver at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing that people may not fully appreciate is that the forward look, our production mix is changing. The spending will create a decline in gas volume and growth in oil volumes. So again, prior case, we talked about was a lower capital because it was just sustaining oil volume. This one is sustaining total volume, but growing oil relative to gas.
And again, a reminder, that doesn't include anything in there for Egypt PSC modernization, which is going to be meaningful. The specific question that you had about the -- how long this is sustainable? If we want to get into the inventory, I'd let David Pursell take that. I'll give him a chance to make a comment here quickly. But this is -- when I say for a run of years, I'll stick with the comment I made last time you asked me this question, Doug, and that is this is at least for 5 to 10 years that we can see out into the future. 
Dave, do you have anything to add?"

So like Egypt post PSC would be growing the North Sea, I previously talked about 1 rig 1 platform can kind of maintain volumes with that 55,000 to 60,000 range. Obviously, first half of this year due to the extended maintenance, you're a good bit below that. So just by default, the North Sea is going to be up a decent bit in '22 versus '21. And then the Permian, it sounds likely -- the base case sounds like it would be to add the third rig in the Permian at year-end '21, which gets that back to sort of a flattish sort of a sustained sort of profile.

In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We gen",1072,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In my prepared remarks, I will review APA Corporation's second quarter results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. 
The company is making good progress on several key initiatives. We generated nearly $400 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. And at June 30, held approximately $1.2 billion of cash, which will be used primarily for debt reduction. 
In May, we reached an agreement in principle with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to modernize the terms of our production sharing contracts. The final draft of which has now been completed and will move to Egyptian Parliament for ratification in the fall and then to the President for his approval. We are pleased with the progress thus far and believe that this modernization will return Egypt to the most attractive area for capital investment within our portfolio, and we'll put Egyptian oil production back on a growth trajectory. 
In Suriname, as announced in our press release last week, we drilled a successful appraisal well in the Sapakara area, moving us closer to our goal of sanctioning the first commercial oil development. We are generating strong results from our DUC completion program in the Permian. And during the second quarter, we closed 2 smaller scale Central Basin platform asset sales as we continue to optimize our portfolio. 
On the ESG front, APA continues to deliver on our key initiatives and safety metrics. Most notably, at the beginning of the year, we established an ambitious goal of eliminating routine flaring in the U.S. in 2021, and I am pleased to announce that we will achieve this goal in the third quarter. 
This is the result of adding compression where appropriate, setting clear expectations and rules in the field and improving hydrocarbon processing at location. These efforts have also helped to drive down our flaring intensity, which is tracking well below our goal of less than 1% for the year. We are also making great progress on our water initiatives. In the U.S., we are currently at 3% freshwater usage, which is also well below our goal of less than 20% for the year. 
Turning now to operations. Total adjusted production exceeded our guidance in the second quarter, with the U.S. benefiting from better-than-expected performance throughout our Permian Basin DUC completion program. This more than offset lower international volumes where higher oil prices impacted Egypt cost recovery volumes and we experienced extended operational downtime in the North Sea. Upstream capital investment was below our guidance for the quarter, primarily due to timing, while LOE was slightly above expectations. Our full year outlook for these items remains unchanged. 
In the U.S., we placed a total of 27 wells online in the Permian, including 5 at Alpine High. In aggregate, these wells are significantly exceeding internal expectations driven by a combination of optimization initiatives. This effectively completes our backlog of Permian DUCs, so you will see fewer well connections during the second half of the year. You'll also see Permian production come down a bit in the second half of the year as our current pace of drilling and completions is not sufficient to offset the initial declines from the DUC completion program. 
As previously planned, we added a second Permian Basin rig in late June, which will enable a steadier pace of completions. In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 3 operated wells and are pleased with the results thus far. We are evaluating the addition of a third drilling rig in the U.S., as previously noted, which would put us on a path to sustained oil production. Given strong oil prices and the recent improvement in natural gas and NGL prices, all of our U.S. asset areas are attractive candidates for this rig addition. 
In Egypt, we have increased our rig count to 8 and continue to build high-quality inventory across our expanded acreage footprint. Facilities expansion constrained our ability to connect wells in the first half of the year and contributed to a decline in gross production during the second quarter. As we wrap up our facilities work, well connections will increase significantly in the second half of the year and gross production will begin trending up. 
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform rig crew. During the second quarter, production was impacted by compressor downtime, extended platform turnaround work and third-party pipeline outages. Some of this carried over into July. And when combined with planned maintenance turnarounds at barrel, will lead to only a modest production increase in the third quarter. Once we conclude this heavy maintenance period, production volumes in the North Sea should return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter. 
In Suriname's Block 58, we are running 2 rigs. Upon completion of drilling operations at Sapakara, the Maersk Valiant will mobilize to the Bonboni exploration prospect, approximately 45 kilometers to the north. Following Bonboni, the Valiant will return to flow test the Sapakara South-1 well. Drilling activities continue at the Keskesi South-1 appraisal well with the Maersk developer. 
On Block 53, where APA is the operator and 45% working interest owner, we recently signed a contract with Noble Corporation to secure a drillship that will commence exploration operations in the first quarter of 2022. 
Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to comment on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Oil prices year-to-date have averaged well above our original budgeted level of $45 WTI. And more recently, gas and NGL prices have also begun to significantly exceed budgeted levels. This has created a very welcome amount of incremental free cash flow and will enable substantial progress on debt reduction this year. More importantly, our 2021 capital program will remain unchanged at $1.1 billion, even if we decide to add a third rig in the U.S. later this year. 
In June, we opened our Houston and Midland offices and began welcoming back the majority of our office staff as permitted by regional guidelines. It has been great to see more in-person collaboration in settings that we took for granted prior to COVID-19, and we will remain diligent with our protocols to keep employees safe. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on the second quarter and our 2021 outlook."
169838,1674490186,2364994,"APA Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. These results include i",674,"Thank you, John. As noted in our news release issued yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported second quarter 2021 consolidated net income of $316 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. These results include items that are outside of core earnings. 
Excluding the second quarter impacts of divestiture gains, movements in our tax valuation allowance, mark-to-market derivative losses and other smaller items, adjusted net income was $266 million or $0.70 per share. Most of our financial results were in line or better than guidance this quarter, with just a few minor exceptions. 
As we've discussed in the past, we continuously review our portfolio for the right time to monetize assets that no longer compete for funding. In the second quarter, we closed the sales of 2 such packages in the Central Basin platform. These were mostly lower margin conventional waterflood assets, which we're producing roughly 2,500 barrels of oil per day. Proceeds from the sales were $178 million. 
As we look forward to the rest of 2021, we are updating some of our full year guidance items. We are effectively increasing U.S. production guidance by 4,500 BOEs per day and decreasing international adjusted production guidance by 14,500 BOEs per day compared to the midpoint of the previous respective ranges. This net decrease of 10,000 BOEs per day for the full year reflects the strong underlying performance of our U.S. assets, but it also captures the impact of a few offsets, the unplanned operational downtime in the North Sea, the impact of higher oil prices on Egypt cost recovery barrels and the recent Permian Basin asset sales. We are reducing full year DD&A guidance by $125 million, which reflects a combination of price-related reserve additions and the impact of our changing production mix with lower North Sea volumes and higher U.S. volumes. 
Finally, other than an increase to our expected U.K. tax expense due to strong commodity prices, there are no material changes to the remainder of our guidance for the year. On a longer-term perspective, one of our most important strategic goals is to return to investment-grade status, which will require a significant reduction in debt. In the near term, progress towards this goal takes priority over the capital program, which, today, is still below a sustaining level of development capital. In other words, we are willing to under-invest slightly in the short term to build balance sheet strength and financial resilience for the longer term. 
We entered 2021 anticipating a multiyear process of debt reduction. With this price environment, we're making significant progress more quickly than we thought possible. In the first half of the year, at an average WTI price of $62, we delivered upstream-only free cash flow, which excludes dividends received from Altus Midstream of $860 million. Assuming current strip prices for the second half of 2021, upstream-only free cash flow for the full year is expected to be around $1.7 billion. The vast majority of this cash will be available for debt reduction. 
The rating agencies will ultimately decide when we return to investment grade, but we will clearly make significant progress in 2021. With meaningful progress on debt in sight, we would remind everyone that we have a strong portfolio of investable inventory, and it would be prudent to at least increase development capital to a production sustaining level. We estimate this would require around $1.2 billion of annual investment versus the $900 million we are investing in development capital this year. 
At this investment pace, and assuming prices remain flat with 2021, as we look out to the next several years, APA is capable of generating upstream-only free cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion annually. This is all based on our current portfolio of assets. And to highlight what the current portfolio can deliver, this analysis assumes no further investment or future benefit from Suriname and no free cash flow uplift associated with Egypt modernization, which is still pending. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

And John said it gets confusing because of the same numbers. But John talked about 2021 being",698,"Yes, Doug, and let me actually put some parameters around the whole $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow that I talked about in my prepared remarks. 
And John said it gets confusing because of the same numbers. But John talked about 2021 being $1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that's based on first half actual prices plus the second half strip, and that is our internal most current outlook for the business for the full year. 
In 2022, we say $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of free cash flow, and that is sustainable for a run of years, and we can talk about that a bit. I'd put 2 caveats on that. Number one, we're not attempting in any way to give guidance for '22 and beyond at this point in time. That's a hypothetical case. But I want people to understand that, that's a very realistic case. We know our inventory today better than we've ever known it. And we put together a realistic case based on what we would actually invest in, in the current price environment. 
As I said in my remarks, it is focused on the current portfolio. So we've kind of chosen to eliminate the noise associated with Suriname. It doesn't have any future Suriname CapEx. No future Suriname production or free cash flow. And just to be clear, we don't want that to be -- to come across as any reflection on our feelings about Suriname because that doesn't reflect that at all. 
The prices that we used in that case are exactly the same as the 2021 prices because I didn't want those to affect the comparability of the results. The CapEx, as we know, 2021 is $1.1 billion. In our hypothetical case for '22 and beyond, it's $1.2 billion. There's a difference though. The $1.1 billion includes $200 million of exploration spend, which is mostly focused on Suriname exploration and appraisal. So there's only $900 million of development capital in there. 
The $1.2 billion for '22 is all development capital. And we've talked about a number slightly lower than that, $1.1 billion is sustaining capital development -- capital spending. That was when we were talking about sustaining oil production volume. The case that we've put together now sustains -- the $1.2 billion sustains BOEs on a per day basis. So it actually is full production sustaining for a run of years that's adding capital to -- mostly to Egypt and to the U.S. 
Under this case, there's a slight decline in volume from '21 to '22 on an annualized basis, but then it's sustained from 2022 forward. So some people might be wondering, okay, you're spending $100 million more of CapEx and you have a lower volume, but free cash flow is roughly the same from '21 to '22. How do you do that? 
First, there's debt paydown assumed in that. So there's less interest expense. Because we are going to pay down somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion of debt, a little more than that, including what was on the revolver at the beginning of the year. And then the other thing that people may not fully appreciate is that the forward look. Our production mix is changing. The spending will create a decline in gas volume and growth in oil volumes. So again, prior case, we talked about was a lower capital because it was just sustaining oil volume. This one is sustaining total volume, but growing oil relative to gas. 
And again, a reminder, that doesn't include anything in there for Egypt PSC modernization, which is going to be meaningful. The specific question that you had about the -- how long this is sustainable. If we want to get into the inventory, I'd let David Pursell take that. I'll give him a chance to make a comment here quickly. But this is -- when I say for a run of years, I'll stick with the comment I made last time you asked me this question, Doug, and that is this is at least for 5 to 10 years that we can see out into the future. 
Dave, you have anything to add?"

So like Egypt post PSC would be growing the North Sea. 
I previously talked about 1 rig 1 platform can kind of maintain volumes with that 55,000 to 60,000 range. Obviously, first half of this year due to the extended maintenance, you're a good bit below that. So just by default, the North Sea is going to be up a decent bit in '22 versus '21. And then the Permian, it sounds likely -- the base case sounds like it would be to add the third rig in the Permian at year-end '21, which gets that back to sort of a flattish sort of a sustained sort of profile.

Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction.

Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard, and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow. 
First, we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters, primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S.
Second, we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet, it's the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework. 
We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio, primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded, and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022. 
With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share. 
In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group, and that this framework delivers an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders.
Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continue to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High and the Austin Chalk. 
Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production-sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the U.K. and Egypt will increase in the fourth quarter. 
In the U.S., we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the Southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High, no new wells were placed on production during the quarter, but performance from this year's DUC completions as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations. 
In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 4 operated wells earlier this year, 2 of which are on production. We recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A.
Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has begun to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio. 
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continue to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime.
On the drilling front, we recently TD-ed the STORE-2 development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was met, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay in other targets, which we are projecting will IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2,500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months. 
In Block 58 offshore Suriname, our partner, Total, is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sapakara South and the other is drilling the Bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing, and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs. 
On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners Petronas and Cepsa. The Noble Jerry DeSouza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter. The plan is to drill 1 well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for 2 additional wells if warranted.
Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details.
In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flaring intensity in the U.S. was only 0.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. 
Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year. 
We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance initiatives and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short-, medium- and long-term ESG goals, which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions, and we look forward to discussing these in the near future.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook."
169838,1685253382,2425373,"APA Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John.

In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability review, aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw, and provide some more context around our free cash flow outlook and capital framework. 
As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the impact of the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share. 
Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation, and we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs, which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter. 
I'd like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood's most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations. 
Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another. 
Accordingly, in the third quarter, we brought on to our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million. 
As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million, and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security. 
A few weeks ago, our majority owned midstream company, Altus, announced that it will combine with the parent company of EagleClaw Midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altus for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position. 
Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow, a portion of which would be deployed in the Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company. 
Reducing our ownership interest in Altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream-only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30. As we proceed toward closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction.
With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022 we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further noncore U.S. onshore asset divestments. 
I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free cash flow generation capacity and its anticipated uses. As always, there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow, so we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we publish with every quarterly earnings report. 
In the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed the 60% framework in the current quarter. 
Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the planned level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname. 
The near-term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active, and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization.
Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in February. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years when we've been on the road and in our meetings, Steve and I have been really clear that a quality E&P needs to have a strong balance sheet. You need to have a sustaining to low-growth profile, multiple years of inventory but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders. 
We've had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you one to two a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend. 
We're not big fans of a variable dividend I mean in terms of how that works, And I think with where our share price is especially today is as cheap as it is that, that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?"

Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been. 
I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth, and really little or no returns to shareholders. And more recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out, well, what's the right return framework. And I'd say it's kind of early days for the industry in general, and we're all kind of figuring that out now. 
The returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow, and I think that's probably good ranges out there are pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. And we're probably going to find a sweet spot in there, and I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry. 
For APA specifically, I mean we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the company with the debt tender this fall, and that was 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the balance sheet, and we'll get to that. 
But -- and to be clear, we still want to get to investment grade. But that can take some time, and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important, too. And we need to find a balance in returns to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet. 
And the industry has chosen 50% because they're kind of migrating toward that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance for APA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. 
It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many, many years. And remember, free cash flow, the basis for the returns calculation is after capital spending. 
So we've been improving the balance sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Up to 40% still available for other uses, including debt reduction. But I'd say in the near term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks. 
And remember also, we did talk about -- in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales. And that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance in the 60% level. 
As John indicated, we don't -- we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. And we'll consider -- we'll keep -- we'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general a smaller piece. 
And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now, we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield. It's one of the highest in the peer group. 
We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that. 
But for now, the share price is just too low, so we'll continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield, and it needs to be competitive against other E&Ps as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see as the typical ordinary dividend yield we see today. 
And we'll figure that out. It's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of balance sheet. That certainly is trending to something stronger, but also what price are we going to base all of that on. Because I think it's a valid question as to what we all think mid-cycle price is now. 
So we'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90%, and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. 
Probably more than you add up for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework."

We picked up another one that's in the Chalk now. we've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably middle of next year, which would put us 3. That will go to Permian. 
And quite frankly then, we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You'll be seeing those move. And with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads and see production, your short-term windows are kind of we're benefiting from those right now at Alpine now with the DUCs that we did earlier, right? 
So I think you're going to see a very well thought out efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those plays based on the how we've laid the inventory out and the infrastructure so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altus piece if we sell the -- sell down all those shares that we do put in there. But it will all fit into our framework. 
So it's nice to have quality inventory and options because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful. But you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way."

So remember on the Chalk, we talked about drilling a handful of wells in our Brazos County acreage position. One, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We've had significant experience a little bit to the west in the Washington County area. And we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together, and we like what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County and well results. 
And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position. 
The thing to remember, it's near infrastructure -- there's a lot of pipe in infrastructure in the area. It's less than 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component there too, which we like in these markets. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk. 
The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022, I think it's important to point out first of all that as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly. It's a couple of quarters to from the time you make that decision until the time you're turning to the right, just because of long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running. 
I think John highlighted that there's a lot to do in the Permian. We have 2 rigs in the Southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High. And we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig, and we'll post you on those in February.

But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. 
There -- these are -- so there are -- the nature of the assets there, they're a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them, a smaller number of them, are operating and still generating free cash flow. 
And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to. But we booked a net $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our balance sheet, $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligations. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about $450 million. 
That obligation won't -- we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest, in terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about $250 million, because we had to book an undiscounted number of the $450 million.
The other thing I just might comment on is that the way we went about doing the work -- because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been pouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at the abandonment costs. And we've looked -- the second priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. 
And then the third priority was to look at capital investment opportunities, because any assets like these are going to have uphole recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority. 
And we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that we think -- we thought were the highest priorities, seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows. 
But we think there are more. We think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs. And we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be -- we should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity."

Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow.
First, we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters, primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S.
Second, we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet, it's the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework.
We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio, primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded, and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022.
With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share.
In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group, and that this framework delivers an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders.
Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continue to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High and the Austin Chalk.
Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production-sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the U.K. and Egypt will increase in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the Southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High, no new wells were placed on production during the quarter, but performance from this year's DUC completions as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations.
In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 4 operated wells earlier this year, 2 of which are on production. We recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A.
Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has begun to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio.
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime.
On the drilling front, we recently TD-ed Storr-2 development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay in other targets, which we are projecting will IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2,500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months.
In Block 58 offshore Suriname, our partner, Total, is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sapakara South and the other is drilling the Bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs.
On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners PETRONAS and CEPSA. The Noble Gerry de Souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter. The plan is to drill 1 well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for 2 additional wells if warranted.
Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details.
In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flaring intensity in the U.S. was only 0.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year.
We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance, initiatives and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short-, medium- and long-term ESG goals, which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions, and we look forward to discussing these in the near future.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook."
169838,1685253382,2426243,"APA Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John.In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced comb",1161,"Thank you, John.
In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw, and provide some more context around our free cash flow outlook and capital framework.
As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the impact of the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share.
Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation, and we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs, which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter.
I'd like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood's most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations.
Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another.
Accordingly, in the third quarter, we brought on to our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million.
As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million, and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security.
A few weeks ago, our majority owned midstream company, Altus, announced that it will combine with the parent company of EagleClaw Midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altus for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position.
Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow, a portion of which would be deployed in the Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company.
Reducing our ownership interest in Altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream-only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30. As we proceed toward closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction.
With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further noncore U.S. onshore asset divestments.
I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free cash flow generation capacity and its anticipated uses. As always, there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow, so we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we publish with every quarterly earnings report.
In the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed the 60% framework in the current quarter.
Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the planned level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname.
The near-term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active, and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in February.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The backlog would be recovered over a 5-year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery. So it is all subject, the sum of all of that is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels.
The benefit, the real benefit as you've noted in your write-up, is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets. And that will allow us to get this backlog of costs recovered as well, especially in this price environment."

I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years when we've been on the road and in our meetings, Steve and I have been really clear that a quality E&P needs to have a strong balance sheet. You need to have a sustaining to low-growth profile, multiple years of inventory but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders.
We've had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend.
We're not big fans of the variable dividend, I mean, in terms of how that works. And I think with where our share price is, especially today is, as cheap as it is, that, that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?"

Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been.I think if",811,"Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been.
I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really little or no returns to shareholders. And more recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out, well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say, it's kind of early days for the industry in general, and we're all kind of figuring that out now.
The returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow. And I think that's probably good. The ranges out there are pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. And we're probably going to find a sweet spot in there, and I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry.
For APA specifically, I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the company with the debt tender this fall. And that was 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the balance sheet, and we'll get to that.
And to be clear, we still want to get to investment grade. But that can take some time, and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important, too. And we need to find a balance in returns to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet.
And the industry has chosen 50% because they're kind of migrating toward that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance for APA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many, many years. And remember, free cash flow, the basis for the returns calculation, is after capital spending.
So we've been improving the balance sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Up to 40% still available for other uses, including debt reduction. But I'd say in the near term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks.
And remember also, we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales. And that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance in the 60% level.
As John indicated, we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general a smaller piece.
And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now, we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield. It's one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that.
But for now, the share price is just too low, so we'll continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&Ps as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see as the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today.
And we'll figure that out. It's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of balance sheet. That certainly is trending to something stronger, but also what price are we going to base all of that on. Because I think it's a valid question as to what we all think mid-cycle price is now.
So we'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90%, and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you asked us for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework."

We've indicated we will be adding another rig, probably middle of next year, which would put us 3. That will go to Permian.
And quite frankly then, we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You'll be seeing those move. And with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads and see production, your short-term windows are kind of, we're benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the DUCs that we did earlier, right?
So I think you're going to see a very well-thought-out, efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those plays based on the, how we've laid the inventory out and the infrastructure so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altus piece if we sell down all those shares that we do put in there. But it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality inventory and options because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful. But you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way."

So remember on the Chalk, we talked about drilling a handful of wells in our Brazos County acreage position, one, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We've had significant experience a little bit to the west in the Washington County area. And we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together, and we like what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County and well results. And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position.
The thing to remember, it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe and infrastructure in the area. It's less than 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component there too, which we like in these markets. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk.
The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022, I think it's important to point out first of all that as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly. It's a couple of quarters to, from the time you make that decision until the time you're turning to the right just because of long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running.
I think John highlighted that there's a lot to do in the Permian. We have 2 rigs in the Southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High. And we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig, and we'll post you on those in February.

And some of those wells are in the public domain. And the results are very, very good, certainly exceeded our expectations. So there's a number of factors that would kind of drive us to really focus on Alpine as well as some of the other opportunities out there."

So Egypt sort of until at least Suriname gets to a point where it's at first oil, Egypt kind of becomes the growth driver for the company. And I'm just, I guess I'm just sort of curious when we think historically have been sort of like an 8-rig program or so and kind of keep production roughly flat. If we go 11 rigs plus, is this sort of like a double-digit-type growing asset? Just I guess any additional color how you're thinking about Egypt."

But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. The nature of the assets there, they're a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them, a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow.
And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to. But we booked a net $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our balance sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligation. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about $450 million.
That obligation, we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest in terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about $250 million because we had to book an undiscounted number of the $450 million.
The other thing I just might comment on is that, the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been pouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at the abandonment costs. And we've looked, the second priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the third priority was to look at capital investment opportunities because any assets like these are going to have up-hole recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority. And we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that we thought were the highest priorities, seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows.
But we think there are more. We think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs. And we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be, you should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity."

With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow g",1269,"Good morning and thank you for joining us.
Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow.
First, we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters, primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S.
Second, we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet, it's the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework.
We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio, primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded, and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022.
With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share.
In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group, and that this framework delivers an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders.
Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continued to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High and the Austin Chalk.
Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production-sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the U.K. and Egypt will increase in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the Southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High, no new wells were placed on production during the quarter, but performance from this year's DUC completions as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations.
In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 4 operated wells earlier this year, 2 of which are on production. We recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A.
Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has begun to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio.
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime.
On the drilling front, we recently TD-ed the Storr-2 development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay in other targets, which we are projecting will IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2,500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months.
In Block 58 offshore Suriname, our partner, Total, is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sapakara South and the other is drilling the Bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs.
On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners PETRONAS and CEPSA. The Noble Gerry de Souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter. The plan is to drill 1 well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for 2 additional wells if warranted.
Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details.
In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flaring intensity in the U.S. was only 0.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year.
We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance, initiatives and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short-, medium- and long-term ESG goals, which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions, and we look forward to discussing these in the near future.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook."

In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw, and provide some more context around our free cash flow outlook and capital framework.
As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the impacts of the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share.
Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation, and we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs, which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter.
I'd like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood's most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations.
Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another.
Accordingly, in the third quarter, we brought on to our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million.
As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million, and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security.
A few weeks ago, our majority owned midstream company, Altus, announced that it will combine with the parent company of EagleClaw Midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altus for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position.
Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow, a portion of which would be deployed in the Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company.
Reducing our ownership interest in Altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream-only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30. As we proceed toward closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction.
With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further noncore U.S. onshore asset divestments.
I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free cash flow generation capacity and its anticipated uses. As always, there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow, so we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we publish with every quarterly earnings report.
In the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed the 60% framework in the current quarter.
Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the planned level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname.
The near-term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active, and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in February.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

The backlog, while we haven't indicated exactly how much that is, the mechanism to recover that is that it is, the backlog would be, and we've shared this publicly already. The backlog would be recovered over a 5-year period on a quarterly basis. And that backlog would roll into the other costs for cost recovery. So it is all subject, the sum of all of that is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels.
The benefit, the real benefit as you've noted in your write-up, is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets. And that will allow us to get this backlog of costs recovered as well, especially in this price environment."

I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years when we've been on the road and in our meetings, Steve and I have been really clear that a quality E&P needs to have a strong balance sheet. You need to have a sustaining to low-growth profile, multiple years of inventory but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders.
We've had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend.
We're not big fans of the variable dividend, I mean, in terms of how that works. And I think with where our share price is, especially today is, as cheap as it is, that, that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?"

Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been.
I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really little or no returns to shareholders. And more recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out, well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say, it's kind of early days for the industry in general, and we're all kind of figuring that out now.
The returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow. And I think that's probably good. The ranges out there are pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. And we're probably going to find a sweet spot in there, and I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry.
For APA specifically, I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the company with the debt tender this fall. And that was 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the balance sheet, and we'll get to that.
And to be clear, we still want to get to investment grade. But that can take some time, and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important, too. And we need to find a balance in returns to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet.
And the industry has chosen 50% because they're kind of migrating toward that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance for APA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many, many years. And remember, free cash flow, the basis for the returns calculation, is after capital spending.
So we've been improving the balance sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Up to 40% still available for other uses, including debt reduction. But I'd say in the near term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks.
And remember also, we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales. And that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance in the 60% level.
As John indicated, we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general a smaller piece.
And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now, we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield. It's one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that.
But for now, the share price is just too low, so we'll continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&Ps as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see as the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today.
And we'll figure that out. It's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of balance sheet. That certainly is trending to something stronger, but also what price are we going to base all of that on. Because I think it's a valid question as to what we all think mid-cycle price is now.
So we'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90%, and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you asked us for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework."

And quite frankly then, we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You'll be seeing those move. And with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads and see production, your short-term windows are kind of, we're benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the DUCs that we did earlier, right?
So I think you're going to see a very well-thought-out, efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those plays based on the, how we've laid the inventory out and the infrastructure so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altus piece if we sell down all those shares that we do put in there. But it will all fit into our framework.

So remember on the Chalk, we talked about drilling a handful of wells in our Brazos County acreage position, one, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We've had significant experience a little bit to the west in the Washington County area. And we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together, and we like what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County and well results. And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position.
The thing to remember, it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe and infrastructure in the area. It's less than 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component there too, which we like in these markets. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk.
The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022, I think it's important to point out first of all that as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly. It's a couple of quarters to, from the time you make that decision until the time you're turning to the right just because of long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running.
I think John highlighted that there's a lot to do in the Permian. We have 2 rigs in the Southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High. And we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig, and we'll post you on those in February. But you can imagine that Alpine would be on that list of places we'd be looking to drill next year."

But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. The nature of the assets there, they're a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them, a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow.
And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to. But we booked a net $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our balance sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligation. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about $450 million.
That obligation, we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest in terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about $250 million because we had to book an undiscounted number of the $450 million.
The other thing I just might comment on is that, the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been pouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at the abandonment costs. And we've looked, the second priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the third priority was to look at capital investment opportunities because any assets like these are going to have up-hole recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority. And we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that we thought were the highest priorities, seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows.
But we think there are more. We think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs. And we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be, you should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity."

Our top priority coming into 2021 was to continue strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction. With the significant recent strides in that regard and a favorable outlook for continued free cash flow generation, we are in a position today to announce some material changes in our capital investment plans and use of free cash flow.
First, we are moving toward a capital budget that will sustain or slightly grow global production volumes. This is being accomplished through a gradual ramp in activity over the next few quarters, primarily in Egypt where we are anticipating PSC modernization terms will be approved by year-end, but also in the onshore U.S.
Second, we are committing to a significant increase in cash return to shareholders. While a stronger commodity price environment has accelerated progress on the balance sheet, it's the quality and cash flow generating capacity of our core operating areas through a range of commodity price environments that are enabling our new capital return framework.
We have a substantial inventory of quality drilling opportunities throughout our portfolio. In addition to Egypt, which now has the deepest inventory in more than a decade, we also have significant potential in our onshore U.S. portfolio, primarily in the Southern Midland Basin, Alpine High and Austin Chalk. In this price environment, there are many compelling drilling opportunities that should be funded, and we anticipate adding a fourth onshore U.S. rig in 2022.
With regard to our new capital return framework, we are committed to returning a minimum of 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders. This begins with our base dividend, which in September we announced would increase to an annualized rate of $0.25 per share. Yesterday, we announced a doubling of that rate to $0.50 per share.
In early October, we took the more significant step of initiating a share repurchase program. Through October 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares and expect to continue returning capital in this manner through the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our commitment is to return at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders and we will exceed this amount in the current quarter. We believe that APA currently offers one of the highest free cash flow yields in our peer group, and that this framework delivers an attractive and highly competitive return to our shareholders.
Turning now to the third quarter results and highlights. Through a combination of strong commodity prices, capital and cost discipline and good well performance, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, making it our strongest quarter of the year thus far. We anticipate fourth quarter will be even stronger. U.S. production exceeded guidance in the third quarter as we continued to see good performance in the Permian oil plays, Alpine High and the Austin Chalk.
Internationally, production was a bit below guidance as we experienced some extended maintenance turnarounds and compressor outages in the North Sea and lower volumes in Egypt associated with the impact of strengthening oil prices on our production-sharing contracts. We expect gross production in both the U.K. and Egypt will increase in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., we placed a total of 10 wells online during the quarter. This included 9 wells in the Southern Midland Basin, 3 of which were 3 miles in length. At Alpine High, no new wells were placed on production during the quarter, but performance from this year's DUC completions as well as the underlying base production volumes continue to exceed expectations.
In the East Texas Austin Chalk, we drilled 4 operated wells earlier this year, 2 of which are on production. We recently added a third rig in the U.S., which will be used to continue the delineation of our Austin Chalk acreage position. We have now gathered a substantial amount of data in this play that indicates returns will compete with other quality portfolio opportunities. Dave Pursell can provide more details around the Austin Chalk during the Q&A.
Turning to international operations. In Egypt, gross production has begun to turn higher, putting us on a good trajectory as we enter 2022. In anticipation of modernized PSC terms, we recently increased our rig count to 11. We will likely add more rigs in 2022 as modernized terms would return Egypt to being the most attractive investment opportunity within our portfolio.
In the North Sea, we continue to operate 1 floating rig and 1 platform crew. As expected, production was up modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as we continued to work through both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime.
On the drilling front, we recently TD-ed the Storr-2 development well, which we plan to place online in January. While one of the primary objectives in this well was wet, we encountered more than 300 feet of net pay in other targets, which we are projecting will IP around 20 million cubic feet per day of gas and 2,500 barrels per day of condensate. Our 59% working interest in this well provides good leverage to what should be robust North Sea natural gas and condensate prices over the coming months.
In Block 58 offshore Suriname, our partner, Total, is currently running 2 rigs, one of which is conducting a flow test at Sapakara South and the other is drilling the Bonboni exploration well in the northern portion of the block. These operations are still ongoing and the data we collect will help inform the next steps in the Block 58 appraisal and exploration programs.
On Block 53, we are finalizing plans for our next exploration well location with partners PETRONAS and CEPSA. The Noble Gerry de Souza drillship is scheduled to commence drilling this well in the first quarter. The plan is to drill 1 well in Block 53 in 2022, but we have an option on the drillship for 2 additional wells if warranted.
Before closing, I want to comment on the charge we took this quarter related to the Gulf of Mexico properties we sold to Fieldwood in 2013. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have independently assessed the situation and have elected to book the contingent liability that you saw in our press release. Steve will walk you through some of the details.
In closing, I'd like to make a few remarks about the progress we are making on the ESG front. We recently announced that we have eliminated all routine flaring in U.S. operations. This was an ambitious goal that we set at the beginning of the year and achieved 3 months ahead of schedule. Additionally, through the end of the third quarter, flaring intensity in the U.S. was only 0.38%, significantly below our target of less than 1%. Our global safety performance has also been strong. We have delivered a 35% improvement in our total recordable incident rate compared to this time last year.
We have also progressed a number of important initiatives that foster diversity and inclusion within the organization and that enhance the health and well-being of our employees. In October, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which I hope you will review for a more in-depth look at our ESG philosophy, performance, initiatives and success stories. Finally, we are in the process of establishing some very rigorous short-, medium- and long-term ESG goals, which will include further efforts on GHG and methane emissions, and we look forward to discussing these in the near future.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Steve Riney, who will provide additional details on our third quarter results and outlook."
169838,1685253382,2461192,"APA Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","APA Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John.In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced comb",1161,"Thank you, John.
In my prepared remarks this morning, I'll make some additional comments on our third quarter performance, provide a bit more color on the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, review aspects of Altus Midstream's recently announced combination with EagleClaw, and provide some more context around our free cash flow outlook and capital framework.
As noted in our news release yesterday, under generally accepted accounting principles, APA Corporation reported a third quarter 2021 consolidated loss of $113 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. These results include a number of items that are outside of core earnings. Excluding the impacts of the Fieldwood-related contingent liability, a loss on extinguishment of debt, a charge for tax-related valuation allowance, and some other smaller items, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $372 million or $0.98 per share.
Most of our financial results were in line with or better than guidance this quarter. Upstream capital investment was considerably below guidance, primarily due to the timing of infrastructure spending in Egypt and lower exploration costs in Suriname. Our teams have done a good job holding the line on capital and LOE despite service cost inflation, and we expect these will finish the year at or below our original 2021 guidance. G&A was also below guidance this quarter, mostly due to the timing of some costs, which we now expect to be incurred in the fourth quarter.
I'd like to provide a bit more color now on the Fieldwood ARO situation. Through Fieldwood's most recent bankruptcy process, we had to rely on third-party estimates of the remaining net abandonment obligations related to our legacy properties. Since Fieldwood emerged from bankruptcy in August, we have conducted our own evaluations.
Based on that work, it appears the combination of the various financial security packages and the anticipated future net cash flows from the properties will not be sufficient to fund all of the remaining abandonment obligations. Accounting rules require that the entire undiscounted contingent obligation and the offsetting undiscounted value of the financial security will be brought onto our books. These are recorded independently as a liability and an asset without netting them against one another.
Accordingly, in the third quarter, we brought on to our books the anticipated net ARO obligation of $1.2 billion. We also recorded the offsetting value of the financial security in the amount of $740 million.
As a reminder, the financial security includes a funded abandonment trust, letters of credit and surety bonds. As abandonment activity occurs, it will be funded first by the free cash flows currently being generated by the legacy properties. To the extent these cash flows are insufficient, Apache Corporation will be required to fund the activity and will be reimbursed through the financial security. Only after the operating cash flows and financial security packages are fully depleted will Apache Corporation be obligated to fund the activity without a source of reimbursement. The undiscounted net liability is $446 million, and we anticipate it will be at least 2026 before Apache incurs costs in excess of the available financial security.
A few weeks ago, our majority owned midstream company, Altus, announced that it will combine with the parent company of EagleClaw Midstream to form the largest integrated midstream company in the Delaware Basin. We considered a wide range of strategic options for Altus for more than a year. Ultimately, we determined that this transaction would allow all Altus shareholders to reposition equity holdings into a pro forma company with the best combination of scale, synergies, asset quality and attractive growth opportunities. The transaction would also preserve the $6 per share annual cash dividend for the public shareholders and provide near-term optionality for APA to monetize a meaningful portion of our current position.
Such a secondary sale would benefit the combined company by improving the public float. It would also provide APA with cash flow, a portion of which would be deployed in the Alpine High activity, thereby enhancing dedicated sources of revenue for the company.
Reducing our ownership interest in Altus to a minority position provides a number of benefits for APA as well, including simplification of our financial reporting, increased comparability with our upstream-only peers, and improved leverage metrics upon deconsolidation of $1.3 billion of debt and preferred equity as of September 30. As we proceed toward closing, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2022, we will provide further detail around the accounting treatment and the financial statement impacts of this transaction.
With respect to portfolio management more generally, as we build the capital investment program to a level capable of sustaining or slightly growing production, you will see increasing activity in our core asset areas, primarily in the U.S. onshore and in Egypt. This will demonstrate both the quality and running room in our core assets as well as the need for a more accelerated pace of noncore asset divestments. As part of that, in 2022, we anticipate a minimum of $500 million of further noncore U.S. onshore asset divestments.
I'd like to close by reiterating some of John's comments regarding APA's free cash flow generation capacity and its anticipated uses. As always, there can be some confusion around a term like free cash flow, so we want to be clear what it means at APA. You will find our definition of free cash flow in our financial and operational supplement, which we publish with every quarterly earnings report.
In the fourth quarter of this year at current strip pricing, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $600 million, which would result in full year 2021 free cash flow of around $2 billion. Under our new capital return framework, a minimum of 60% of this free cash flow would go to ordinary dividends and share repurchases. And as John indicated, we expect to exceed the 60% framework in the current quarter.
Looking ahead to next year, we currently contemplate a capital budget of around $1.5 billion. This would consist of roughly $1.3 billion for development and $200 million for exploration and appraisal activities, mostly in Suriname. As we've indicated, we believe the planned level of activity would put our global total BOE production on a sustaining to slightly growing long-term trajectory. This excludes any future production contribution from Suriname.
The near-term allocation of capital would likely be biased to increasing oil production, which would offset declining gas and NGL production. That said, the commodity price environment is very active, and we have considerable flexibility within our portfolio to redirect capital as appropriate. Based on this investment level, we anticipate free cash flow in 2022 would again be in the neighborhood of $2 billion prior to any benefits of Egypt PSC modernization. Finally, I would like to caveat all of this with, as is customary, the final plan for 2022 will be reviewed in the fourth quarter call in February.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A."

So it is all subject, the sum of all of that is subject to the 40% limit on cost recovery barrels.
The benefit, the real benefit as you've noted in your write-up, is that by aggregating all of these into a single bucket for cost recovery purposes, you don't end up with stranded costs in any of the smaller buckets.

I'll just give a few comments here. It really should not come as a surprise that anybody that's engaged with us over the last several years when we've been on the road and in our meetings, Steve and I have been really clear that a quality E&P needs to have a strong balance sheet. You need to have a sustaining to low-growth profile, multiple years of inventory but not too many years of inventory. And we should be throwing off the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders.
We've had a lot of work to do that the volatile pricing environment has at times impacted. But we're in a position where we're finally here. If you look at the framework, we believe you want to do a nice mix. You need a competitive dividend.
We're not big fans of the variable dividend, I mean, in terms of how that works. And I think with where our share price is, especially today is, as cheap as it is, that, that would be the primary means of how we'd look at it. Steve, any more specifics you want to provide?"

Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been.I think if",811,"Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks for the question because I think it is important to share some of the context around the framework that we've rolled out today. And I think John framed it exactly right in terms of the history of where we've been.
I think if you just step back and think about the industry, it wasn't too long ago that the industry was all about growth and really little or no returns to shareholders. And more recently, we've finally gotten to where it's about moderated growth ambitions and really starting to roll out these returns frameworks. And I think the big step right now is to figure out, well, what's the right return framework? And I'd say, it's kind of early days for the industry in general, and we're all kind of figuring that out now.
The returns frameworks right now are migrating towards a percent of free cash flow. And I think that's probably good. The ranges out there are pretty broad. I see ranges from 25% all the way up to 75%. And we're probably going to find a sweet spot in there, and I think it's starting to migrate towards somewhere around 50% as an industry.
For APA specifically, I mean, we just took a significant step in improving the capital structure of the company with the debt tender this fall. And that was 100% focused on debt reduction. We know there's more to do on the balance sheet, and we'll get to that.
And to be clear, we still want to get to investment grade. But that can take some time, and that's okay. We do have to just recognize that shareholders are pretty important, too. And we need to find a balance in returns to shareholders, while at the same time continuing to improve the balance sheet.
And the industry has chosen 50% because they're kind of migrating toward that. We chose 60%. We think this is the right balance for APA. We have a quality diversified portfolio. It's exposed to a good range of commodity price and geographic mix. It's capable of sustaining free cash flow for many, many years. And remember, free cash flow, the basis for the returns calculation, is after capital spending.
So we've been improving the balance sheet. We can still continue to strengthen the balance sheet. Up to 40% still available for other uses, including debt reduction. But I'd say in the near term, we certainly have a bias for dividends and buybacks.
And remember also, we did talk about, in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're going to probably pick up the pace on noncore asset sales. And that's also a source of funds for continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, but also for potentially for more returns to shareholders as well. So we feel pretty good about that balance in the 60% level.
As John indicated, we're not particular fans of the variable dividends at this point in time. We'll continue to look at that for the future and consider how the market reacts to those. I think the variable dividend needs to be in general a smaller piece.
And just in terms of balancing dividends versus buybacks, for now, we're just happy to lean into buybacks. We believe our share price is too low. We've been discounting for several months now greater than 25% free cash flow yield. It's one of the highest in the peer group. We don't believe our base cash flow generating capacity is actually fully appreciated by the market. And we need to continue to work on that. We know that.
But for now, the share price is just too low, so we'll continue with leaning in on the buybacks. We know we need to have a competitive ordinary dividend yield. And it needs to be competitive against other E&Ps as well as the broader market. And I think that's probably higher than what we see as the typical 2% ordinary dividend yield we see today.
And we'll figure that out. It's about getting to a balance around what's the right strength of balance sheet. That certainly is trending to something stronger, but also what price are we going to base all of that on. Because I think it's a valid question as to what we all think mid-cycle price is now.
So we'll get on with raising the dividend as well. We just need to be thoughtful about that. It was only 18 months ago that we cut the dividend by 90%, and that was a pretty painful process. We're going to make sure we don't put ourselves in a situation where we have to do something like that again. Probably more than you asked us for, but I wanted to take the opportunity to lay out a lot of context around the returns framework."

And quite frankly then, we envision those rigs kind of working those assets in tandem. We're in pad drilling. You'll be seeing those move. And with the time it takes on the unconventional side to mobilize a rig, drill pads and see production, your short-term windows are kind of, we're benefiting from those right now at Alpine High with the DUCs that we did earlier, right?
So I think you're going to see a very well-thought-out, efficient capital program in the U.S., where we're moving those rigs around those plays based on the, how we've laid the inventory out and the infrastructure so we can maximize those returns. But there is a portion of the Altus piece if we sell down all those shares that we do put in there. But it will all fit into our framework. So it's nice to have quality inventory and options because then we can just really plan it out and be thoughtful. But you'll see activity across our Permian next year in a very thoughtful way."

So remember on the Chalk, we talked about drilling a handful of wells in our Brazos County acreage position, one, because we're trying to maintain optionality. We've had significant experience a little bit to the west in the Washington County area. And we had a decent acreage position put together and wanted to hold it together, and we like what we've seen so far. It's consistent with the geology we've seen in Washington County and well results. And so we really just want to leverage that experience. We liked what we saw and felt like it was time to put a rig there and continue to progress that position.
The thing to remember, it's near infrastructure. There's a lot of pipe and infrastructure in the area. It's less than 100 miles from Houston Ship Channel. So we're getting Henry Hub pricing and LLS pricing for the crude. The GORs are a little bit higher than what you typically see in the Permian. So there's a little bit of a gas component there too, which we like in these markets. So for us, it was a pretty easy decision on the Chalk.
The extra rig we talked about, the incremental rig in the middle of 2022, I think it's important to point out first of all that as we think about adding another rig, it's harder to stand up a rig quickly. It's a couple of quarters to, from the time you make that decision until the time you're turning to the right just because of long lead items and supply chain issues and to make sure that we have everything we need to keep that rig running.
I think John highlighted that there's a lot to do in the Permian. We have 2 rigs in the Southern Midland Basin. We have a lot of development inventory that we're not getting to, which includes Alpine High. And we have a lot of good opportunities for that rig, and we'll post you on those in February.

I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit more color in terms of inventory, kind of areal extent of where you guys have drilled. Is there kind of an acreage number you think is a sweet spot out there for you that would kind of give you just a number of years of inventory? And maybe just more color about what that rig is doing. Is it all development work? Is there going to be a mix of some exploration in there? Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color about what the one rig is doing and what you've seen so far?"

But I doubt that we would take over operatorship of those assets at this point in time. The nature of the assets there, they're a large inventory of properties that came out of Fieldwood. A number of them are in abandonment activity today. And a number of them, a smaller number of them are operating and still generating free cash flow.
And I won't go through the details unless somebody wants me to. But we booked a net $1.2 billion liability on our balance sheet. That's the gross abandonment obligation less the free cash flows that we see coming out of those assets for their remaining life. And then we also booked on the asset side of our balance sheet $740 million of various forms of financial security that we have in place to fund that abandonment obligation. So a net liability on our part, a net obligation of about $450 million.
That obligation, we won't actually start funding anything on that obligation until 2026 at the soonest in terms of costs that could be incurred that we wouldn't have any form of reimbursement for. And then that would carry over for about 5 or 6 years after 2026 in terms of that situation. The present value of all of those costs today are about $250 million because we had to book an undiscounted number of the $450 million.
The other thing I just might comment on is that, the way we went about doing the work, because we only got access to the raw data behind all of this in August and we've been pouring through that since we got that. We've looked hard at the abandonment costs. And we've looked, the second priority was to look at the operating assets and the cash flow from the PDPs on those. And then the third priority was to look at capital investment opportunities because any assets like these are going to have up-hole recompletion opportunities and things like that. That was the third priority. And we really haven't gotten through all of those. There are literally hundreds of capital investment opportunities. We got to the ones that we thought were the highest priorities, seemed like the best opportunities. And so those are included in the free cash flows.
But we think there are more. We think that there are opportunities to reduce the operating and overhead costs in the PDPs. And we believe there are probably more opportunities on the investment side that we just haven't been able to get to yet. So we'll be, you should be watching for those over the coming quarters. And that has a decent chance of possibly bringing that $450 million liability down over time. And that would also decrease obviously the present value of that opportunity."
