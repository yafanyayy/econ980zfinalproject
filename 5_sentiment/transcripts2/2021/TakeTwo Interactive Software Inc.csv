On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to acknowledge those who've been and continue to be affected by the global pandemic. No words can bring comfort to those who have suffered. However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to and enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are carrying selflessly for those in need, ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further these troubling times.
Turning to Take-Two. Due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continue to shelter at home, Take-Two to deliver operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions of Mafia Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences.
In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically-acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to date, the Cayo Perico Heist. Featuring a radical new approach to heist design as well as a new tropical island to explore, the Cayo Perico Heist is an all-new grand Theft auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a Heist with a crew of up to 4 or for the first time, plan, prepare and execute the daring island heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing the Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single-player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual night club and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs plus a host of updates across the entire world.
In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online's highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who return to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021.
Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and to date has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a standalone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC that, for the first time, allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array -- via an additional purchase. In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online, including new legendary animals and sitings missions for the Naturales Role, action-packed new missions for the Bounty Hunter Role, with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter License, plus Outlaw Pass #4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons, enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights, and there were more players including more new players in the month of December,than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018.
In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates throughout calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged.
Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favored among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series, each year, NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and has sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. In addition, during the third quarter, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48%, and recurring consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, MyCareer users and MyTeam users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter, 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices.
During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X with our beloved shooter-looter title, Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next-generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game on prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second and single player and online co-op plus support for 3 and 4 players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3's launch for next-generation platforms was well-received, and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content, including the release of the Designers Cut, which is the first of 2 offerings as part of the season pass to for all versions of the game.
Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings, led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA TOUR 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that, first and foremost, we're an entertainment company, and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love in the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program, PGA Tour 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K battlegrounds.
During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 30%, which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: Social Point live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, Word Life, World Chef and Tasty Town, outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment, and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years.
Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user, up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal '21. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rates ever as a result of these new and expanded live-ops features which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long term.
WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter, growing 16%. During the period, 2K launched season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew 8% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI.
As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased forecast for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021, and we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 to $3.42 billion.
In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term.
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

Turning to e-sports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of program tournaments and a first-of-its-kind league combine during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world, this off-season, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K League was given top honors at the Tempest Awards as part of the annual e-sports business summer. I'd like to congratulate League President, Brendan Donohue, and his team with these honors.

Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our lifeblood is our world-renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry, we are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings and currently have the largest, most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity.
To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly-disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience.

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.
Net bookings were $814 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally-delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer Worlds. During the third quarter, 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally, up from 44% last year.
Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. GAAP net revenue was $861 million, and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million, due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment.
We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash and short-term investments. Not included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters, which was included in restricted cash. As this amount not being considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for the quarter end would have been $2.7 million. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed, and the cash is no longer restricted.
Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from digital partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 on Steam. This decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter-at-home orders in March 2020.
We expect digitally delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings, which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. We project consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our title. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year's launch of the second DLC for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million.
Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 32% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots, and GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021.
We are again increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these 2 metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia Trilogy and PGA Tour 2K21.
We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year.
Our forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $750 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $650 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year, driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share.
In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value, driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and, of course, our industry-leading talent.

So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is, first of all, the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business; and second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K, continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue, we think, to have similar results. I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable with and excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis. We're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles, both new iterations of existing beloved franchises and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next 5 years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market, which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases."

I mean the folks at Rockstar Games intended to create a powerful single-player experience, a story-driven experience, and Rockstar has always been known for great stories and great single player experiences that they developed, in addition, a massive multiplayer opportunity over the past years. And I think it's a reminder, not that we needed one, that Rockstar Games can do both of those things at the highest possible level of execution in our business. There was a -- I think it was an argue mentioned a couple of years ago, not around here, not in this shop, but in some of our competitors' offices that single player is dead, that it's all about multiplayer. We didn't believe that. I said specifically and publicly that we didn't believe that. Our labels don't believe that, and we deliver an array of experiences that range from hyper-casual mobile to the most complex, the most robust single player and multiplayer experiences, and we intend to continue doing that."

In terms of frontline pricing for NBA 2K21, I think that worked out very much as expected and as planned. It's a premium offering at the highest possible level. The title was built from the ground up for next-gen. It's the first title here that has been created that way, and the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary. The title sold in over 8 million units. Now we haven't talked about pricing on other titles, so it'd be premature to discuss that. We'll talk about that on a title by title basis going forward. In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there. Most recently, Embracer is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart. And we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox, and they'll still be working with us some on Borderlands and other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago, and we're excited about how that deal has gone. We lost the Codemasters' deal to our friends out west. That was disappointing, but reflects our discipline in such matters.
So there is an awful lot going on. I tend to agree, Colin, that pricing can be pretty heavy. And we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that hasn't worked out. We're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we'll look for that and at times aggressively, but we have sort of -- we have a firm grasp on the hand calculator in one hand and on our approach, strategy and tactics and the other."

We're always looking over our shareholders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think, the most self-critical group I've ever run into. How do we maintain our commitment to quality by making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate about and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time? And the effect of that is that we can have long development cycles, and we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection, and all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed. Sometimes we fall short, but that's the goal. And if anything, these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder.
So yes, it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they put out material that they really believe in that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality, and that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be in. That means we don't necessarily know the exact release date, but what we do know is if we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true at 2K, and that's true at Social Point, and that's through at Private Division. And that's an unwavering commitment, and it's part of our strategy, and it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays off."

Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then, so you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement. But I can tell you, for sure, there are some things that have fallen out and some things that are back in. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But again, we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid as we get things through various milestones, so it will be changing over time. But we haven't provided any additional updates other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. And just to break it down a little bit for you in terms of what comprises that 93: so on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93, we would consider core gaming experiences; and 17 of them are sort of mid-core arcade style experiences; and 13 of them are what we consider to be casual experiences. About half of them, 47 of the titles, are from existing IP or sequels, and the rest of them are for our new intellectual properties. So we are making investments in new IP, very important, Strauss spoke about that earlier.
And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC or streaming, including 7 of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are on the list specifically for mobile. And also, from a business model perspective, 67 of the 93 are -- they're required to be purchased, and 26 are completely free-to-play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it, but we do expect that, that will be moving around as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years."

So obviously, the mobile component of our business is becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Dots, so we are very committed to it, not to mention mobile activity on our label levels, specifically at 2K with WWE SuperCard, et cetera, and some NBA properties. So we are highly invested in the mobile business, and we expect that it will be even growing part of our investment going forward. But it really does -- our strategy boils down to a few components, and the first really is focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space, and that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And we've been investing in that, obviously, over the past couple of years, specifically through M&A, but also now organically, now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those 2 acquisitions.
The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are games that are more or less port, so there could be site variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years, and we'll continue to do so where it's appropriate. And then the third component is really just bringing our core -- is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we did it with Mafia, we've done it with a number of our franchises where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use, and it can be used to enhance your core experience pretty much at the same time or maybe offline or when you're not in front of your television side of your console. So those are really the components of our strategy, but obviously, it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it, and we're investing more and more."

And now we're expecting record net bookings for fiscal '21, which represents 30% growth over our original guidance and year-over-year growth compared to fiscal '20. Also, we expect record adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow over $750 million, which is more than double our original estimate. So we'll see in May, we'll give you a little bit of an update at that point, so that's when we'll give you some more details on '22."

We follow what government requirements and suggestions are, and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open. No one is obligated to come to the office if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A+ job making remote work possible for our company. We've moved over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat, not even not at all. We had 1 title that was delayed Kerbal Space Program 2, that was it. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment, but I don't think it's impossible to do that when you've already gotten to know each other when you built a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't have any issues and in fact, continue to grow, and that's exactly what happened.
But -- and so in any case, I think morale may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever. And it has been taxing. And I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges, and I'm looking forward to it ending. So no, you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, ""Oh, this is a great idea, everyone will just work from home."" I think certain people may be able to work from home more if that's truly their interest. I think generally speaking, we'll benefit from being together as a group."

So do you anticipate, going forward, potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decrease need for marketing spend? And I guess building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either/or question, but do you think your time and Take-Two's capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar or 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there?"
371281,700826705,2198715,"Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2021",2021-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.","Executives","It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I t",455,"It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I think we'll continue to spend to support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. Where you see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously, you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to the extent that you have greater success, and that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins. And you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that, that would continue, but it will be entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have.
I think where you can have a little more confidence around growth and the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is inexorable and which is happening. And digitally-distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter, and we think that the world is heading towards more than that, and that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher-margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the cost related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits, and that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits, and that's our goal and our strategy.
And I think on your second question, thanks for the reminder, Karl, it's all of the above. We're adding to the teams at 2K and at Rockstar as they work on more properties and bigger properties. We are adding to the teams at Social Point and Private Division selectively as we work on new properties, and we have shown a willingness to acquire companies and add that way as well very, very selectively. So we're a growth business, and you'll see that on our headcount. I'm hopeful that our headcount essentially goes to production capacity, engineering capacity and doesn't go to fixed corporate overhead."

And then a question for either Strauss or Karl, you guys acquired Rufian Games -- or Rockstar acquired Rufian in late last year.

However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to and enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need, ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further these troubling times. 
Turning to Take-Two. Due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest-quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continue to shelter at home, Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions of Mafia: Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. 
In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically-acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. 
In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to date, the Cayo Perico Heist. Featuring a radical new approach to heist design as well as a new tropical island to explore, the Cayo Perico Heist is an all-new Grand Theft auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a heist with a crew of up to 4 or, for the first time, plan, prepare and execute the daring island heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing the Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single-player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual night club and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs, plus a host of updates across the entire world. 
In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online's highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who return to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and, to date, has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a stand-alone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC that, for the first time, allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array -- via an additional purchase. 
In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online, including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the Naturalist role; action-packed new missions for the Bounty Hunter role, with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter License, plus Outlaw Pass #4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons, enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights, and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates throughout calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. 
Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favored among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series, each year, NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and has sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. 
In addition, during the third quarter, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48%, and recurring consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter, 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. 
During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series  X with our beloved shooter-looter title, Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next-generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game on prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second and single player and online co-op, plus support for 3 and 4 players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3's launch for next-generation platforms was well-received, and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content, including the release of the Designer's Cut, which is the first of 2 offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 to for all versions of the game. 
Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA Tour 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that, first and foremost, we're an entertainment company, and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love in the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program, PGA Tour 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K battlegrounds. 
During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 30%, which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: Social Point live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, Word Life, World Chef and Tasty Town, outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment, and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. 
Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title, including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user, up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal '21. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rates ever as a result of these new and expanded live-ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long term. 
WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter, growing 16%. During the period, 2K launched season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew 8% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased forecast for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021, and we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. 
In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

This marks an exciting new chapter in the studio's history, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with Gearbox, including the long-term publishing relationship for the Borderlands franchise going forward and some unannounced projects that will be revealed over time.

Turning to e-sports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of program tournaments and a first-of-its-kind league combine during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world, this off-season, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K League was given top honors at the Tempest Awards as part of the annual e-sports business summit. I'd like to congratulate League President, Brendan Donohue, and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. 
Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our lifeblood is our world-renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry, we are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings and currently have the largest, most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. 
To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly-disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and in-game engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long term.

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are c",1240,"Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
Net bookings were $814 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally-delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer Worlds. During the third quarter, 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. 
GAAP net revenue was $861 million, and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. 
We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash and short-term investments. Not included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters, which was included in restricted cash. As this amount not being considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for the quarter end would have been $2.7 million. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed, and the cash is no longer restricted. 
Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from digital partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 on Steam. This decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter-at-home orders in March 2020. Therefore, we expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings, which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our title. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year's launch of the second DLC for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 32% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots, and GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. 
We are again increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these 2 metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. 
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy and PGA Tour 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. 
Our forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and to represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. 
We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $750 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $650 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and, of course, our industry-leading talent. 
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is, first of all, the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business; and second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K, continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue, we think, to have similar results. 
I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable with and excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis. We're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles, both new iterations of existing beloved franchises and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next 5 years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market, which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases."

There was a -- I think it was an argument just a couple of years ago, not around here, not in this shop, but in some of our competitors' offices that single player is dead, that it's all about multiplayer. We didn't believe that. I said specifically and publicly that we didn't believe that.

The title sold in over 8 million units. Now we haven't talked about pricing on other titles, so it'd be premature to discuss that. We'll talk about that on a title-by-title basis going forward. 
In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there. Most recently, Embracer is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart, and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us some on Borderlands and other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago, and we're excited about how that deal has gone. We lost the Codemasters' deal to our friends out west. That was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on. I tend to agree, Colin, that pricing can be pretty heavy, and we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that hasn't worked out. We're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we'll look for that and at times aggressively, but we have sort of a firm -- we have a firm grasp on the hand calculator in one hand and on our approach, strategy and tactics on the other."

We're always looking over our shareholders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think, the most self-critical group I've ever run into. 
How do we maintain our commitment to quality? By making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate about and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is that we can have long development cycles, and we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection, and all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed. Sometimes we fall short, but that's the goal. And if anything, these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. 
So yes, it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they put out material that they really believe in, that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality, and that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be in. That means we don't necessarily know the exact release date, but what we do know is if we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true at 2K, and that's true at Social Point, and that's true at Private Division, And that's an unwavering commitment, and it's part of our strategy, and it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays off."

But I can tell you, for sure, there are some things that have fallen out and some things that are back in. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But again, we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid as we get things through various milestones, so it will be changing over time. But we haven't provided any additional updates other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. 
And just to break it down a little bit for you in terms of what comprises that 93, so on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93, we would consider core gaming experiences, and 17 of them are sort of mid-core arcade style experiences, and 13 of them are what we consider to be casual experiences. About half of them, 47 of the titles, are from existing IP or sequels, and the rest of them are for our new intellectual properties. So we are making investments in new IP, very important. Strauss spoke about that earlier.
And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC or streaming, including 7 of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are on the list specifically for mobile. And also, from a business model perspective, 67 of the 93 are -- they're required to be purchased, and 26 are completely free-to-play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it, but we do expect that, that will be moving around as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years."

So obviously, the mobile component of our business is becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Dots, so we are very committed to it, not to mention mobile activity on our label levels, specifically at 2K with WWE SuperCard, et cetera, and some NBA properties. So we are highly invested in the mobile business, and we expect that it'll be even growing part of our investment going forward. 
But it really does -- our strategy boils down to a few components, and the first really is it focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space, and that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And we've been investing in that, obviously, over the past couple of years, specifically through M&A, but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those 2 acquisitions.
The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are games that are more or less port, so there could be site variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years, and we'll continue to do so where it's appropriate. 
And then the third component is really just bringing our core -- is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we did it with Mafia, as we've done it with a number of our franchises where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use, and it can be used to enhance your core experience pretty much at the same time or maybe off-line or when you're not in front of your television side of your console. So those are really the components of our strategy, but obviously, it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it, and we're investing more and more."

We -- it's done fantastically well. We've sold around 2 million units or so, which is a fantastic result, and we're just really getting started.

I think under any circumstances, post-pandemic, and hopefully, there will be post-pandemic, demand will be higher than pre-pandemic demand. I think it's quite clear that there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. And Activate, our media consultancy, confirmed that.

And when we originally projected sequential growth for fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21, our fiscal '21 guidance was projecting a decrease from fiscal 2020. And now we're expecting record net bookings for fiscal '21, which represents 30% growth over our original guidance and year-over-year growth compared to fiscal '20.

We follow what government requirements and suggestions are, and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open. No one is obligated to come to the office if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A+ job making remote work possible for our company. We've moved it over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat, not even not at all. We had one title that was delayed, Kerbal Space Program 2, and that was it. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. 
You -- I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment, but I don't think it's impossible to do that when you've already gotten to know each other, when you built a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't have any issues and, in fact, continue to grow, and that's exactly what happened.
But -- and so in any case, I think morale may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever, and it has been taxing. And I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges, and I'm looking forward to it ending. So no, you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, ""Oh, this is a great idea, everyone will just work from home.""

So do you anticipate, going forward, potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decrease need for marketing spend? 
And I guess building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either/or question, but do you think your time and Take-Two's capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar or 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there?"

I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I think we'll continue to spend to support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. Where you see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously, you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to the extent that you have greater success, and that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins, and you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that, that would continue, but it will be entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have.
I think where you can have a little more confidence around growth and the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is inexorable and which is happening. And digitally-distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter, and we think that the world is heading towards more than that, and that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. 
Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the cost related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits, and that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits, and that's our goal and our strategy."

On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to acknowledge those who've been and continue to be affected by the global pandemic. No words can bring comfort to those who've suffered. However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to and enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need, ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further these troubling times. 
Turning to Take-Two. Due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest-quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continue to shelter at home, Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions of Mafia: Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. 
In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically-acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. 
In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to date, the Cayo Perico Heist. Featuring a radical new approach to heist design as well as a new tropical island to explore, the Cayo Perico Heist is an all-new Grand Theft auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a heist with a crew of up to 4 or, for the first time, plan, prepare and execute the daring island heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing the Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single-player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual night club and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs, plus a host of updates across the entire world. 
In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online's highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who return to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and, to date, has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a stand-alone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC that, for the first time, allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array -- via an additional purchase. 
In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online, including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the Naturalist role; action-packed new missions for the Bounty Hunter role, with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter License, plus Outlaw Pass #4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons, enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights, and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates throughout calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. 
Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favored among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series, each year, NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and has sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. 
In addition, during the third quarter, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48%, and recurring consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter, 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. 
During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series  X with our beloved shooter-looter title, Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next-generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game on prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second and single player and online co-op, plus support for 3 and 4 players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3's launch for next-generation platforms was well-received, and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content, including the release of the Designer's Cut, which is the first of 2 offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 to for all versions of the game. 
Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA Tour 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that, first and foremost, we're an entertainment company, and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love in the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program, PGA Tour 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K battlegrounds. 
During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 30%, which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: Social Point live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, Word Life, World Chef and Tasty Town, outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment, and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. 
Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title, including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user, up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal '21. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rates ever as a result of these new and expanded live-ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long term. 
WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter, growing 16%. During the period, 2K launched season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew 8% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased forecast for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021, and we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. 
In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On January 27, 2K released the fourth roster update for WWE 2K Battlegrounds, which adds to the game's outrageous in-and-out-of-the-ring action.

Each pack in this pass features new civilizations and leaders and is also available for individual purchase. The final Frontier Pass pack will be released next month, and 2K will have more to share about that in the coming weeks. 
In addition, last week, Private Division launched their beloved space simulation, Kerbal Space Program on Tencent's WeGame platform in China. We are very pleased to build upon our successful partnership with Tencent and believe that releasing Kerbal Space Program on WeGame represents a great opportunity to expand the global community and bolster our offerings in China. 
On February 10, Private Division and Obsidian Entertainment will release the Outer World's Peril on Gorgon, the first narrative-led expansion for the critically-acclaimed darkly humorous sci-fi RPG for the Nintendo Switch. The expansion was released previously for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC and is available individually or as a discount as part of the Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which will also include the Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second expansion set to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this fiscal year and on Nintendo Switch later in calendar 2021. 
This spring, 2K will release the Director's Cut, the new add-on content for Season Pass 2 for Borderlands 3 that will be available for all released versions of the game. The Director's Cut add-on will include new missions, in-game content and behind-the-scenes extras. 
On behalf of our team, I would like to congratulate Gearbox Software on their recently announced merger with Embracer. This marks an exciting new chapter in the studio's history, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with Gearbox, including the long-term publishing relationship for the Borderlands franchise going forward and some unannounced projects that will be revealed over time. 
Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. In addition, during the second half of calendar 2021, Rockstar Games will bring the blockbuster hit, Grand Theft Auto V, to the latest generation of consoles.

Rockstar Games will share more detail on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. 
Turning to e-sports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of program tournaments and a first-of-its-kind league combine during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world, this off-season, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K League was given top honors at the Tempest Awards as part of the annual e-sports business summit. I'd like to congratulate League President, Brendan Donohue, and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. 
Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our lifeblood is our world-renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry, we are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings and currently have the largest, most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. 
To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly-disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and in-game engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long term.

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
Net bookings were $814 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally-delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer Worlds. During the third quarter, 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. 
GAAP net revenue was $861 million, and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. 
We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash and short-term investments. Not included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters, which was included in restricted cash. As this amount not being considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for the quarter end would have been $2.7 million. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed, and the cash is no longer restricted. 
Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from digital partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 on Steam. This decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter-at-home orders in March 2020. Therefore, we expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings, which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our title. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year's launch of the second DLC for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 32% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots, and GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. 
We are again increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these 2 metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. 
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy and PGA Tour 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. 
Our forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and to represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. 
We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $750 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $650 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and, of course, our industry-leading talent.

So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is, first of all, the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business; and second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K, continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue, we think, to have similar results. 
I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable with and excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis. We're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles, both new iterations of existing beloved franchises and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next 5 years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market, which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases."

The title sold in over 8 million units. Now we haven't talked about pricing on other titles, so it'd be premature to discuss that. We'll talk about that on a title-by-title basis going forward. 
In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there. Most recently, Embracer is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart, and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us some on Borderlands and other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago, and we're excited about how that deal has gone. We lost the Codemasters' deal to our friends out west. That was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on. I tend to agree, Colin, that pricing can be pretty heavy, and we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that hasn't worked out. We're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we'll look for that and at times aggressively, but we have sort of a firm -- we have a firm grasp on the hand calculator in one hand and on our approach, strategy and tactics on the other."

We're always looking over our shareholders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think, the most self-critical group I've ever run into. 
How do we maintain our commitment to quality? By making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate about and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is that we can have long development cycles, and we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection, and all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed. Sometimes we fall short, but that's the goal. And if anything, these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. 
So yes, it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they put out material that they really believe in, that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality, and that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be in. That means we don't necessarily know the exact release date, but what we do know is if we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true at 2K, and that's true at Social Point, and that's true at Private Division, And that's an unwavering commitment, and it's part of our strategy, and it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays off."

Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then, so you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement. But I can tell you, for sure, there are some things that have fallen out and some things that are back in. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But again, we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid as we get things through various milestones, so it will be changing over time. But we haven't provided any additional updates other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. 
And just to break it down a little bit for you in terms of what comprises that 93, so on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93, we would consider core gaming experiences, and 17 of them are sort of mid-core arcade style experiences, and 13 of them are what we consider to be casual experiences. About half of them, 47 of the titles, are from existing IP or sequels, and the rest of them are for our new intellectual properties. So we are making investments in new IP, very important. Strauss spoke about that earlier.
And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC or streaming, including 7 of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are on the list specifically for mobile. And also, from a business model perspective, 67 of the 93 are -- they're required to be purchased, and 26 are completely free-to-play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it, but we do expect that, that will be moving around as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years."

So we are highly invested in the mobile business, and we expect that it'll be even growing part of our investment going forward. 
But it really does -- our strategy boils down to a few components, and the first really is it focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space, and that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And we've been investing in that, obviously, over the past couple of years, specifically through M&A, but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those 2 acquisitions.
The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are games that are more or less port, so there could be site variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years, and we'll continue to do so where it's appropriate. 
And then the third component is really just bringing our core -- is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we did it with Mafia, as we've done it with a number of our franchises where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use, and it can be used to enhance your core experience pretty much at the same time or maybe off-line or when you're not in front of your television side of your console. So those are really the components of our strategy, but obviously, it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it, and we're investing more and more."

We follow what government requirements and suggestions are, and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open. No one is obligated to come to the office if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A+ job making remote work possible for our company. We've moved it over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat, not even not at all. We had one title that was delayed, Kerbal Space Program 2, and that was it. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. 
You -- I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment, but I don't think it's impossible to do that when you've already gotten to know each other, when you built a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't have any issues and, in fact, continue to grow, and that's exactly what happened.
But -- and so in any case, I think morale may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever, and it has been taxing. And I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges, and I'm looking forward to it ending. So no, you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, ""Oh, this is a great idea, everyone will just work from home."" I think certain people may be able to work from home more if that's truly their interest. I think generally speaking, we'll benefit from being together as a group."

So do you anticipate, going forward, potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decrease need for marketing spend? 
And I guess building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either/or question, but do you think your time and Take-Two's capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar or 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there?"

I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I t",352,"It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I think we'll continue to spend to support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. Where you see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously, you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to the extent that you have greater success, and that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins, and you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that, that would continue, but it will be entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have.
I think where you can have a little more confidence around growth and the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is inexorable and which is happening. And digitally-distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter, and we think that the world is heading towards more than that, and that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. 
Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the cost related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits, and that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits, and that's our goal and our strategy."

We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need, ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further these troubling times. 
Turning to Take-Two. Due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest-quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continue to shelter at home, Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions of Mafia: Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. 
In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically-acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. 
In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to date, the Cayo Perico Heist. Featuring a radical new approach to heist design as well as a new tropical island to explore, the Cayo Perico Heist is an all-new Grand Theft auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a heist with a crew of up to 4 or, for the first time, plan, prepare and execute the daring island heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing the Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single-player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual night club and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs, plus a host of updates across the entire world. 
In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online's highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who return to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and, to date, has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a stand-alone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC that, for the first time, allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array -- via an additional purchase. 
In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online, including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the Naturalist role; action-packed new missions for the Bounty Hunter role, with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter License, plus Outlaw Pass #4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons, enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights, and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates throughout calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. 
Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favorite among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series, each year, NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and has sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. 
In addition, during the third quarter, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48%, and recurring consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter, 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. 
During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series  X with our beloved shooter-looter title, Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next-generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game on prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op, plus support for 3 and 4 players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3's launch for next-generation platforms was well-received, and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content, including the release of the Designer's Cut, which is the first of 2 offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 to for all versions of the game. 
Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA Tour 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that, first and foremost, we're an entertainment company, and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love in the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program, PGA Tour 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K battlegrounds. 
During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 30%, which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: Social Point live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, Word Life, World Chef and Tasty Town, outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment, and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. 
Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title, including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user, up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal '21. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rates ever as a result of these new and expanded live-ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long term. 
WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter, growing 16%. During the period, 2K launched season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew 8% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased forecast for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021, and we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. 
In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

Turning to e-sports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of program tournaments and a first-of-its-kind league combine during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world, this off-season, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K League was given top honors at the Tempest Awards as part of the annual e-sports business summit. I'd like to congratulate League President, Brendan Donohue, and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. 
Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our lifeblood is our world-renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry, we are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings and currently have the largest, most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. 
To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly-disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and in-game engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long term.

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are c",1240,"Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
Net bookings were $814 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally-delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer Worlds. During the third quarter, 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. 
GAAP net revenue was $861 million, and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. 
We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash and short-term investments. Not included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters, which was included in restricted cash. Had this amount not been considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for the quarter end would have been $2.7 billion. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed, and the cash was no longer restricted. 
Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from digital partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 on Steam. This decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter-at-home orders in March 2020. Therefore, we expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings, which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our title. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year's launch of the second DLC for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 32% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots, and GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. 
We are again increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these 2 metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. 
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy and PGA Tour 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. 
Our forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and to represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. 
We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $750 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $650 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and, of course, our industry-leading talent. 
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is, first of all, the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business; and second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K, continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue, we think, to have similar results. 
I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable with and excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis. We're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles, both new iterations of existing beloved franchises and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next 5 years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market, which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases."

There was a -- I think it was an argument just a couple of years ago, not around here, not in this shop, but in some of our competitors' offices that single player is dead, that it's all about multiplayer.

The title sold in over 8 million units. Now we haven't talked about pricing on other titles, so it'd be premature to discuss that. We'll talk about that on a title-by-title basis going forward. 
In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there. Most recently, Embracer is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart, and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us on Borderlands and other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago, and we're excited about how that deal has gone. We lost the Codemasters' deal to our friends out west. That was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on. I tend to agree, Colin, that pricing can be pretty heavy, and we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that hasn't worked out. We're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we'll look for that and at times aggressively, but we have sort of a firm -- we have a firm grasp on the hand calculator in one hand and on our approach, strategy and tactics on the other."

We're always looking over our shoulders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think, the most self-critical group I've ever run into. 
How do we maintain our commitment to quality? By making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate about and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is that we can have long development cycles, and we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection, and all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed. Sometimes we fall short, but that's the goal. And if anything, these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. 
So yes, it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they put out material that they really believe in, that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality, and that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be, and it means we don't necessarily know the exact release date, but what we do know is if we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true at 2K, and that's true at Social Point, and that's true at Private Division, And that's an unwavering commitment, and it's part of our strategy, and it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays off."

Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then, so you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement. But I can tell you, for sure, there are some things that have fallen out and some things that are back in. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But again, we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid as we get things through various milestones, so it will be changing over time. But we haven't provided any additional updates other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. 
And just to break it down a little bit for you in terms of what comprises that 93, so on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93, we would consider core gaming experiences, and 17 of them are sort of mid-core arcade style experiences, and 13 of them are what we consider to be casual experiences. About half of them, 47 of the titles, are from existing IP or sequels, and the rest of them are for our new intellectual properties. So we are making investments in new IP, very important. Strauss spoke about that earlier.
And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC or streaming, including 7 of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are on the list specifically for mobile.

So obviously, the mobile component of our business is becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Dots, so we are very committed to it, not to mention mobile activity on our label levels, specifically at 2K with WWE SuperCard, et cetera, and some NBA properties. So we are highly invested in the mobile business, and we expect that it'll be even growing part of our investment going forward. 
But it really does -- our strategy boils down to a few components, and the first really is it focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space, and that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And we've been investing in that, obviously, over the past couple of years, specifically through M&A, but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those 2 acquisitions.
The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are our games that are more or less ports, so they could be slight variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years, and we'll continue to do so where it's appropriate. 
And then the third component is really just bringing our core -- is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we did it with Mafia. So we've done it with a number of our franchises where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use, and it can be used to enhance your core experience pretty much at the same time or maybe off-line or when you're not in front of your television set or your console. So those are really the components of our strategy, but obviously, it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it, and we're investing more and more."

We -- it's done fantastically well. We've sold around 2 million units or so, which is a fantastic result, and we're just really getting started.

I think under any circumstances, post-pandemic, and hopefully, there will be post-pandemic, demand will be higher than pre-pandemic demand. I think it's quite clear that there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. And Activate, our media consultancy, confirmed that.

And when we originally projected sequential growth for fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21, our fiscal '21 guidance was projecting a decrease from fiscal 2020. And now we're expecting record net bookings for fiscal '21, which represents 30% growth over our original guidance and year-over-year growth compared to fiscal '20.

We follow what government requirements and suggestions are, and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open. No one is obligated to come to the office if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A+ job making remote work possible for our company. We've moved it over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat, not even not at all. We had one title that was delayed, Kerbal Space Program 2, and that was it. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. 
You -- I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment, but I don't think it's impossible to do that when you've already gotten to know each other, when you built a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't have any issues and, in fact, continue to grow, and that's exactly what happened.
But -- and so in any case, I think morale may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever, and it has been taxing. And I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges, and I'm looking forward to it ending. So no, you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, ""Oh, this is a great idea, everyone will just work from home.""

So do you anticipate, going forward, potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decrease need for marketing spend? 
And I guess building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either/or question, but do you think your time and Take-Two's capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar or 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there?"

I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I think we'll continue to spend to support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. Where you see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously, you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to the extent that you have greater success, and that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins, and you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that, that would continue, but it will be entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have.
I think where you can have a little more confidence around growth and the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is inexorable and which is happening. And digitally-distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter, and we think that the world is heading towards more than that, and that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. 
Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the cost related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits, and that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits, and that's our goal and our strategy."

On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to acknowledge those who've been and continue to be affected by the global pandemic. No words can bring comfort to those who've suffered. However, we do remain hopeful that better days lie ahead and that we all may return to and enjoy our lives as we once did. We remain immensely grateful to frontline workers who are caring selflessly for those in need, ensuring the vaccines are being delivered and administered and helping the world navigate further these troubling times. 
Turning to Take-Two. Due to an incredibly strong holiday season coupled with our ability to provide consistently the highest-quality entertainment experiences, especially as many individuals continue to shelter at home, Take-Two delivered operating results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online, Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K, the Mafia Definitive Editions of Mafia: Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 reflects our development team's boundless passion, creativity and commitment to captivate and engage audiences. 
In the history of the entertainment industry, there's perhaps no experience that's more loved, more expansive, more critically-acclaimed and more successful than Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto V remains one of the most iconic titles ever released and continues to exceed our expectations, having sold in over 140 million units. In fact, in calendar 2020, more copies of Grand Theft Auto V were sold than in any other year except for 2013 when it first launched on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In addition, recurrent consumer spending on Grand Theft Auto Online outperformed our third quarter forecast and grew 28% year-over-year. 
In December, Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto Online's biggest update to date, the Cayo Perico Heist. Featuring a radical new approach to heist design as well as a new tropical island to explore, the Cayo Perico Heist is an all-new Grand Theft auto Online adventure in which players can choose to take on a heist with a crew of up to 4 or, for the first time, plan, prepare and execute the daring island heist all on their own. Notably, more than 50% of those playing the Cayo Perico Heist are engaging with this as a new single-player experience. Cayo Perico Heist also introduces an array of exciting new weapons and vehicles, a new virtual night club and social space for players to get together and experience the world's best DJs, plus a host of updates across the entire world. 
In addition, overall engagement with Grand Theft Auto Online continues to set new benchmarks as the title had more players in every month and for the entirety of calendar 2020 than in any other year since its launch. 2020 also marked Grand Theft Auto Online's highest participation rate ever by both new players and reactivated players who return to experience Rockstar Games array of new content offerings. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to achieve a new net bookings record in fiscal 2021. 
Red Dead Redemption 2 also outperformed and, to date, has sold in over 36 million units worldwide. In December, Rockstar Games released a stand-alone version of Red Dead Online on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC that, for the first time, allows new players who do not already own Red Dead Redemption 2 to experience everything Red Dead Online has to offer, including access to all future content updates. Players also have the option to unlock Red Dead Redemption 2 story mode via an array -- via an additional purchase. 
In addition, during the quarter, Rockstar Games released an array of content updates for Red Dead Online, including new legendary animals and sightings missions for the Naturalist role; action-packed new missions for the Bounty Hunter role, with the addition of the prestigious Bounty Hunter License, plus Outlaw Pass #4 and an assortment of new clothing, weapons, enhancements and more. As a result of these offerings, engagement with Red Dead Online reached new heights, and there were more players including more new players in the month of December than in any other month since its beta launch in 2018. In addition, Red Dead Online grew its audience and had more overall players in calendar 2020 than 2019. Rockstar Games will continue to support both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online with more content updates throughout calendar 2021 to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. 
Another beloved franchise that's both a perennial favorite among consumers and an integral contributor to our ongoing success is NBA 2K from 2K and Visual Concepts. Renowned for being our industry's leading basketball simulation series, each year, NBA 2K continues to reinvent how people experience basketball and its rich culture and influence. NBA 2K21 once again raised the bar for the series and was our first offering that was built from the ground up for next-generation consoles. The title boasts groundbreaking technological advancements, new modes and many exclusive robust features. To date, NBA 2K21 has exceeded our expectations and has sold in over 8 million units across all platforms. 
In addition, during the third quarter, net bookings for the NBA 2K series grew 48%, and recurring consumer spending significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 67%. Furthermore, consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong across daily active users, MyCAREER users and MyTeam users. Moreover, NBA 2K21 users have been more deeply engaged with the game with average games played per user up 14% as compared to NBA 2K20 in the same period. During the quarter, 2K expanded further the breadth of its NBA 2K offerings with the releases of NBA's SuperCard and NBA 2K Mobile Season 3 for iOS and Android devices. 
During the third quarter, 2K bolstered our initial offerings for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series  X with our beloved shooter-looter title, Borderlands 3. The title was fully optimized for next-generation consoles, making mayhem bigger and bolder than ever before. All players who own or purchase the game on prior consoles will be able to download the new platform upgrade within the same console family for free. This free upgrade will add several exclusive features, including 4K resolution at 60 frames per second in single player and online co-op, plus support for 3 and 4 players split screen co-op. Borderlands 3's launch for next-generation platforms was well-received, and we've seen the games user base grow steadily. 2K is supporting the title within game events and new content, including the release of the Designer's Cut, which is the first of 2 offerings as part of the Season Pass 2 to for all versions of the game. 
Our third quarter results were also enhanced by a variety of other offerings led by the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, the WWE series, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and PGA Tour 2K21. Driving engagement with our titles after initial launch remains among our most important long-term growth and margin opportunities and is a key strategic priority of our organization. We now support virtually all our new releases with innovative offerings to achieve this goal. That said, we're highly mindful that, first and foremost, we're an entertainment company, and we're in the service of our audience. We strive to give consumers more of what they love in the ability to stay captivated and engaged within their favorite experiences and passionate communities. To that end, during the third quarter, we released an array of free and paid add-on content for our popular hit releases, including Kerbal Space Program, PGA Tour 2K21, Sid Meier's Civilization VI and WWE 2K battlegrounds. 
During the third quarter, recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations, growing 30%, which was double our original outlook and accounted for 58% of net bookings. In addition to NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, the recurrent consumer spending was enhanced by the following offerings: Social Point live games, including Dragon City, Monster Legends, Word Life, World Chef and Tasty Town, outperformed during the third quarter and exceeded expectations. Live games delivered new fresh content, events and experiences to boost engagement and enhance players' enjoyment, and net bookings grew 39%. The studio continues to invest in its broad and innovative pipeline of new games planned for launch in the coming years. 
Playdots completed the rollout of their biggest feature update of the year for their popular Two Dots title, including competitive leaderboards. This update played a key role in driving average revenue per daily active user, up 12% as compared with the second quarter of fiscal '21. Two Dots is now experiencing its highest player conversion rates ever as a result of these new and expanded live-ops features, which continue to perform very well. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results and expect growth over the long term. 
WWE SuperCard also outperformed during the third quarter, growing 16%. During the period, 2K launched season 7 of this popular free-to-play sports entertainment mobile game. The title has now been downloaded more than 22 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. And NBA 2K Online in China grew 49% and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 51 million registered users. Add-on content grew 8% and outperformed expectations, led by offerings for the Borderlands Series and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
As a result of our better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased forecast for the remainder of the year, we're once again raising our outlook for fiscal year 2021, and we expect to achieve record net bookings of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion. 
In closing, Take-Two is exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize further on the positive trends of our industry to pursue our core mission to become the most innovative, creative and efficient entertainment company in the world and to deliver growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'll now discuss our recent and upcoming releases. On January 27, 2K released the fourth roster update for WWE 2K Battlegrounds, which adds to the game's outrageous in-and-out-of-the-ring action.

Each pack in this pass features new civilizations and leaders and is also available for individual purchase. The final Frontier Pass pack will be released next month, and 2K will have more to share about that in the coming weeks. 
In addition, last week, Private Division launched their beloved space simulation, Kerbal Space Program on Tencent's WeGame platform in China. We are very pleased to build upon our successful partnership with Tencent and believe that releasing Kerbal Space Program on WeGame represents a great opportunity to expand the global community and bolster our offerings in China. 
On February 10, Private Division and Obsidian Entertainment will release the Outer World's Peril on Gorgon, the first narrative-led expansion for the critically-acclaimed darkly humorous sci-fi RPG for the Nintendo Switch. The expansion was released previously for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC and is available individually or as a discount as part of the Outer Worlds Expansion Pass, which will also include the Outer Worlds Murder on Eridanos, the second expansion set to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC this fiscal year and on Nintendo Switch later in calendar 2021. 
This spring, 2K will release the Director's Cut, the new add-on content for Season Pass 2 for Borderlands 3 that will be available for all released versions of the game. The Director's Cut add-on will include new missions, in-game content and behind-the-scenes extras. 
On behalf of our team, I would like to congratulate Gearbox Software on their recently announced merger with Embracer. This marks an exciting new chapter in the studio's history, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership with Gearbox, including the long-term publishing relationship for the Borderlands franchise going forward and some unannounced projects that will be revealed over time. 
Throughout the year, Rockstar Games will continue to support both Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online, with more content updates to keep new and returning players excited and engaged. In addition, during the second half of calendar 2021, Rockstar Games will bring the blockbuster hit, Grand Theft Auto V, to the latest generation of consoles.

Rockstar Games will share more detail on the new versions of Grand Theft Auto V in the months ahead. 
Turning to e-sports. The NBA 2K League is gearing up for its fourth season that will take place later this year. After a series of program tournaments and a first-of-its-kind league combine during the fall, the league is currently prepping for this year's upcoming player draft. As part of the league's continued commitment to identifying the best players in the world, this off-season, the league is hosting a series of online qualifying events for international players and will award draft eligibility to top performers from each event. In addition, I'm pleased to share that for the second consecutive year, the NBA 2K League was given top honors at the Tempest Awards as part of the annual e-sports business summit. I'd like to congratulate League President, Brendan Donohue, and his team on these honors. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. 
Looking ahead, our organization is currently undertaking numerous initiatives that we believe will add scale to our business and drive continued success. As an entertainment company, our lifeblood is our world-renowned creative talent and portfolio of owned intellectual property. With nearly 4,900 colleagues around the world in our development studios that are home to some of the most commercially and critically successful brands in our industry, we are significantly expanding the breadth and depth of our offerings and currently have the largest, most diverse long-term product pipeline in our history. While we are excited by the potential of these future releases, we are still pursuing our goal of creating a more consistent release schedule and increasing our development capacity. 
To that end, we continually explore both organic and inorganic opportunities and maintain a highly-disciplined approach to ensure that our investments will be accretive to our shareholders and consistent with our strategy. In addition, we have always maintained a willingness to explore and experiment with new markets and business models that can both expand the reach of our content and broaden the scope of our audience. We are investing prudently to enhance our global infrastructure and resources that support our creative endeavors, including data analytics and in-game engagement with players. Through all these efforts, we believe that Take-Two is poised to generate growth and margin expansion over the long term.

Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
Net bookings were $814 million. This result exceeded our outlook of $675 million to $725 million, driven primarily by the outperformance of Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption 2. Digitally-delivered net bookings declined by 4% as compared to our outlook of a 15% decline and accounted for 82% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. Our third quarter results last year benefited from the launches of Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC and the Outer Worlds. During the third quarter, 56% of sales of console games were delivered digitally, up from 44% last year. Recurrent consumer spending grew 30% as compared to our outlook of 5% growth and accounted for 58% of total net bookings. This growth was driven primarily by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K. 
GAAP net revenue was $861 million, and cost of goods sold was $346 million. Operating expenses increased by 7% to $339 million due primarily to the addition of Playdots, higher personnel costs and IT expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 11% to $182 million or $1.57 per share as compared to $164 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP net income benefited from $40.6 million of realized and unrealized gains on a long-term investment. 
We ended the quarter with $2.42 billion of cash and short-term investments. Not included in this balance is the cash portion of our offer to acquire Codemasters, which was included in restricted cash. Had this amount not been considered still restricted as of December 31, our cash and short-term investments for the quarter end would have been $2.7 billion. As of January 13, 2021, the offer lapsed, and the cash was no longer restricted. 
Now to our guidance, starting with the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $602 million to $652 million compared to $729 million in the fourth quarter last year. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the recognition of higher license fees from digital partners to provide free downloads of certain games on their platform and from the launch of Borderlands 3 on Steam. This decline is also due to the initial surge in digital downloads at the onset of shelter-at-home orders in March 2020. Therefore, we expect digitally-delivered net bookings to be down approximately 10%. Digital is projected to represent 93% of total net bookings, which is in line with last year. Forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to be up approximately 5% due to continued engagement in our title. Virtual currency is driving this increase and is partially offset by lower add-on content due to last year's launch of the second DLC for Borderlands 3. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Two Dots, Borderlands 3 and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $702 million to $752 million and cost of goods sold to range from $267 million to $293 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 32% increase over last year driven primarily by higher marketing and research and development expenses and the addition of Playdots, and GAAP net income is expected to range from $102 million to $113 million or $0.88 to $0.98 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2021. 
We are again increasing our full year outlook, which now includes record net bookings and operating results. This will be the fifth consecutive year that these 2 metrics have grown. Our net bookings outlook range is now $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, up from our previous guidance of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion and original guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion. This is being driven by our third quarter outperformance along with an updated forecast for the fourth quarter, which has improved primarily due to higher recurrent consumer spending from Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K as well as strong performance from Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. We expect growth from the prior year from NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft V and Social Point's mobile games to be offset primarily by lower results from Borderlands 3. 
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Social Point's mobile games, Borderlands 3, Sid Meier's Civilization VI the Mafia Definitive Editions and Mafia: Trilogy and PGA Tour 2K21. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We now project digitally-delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 20% as compared to our prior outlook of 15% growth. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87% of net bookings, up from 82% last year. 
Our forecast assumes that 63% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. We now expect recurrent consumer spending to grow by approximately 45% as compared to our prior outlook of 30% growth and to represent approximately 64% of net bookings as compared to 51% last year. Growth is being driven primarily by NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online, the addition of Playdots and Social Point's mobile games. 
We are increasing our non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow outlook to more than $750 million, up from our prior outlook of more than $650 million. We plan to deploy approximately $75 million for capital expenditures. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.24 billion to $3.29 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.52 billion to $1.55 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase over the prior year driven by the addition of Playdots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $472 million to $484 million or $4.08 to $4.18 per share. 
In closing, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum that we have experienced so far in fiscal 2021, including our expectations to deliver both record net bookings and operating results for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our long-term growth trajectory and our ability to deliver shareholder value driven by our key competitive advantages, our incredible portfolio of creative assets, our strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet and, of course, our industry-leading talent.

So it's exciting that we have these extraordinary franchises that keep captivating and engaging consumers many years after launch. And the reason that that's occurring is, first of all, the initial quality, which is unmatched in our business; and second, because our labels, both Rockstar Games and 2K, continue to deliver content on an ongoing basis that further causes captivation and engagement. And if we keep doing that, then we'll continue, we think, to have similar results. 
I think you're right that consumers get really comfortable with and excited by specific franchises. And if you keep delivering great content, they will maintain their involvement on an ongoing basis. We're seeing that in all forms of the entertainment business. At the same time, we always have to create new titles, both new iterations of existing beloved franchises and new intellectual property. And if we don't do that, then we're burning the furniture. So to that end, in the next 5 years, we expect to bring 93 new releases to market, which is more than double what our development capacity was just a few years ago. So we're both excited by the continued growing engagement in our existing entities as well as what the future can bring with new releases."

The title was built from the ground up for next-gen. It's the first title here that has been created that way, and the acceptance by consumers has been nothing short of extraordinary. The title sold in over 8 million units. Now we haven't talked about pricing on other titles, so it'd be premature to discuss that. We'll talk about that on a title-by-title basis going forward. 
In terms of consolidation, you've seen a lot of deals out there. Most recently, Embracer is merging with Gearbox, a company near and dear to our heart, and we're grateful that we'll still be in business with Gearbox and they'll still be working with us on Borderlands and other titles. We acquired Playdots just a few months ago, and we're excited about how that deal has gone. We lost the Codemasters' deal to our friends out west. That was disappointing but reflects our discipline in such matters. So there is an awful lot going on. I tend to agree, Colin, that pricing can be pretty heavy, and we have a stated strategy and a disciplined approach. It served us well. We have yet to make an acquisition that hasn't worked out. We're looking for great teams, great intellectual property and for an arrangement that would be accretive to shareholder value. And we'll look for that and at times aggressively, but we have sort of a firm -- we have a firm grasp on the hand calculator in one hand and on our approach, strategy and tactics on the other."

We're always looking over our shoulders. We're always trying to figure out what we can do better. We're, I think, the most self-critical group I've ever run into. 
How do we maintain our commitment to quality? By making sure that our creative teams pursue what they're passionate about and don't pursue something they're not passionate about and by maintaining operational and financial discipline at the same time. And the effect of that is that we can have long development cycles, and we've been criticized for that. But I think the case that you're alluding to reflects the fact that you're always better served to wait for perfection if you can create perfection, and all of our labels are seeking perfection. And we don't always succeed. Sometimes we fall short, but that's the goal. And if anything, these times cause us to sharpen our minds further and sharpen our discipline further and try harder. 
So yes, it's great that Rockstar Games continues to put out add-on content and additional content for Grand Theft Auto Online and for Red Dead Online. But they put out material that they really believe in, that they're passionate about and that is of the highest possible quality, and that means we're not on a weekly cadence and we're not going to be, and it means we don't necessarily know the exact release date, but what we do know is if we will wait for it to be as close to perfect as anything can be. And that's true at 2K, and that's true at Social Point, and that's true at Private Division, And that's an unwavering commitment, and it's part of our strategy, and it comes from the top of the company. And we are prepared to accept the results when we fall short in terms of timing or when we sometimes spend a little more than we would like because it always pays off."

Of course, things move in and out all the time. It hasn't really been that long since then, so you can't really expect that there's going to be a significant amount of movement. But I can tell you, for sure, there are some things that have fallen out and some things that are back in. But generally speaking, these are still pretty good numbers in general. But again, we do expect that this pipeline will be fluid as we get things through various milestones, so it will be changing over time. But we haven't provided any additional updates other than the 93 initial announcement that we made. 
And just to break it down a little bit for you in terms of what comprises that 93, so on a high level, 63 of those titles of the 93, we would consider core gaming experiences, and 17 of them are sort of mid-core arcade style experiences, and 13 of them are what we consider to be casual experiences. About half of them, 47 of the titles, are from existing IP or sequels, and the rest of them are for our new intellectual properties. So we are making investments in new IP, very important. Strauss spoke about that earlier.
And then in terms of platforms, 72 of the 93 titles are planned for console, PC or streaming, including 7 of those that will also be available on mobile. So that would leave 21 that are on the list specifically for mobile. And also, from a business model perspective, 67 of the 93 are -- they're required to be purchased, and 26 are completely free-to-play. So that's the breakdown as it was the last time we did it, but we do expect that, that will be moving around as we go deeper into that pipeline and over the next few years."

So obviously, the mobile component of our business is becoming more and more important with our acquisition of Social Point and Dots, so we are very committed to it, not to mention mobile activity on our label levels, specifically at 2K with WWE SuperCard, et cetera, and some NBA properties. So we are highly invested in the mobile business, and we expect that it'll be even growing part of our investment going forward. 
But it really does -- our strategy boils down to a few components, and the first really is it focuses around new -- creating new IP for the mobile space, and that's around our Social Point and Playdots business. So it's IP that's created specifically for the mobile environment. And we've been investing in that, obviously, over the past couple of years, specifically through M&A, but also now organically now that we've got a pretty sizable platform between those 2 acquisitions.
The second component is bringing our core franchises to the mobile platforms. So these are our games that are more or less ports, so they could be slight variations of games, existing content that exists. So we've done that quite successfully for many, many years, and we'll continue to do so where it's appropriate. 
And then the third component is really just bringing our core -- is integrating a mobile experience with our core experiences. So these are things like companion apps, which we've done effectively with Red Dead Redemption, we did it with Mafia. So we've done it with a number of our franchises where you can have a separate mobile experience that you can use, and it can be used to enhance your core experience pretty much at the same time or maybe off-line or when you're not in front of your television set or your console. So those are really the components of our strategy, but obviously, it's a growing part of the industry. We're very tapped into it, and we're investing more and more."

We follow what government requirements and suggestions are, and we follow the science and the facts. Some of our offices are open. No one is obligated to come to the office if they're uncomfortable in doing so. That said, we've been extraordinarily productive. Our IT team did an A+ job making remote work possible for our company. We've moved it over to remote work within a week of needing to shelter at home. And we haven't missed a beat, not even not at all. We had one title that was delayed, Kerbal Space Program 2, and that was it. And more importantly, the quality of our releases has been extraordinary. 
You -- I appreciate the question about culture. I think it's actually difficult to build a culture in a remote work environment, but I don't think it's impossible to do that when you've already gotten to know each other, when you built a powerful company with a powerful business model and a powerful team. I think to the contrary, in a challenging time, everyone pulled together and knew that it was our collective job to make sure the company didn't have any issues and, in fact, continue to grow, and that's exactly what happened.
But -- and so in any case, I think morale may actually be stronger, but it's not something that can or should last forever, and it has been taxing. And I think people are actually working harder at home than they did in offices even though there is no commute. I think it creates a lot of challenges, and I'm looking forward to it ending. So no, you're not -- we're not one of those companies where we believe like, ""Oh, this is a great idea, everyone will just work from home."" I think certain people may be able to work from home more if that's truly their interest. I think generally speaking, we'll benefit from being together as a group."

So do you anticipate, going forward, potentially further operating margin benefits due to what might be a decrease need for marketing spend? 
And I guess building on one of the M&A questions earlier and this is definitely not an either/or question, but do you think your time and Take-Two's capital are probably better served adding to the teams you already have at Rockstar or 2K, where there already seems to be a pretty good culture of excellence there?"

I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I t",352,"It's a -- thank you for the question. I don't think you're going to see a reduction in our marketing spend because we're launching new iterations of existing franchises, and we're launching new intellectual property in a highly competitive market, and I think we'll continue to spend to support those releases. So I don't think you'll see leverage there. Where you see leverage, though, of course, is when you sell more units. So if you make bigger hits, and we make bigger hits than anyone else in the market, then obviously, you're amortizing that marketing spend across a larger number of units. So a marketing spend as a percent of your net bookings can be lower to the extent that you have greater success, and that's certainly our goal. And in that event, of course, we'd have higher operating margins, and you've seen that reflected in the growth in our operating margins, as you've seen the growth in our hits in the last 14 years. And I would hope that, that would continue, but it will be entirely driven by whatever success we have or don't have.
I think where you can have a little more confidence around growth and the margins would be in the shift to digital distribution, which is inexorable and which is happening. And digitally-distributed products were 82% of our net bookings in the quarter, and we think that the world is heading towards more than that, and that will help our margins as well as our competitors' margins. 
Also, of course, our recurrent consumer spending is higher margin because the cost associated with the content that drives recurrent consumer spending is lower than the cost related to an initial large release. So to the extent that we continue to deliver add-on content to beloved titles, which is our goal, you could see an increase in operating margins coming from that as well. But again, that's reliant upon creating hits, and that won't occur if we don't create more hits. So everything comes down to creating bigger and bigger hits, and that's our goal and our strategy."

And then a question for either Strauss or Karl, you guys acquired Ruffian Games -- or Rockstar acquired Ruffian late last year. I believe that they have a history in the shooter category with the Halo franchise specifically. So are they coming on board to broaden Rockstar's reach to genres like that?

Our strong fourth quarter performance concluded an exceptional year for our organization. We delivered net bookings of approximately $3.6 billion, which grew nearly 20% from fiscal 2020 and were the highest ever in our company's history. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results despite such significant unforeseen and prolonged challenges. It's truly a reflection of our collective resilience and singular commitment to excellence. Our thoughts are with those who have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19, we hope the better days and comfort will come to you soon. 
Throughout the pandemic, our creative teams have delivered consistently superlative entertainment experiences, giving players opportunities to have fun in the most difficult of times and stay connected with family and friends through shared experiences. We grew our online communities meaningfully, including new and returning players, which helped drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 48% to reach a record high and represents 63% of our total net bookings for fiscal 2021. 
During the year, we enhanced our organization for the long term. We bolstered the depth of our creative teams by hiring more than 700 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and grow our business. We also broadened our portfolio of offerings capitalized on diverse business models and made significant investments in our operations and infrastructure. Nearly all of our titles outperformed during the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
The NBA 2K series is known throughout the world for being the most authentic, the most realistic and the most engaging basketball simulation experience in our industry. In addition to giving consumers the ability to step onto the court of their favorite NBA players or themselves, 2K and Visual Concepts have created various game modes that offer interactive experiences and enable players to build deeper social connections. NBA 2K21 was our first offering built from the ground up for Gen 9 platforms. 
To date, the title has exceeded our expectations and sold in over 10 million units. During the fourth quarter, net bookings for the series grew 37% and recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations significantly, growing 32% and 73% in the period and fiscal year, respectively. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong with more than 2.3 million users playing the game daily. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. 
Once again, Rockstar Games iconic Grand Theft Auto series exceeded our expectations, expanded its audience and set new benchmarks in fiscal 2021. Driven by an array of new free content updates and sustained interest in last holidays, Cayo Perico Heise, Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from strong engagement trends during the fourth quarter, including a record number of active players and the second highest quarter of recurrent consumer spending on record. 
For the full year, participation levels reached an all-time high from both new and returning players and recurrent consumer spending grew 31%, achieving a new annual record. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also surpassed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold in more than 145 million units worldwide. Red Dead Online exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with active players increasing significantly in recurrent consumer spending performing above our plans, due in part to the success of the recently released stand-alone version of the game. 
Throughout the period, Rockstar Games released new content updates for Red Down Online, including brand-new missions for solar players, the Atlas Pass #5 and its new rewards and more. Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to perform very well and to date has sold in over 37 million units worldwide. During the fourth quarter, 2K announced our acquisition of HB Studios, the developers of our highly successful golf game PGA Tour 2K21, which to date has sold in more than 2 million units. We're very excited about the growth potential for the PGA Tour 2K series, especially as 2K has entered into an exclusive long-term agreement with golf lean and icon Tiger Woods to serve as its Executive Director and consultant, which we believe will enhance the series ongoing innovation and authenticity. 
During the period, 2K and games released the Vietnam and KubeCon, and Portugal packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that were the final offerings for the game's incredibly successful New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI's daily active users have grown steadily since the game is released more than 5 years ago. And to date, the title has sold in over 11 million units. As a result of the engagement from the past as well as the success of Excom Chimera Squad and XCOM 2 Switch, for Axis Games had 1 of its best years ever. We expect this growth to continue as the studio has several exciting projects in development that will be revealed this year. 
During the fourth quarter, Private Division released Murder on Eridanus, the final add-on for their highly successful game in the Auto world, which has sold in more than 3 million units. The add-on will also be coming to switch later this year. Private Division's 2019 release and the Humankind Odyssey has now sold in over 1 million units, marking the third title from the label to achieve the million unit milestone joining the Auto World and Kerbal Space Program. 
Providing new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles after their initial launch is a key strategic priority of our organization and represents an important long-term growth and margin opportunity. Our record levels of recurring consumer spending were largely driven by NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online during the fourth quarter and were enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games led by Dragon City Monster Legends exceeded our expectations. Strong seasonal content and features as well as increased marketing investments helped drive net bookings growth of nearly 30% for the period and 44% for the year. The studio is planning to release 3 new titles during the second half of fiscal 2022. 
Playdots had a strong fourth quarter driven by the outstanding performance of Two Dots, which achieved sequential growth over the third quarter. We expect Playdots to be a significant contributor to our results over the long term. And look forward to its new release plan for the fall. WWE SuperCard also outperformed, growing 24% during the fourth quarter and 28% during the year. The title has now been downloaded more than 23 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. 
NBA 2K online in China grew 6% and 9% during the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports in China with more than 52 million registered users. 
Turning to our outlook. We believe that the pandemic initiated a transformational shift in entertainment consumption, revealing the possibilities of interactive entertainment to a much broader market with interactive entertainment becoming the #1 entertainment vertical. We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. 
We currently expect our fiscal 2022 net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, marking the second year in a row with net bookings in excess of $3 billion. We expect to achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023. And over the next few years, we believe that we will establish new records of operating results even above the spectacular performance we delivered this past year. Lainie will share more details about our outlook. 
As Karl will discuss in greater detail in fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings including 4 immersive core releases from proven and new franchises. With the strongest pipeline in our company's history, including many new releases planned for fiscal 2023 and 2024. We're highly optimistic about our growth trajectory, and we'll be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT and other infrastructure. In closing, we remain confident in our proven strategy and talented teams around the world as we continue to grow our business, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

In addition, I want to thank our player communities for engaging with our experiences and making our games part of their lives. 
I'll now discuss our recent releases. On April 2, 2K and Visual Concepts once again expanded the breadth and depth of the NBA 2K franchise with the release of NBA 2K21 for Apple Arcade, our first offering for the platform. And NBA 2K21 is the most advanced basketball simulation game available on Apple devices, featuring an all-new graphics engine that offers the highest possible resolution, updated rosters and a variety of exciting game modes. NBA 2K '21 is currently the most popular game on ethyl arcade. 
On April 7, 2K and HB Studios released the TravisMathew and Puma Golf Gear update for PGA Tour 2K '21. which keeps players swinging with wag on the cutting edge of modern golf fashion. The TravisMathew Collection includes new polo shirts, hats and shoes, marking the brand's PGA Tour 2K21 debut, while Puma Golf introduces an all-new oversize hat and new footwear. On April 8, 2K and Gearbox Software continued to enhance the Borderlands franchise with the release of the Directors cut, the sixth add-on for Borderlands 3. 2K and Gearbox will release 2 additional vault cards that will become available for owners of the Directors cut before the end of calendar 2021, and all players can look forward to returning in-game events like Revenge of the Cartel. 
In addition, the teams are continuing to explore cross-play functionality that will enable fans to play Borderlands 3 with their friends across multiple platforms, and we expect to have more to share in the coming months. Anticipation is growing for Lionsgate's full-length live-action film based on Borderlands. The film was directed by Eli Roth and will feature some of Hollywood favorite stars, including Kate Blanchette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Edgar Ramirez. We believe that the film promises to capture the thrills and distinct personality of the series and has the potential to introduce new audiences to the beloved world of Borderlands. 
Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As Ralph mentioned, we have an exciting array of offerings planned for this year, and our long-term development pipeline represents the strongest in Take-Two's history. For fiscal 2022, we have 21 titles planned for release, including 4 immersive core releases for purchase, which include 2 releases from new franchises and 2 titles from existing franchises. 
One new independent title, Ali Ali World from Private Division, which will be available for purchase. 10 free-to-play mobile games, including 6 titles from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises. And 6 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. 
While we are very excited to once again be working with the NFL and NFL PA, our first title under these new partnerships is no longer expected to be released during fiscal year 2022. 2K will have more to share on their plans for our football offerings going forward. 
I'll now discuss details on our announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games has massive new updates coming this summer to both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online and will deliver fans most heavily requested additions in a host of new items, including quality of life updates. On May 25, Red Dead Online will deliver 8 new races, spanning iconic locations across the game's 5 states. including standard, open, target and open target races. Later this summer, fans can look forward to a host of new missions for skilled outlays involving everything from quick holdups to larger, high state robberies for big rewards. 
Grand Tieto Online continues to expand and evolve. On May 27, Rockstar Games will release 8 new stuck races, which will introduce an array of white [indiscernible] for racers in an assortment of vehicle classes. Fans of the futuristic deadline mode, will be happy to have 7 new arenas for combat coming soon. Survival mode will also expand to new locations throughout Los Anthos and Blaine County. And later this summer, car culture will return to Los Santos in new ways in Grand Theft Auto online's next major update, offering fans of performance and customization upgrades, new opportunities to get together and show off their rides. 
This includes a new social space for car meets alongside new races and race types, new vehicles to acquire and a series of new vehicle themed multipart robbery missions. Notably, these major summer updates will continue to deliver additional surprises in the weeks and months after launch including special benefits for players when the enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online arrived on Gen 9 consoles this November 11. 
Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. This year, we will have 2 sports releases from our popular franchises. 2K and Visual Concepts are once again aiming to raise the bar for excellence with NBA 2K20, the latest offering in our industry-leading basketball simulation series. In addition to making the Encore action even more authentic Vans can look forward to new and fun ways to engage with various game modes. Additionally, WWE 2K 22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. 
During the broadcast of Wrestle Mania 37, 2K and Visual Concepts revealed the very first teaser video for the game, featuring both live action and stunning in-game footage of WWE Superstar Ray Materion a high-flying Lucha Libre legend and one of the most exciting and decorated superstars in WWE history.

The Please note that additional details regarding our actu",1454,"Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. The Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our strong momentum continued into the fourth quarter, and we significantly exceeded our net bookings guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'd like to thank our talented colleagues around the world for their passion and dedication, which has been inspiring, especially given the challenges that COVID-19 has presented us with. 
Starting with our fourth quarter results. Total net bookings grew 8% to $785 million as compared to our outlook of $602 million to $652 million. These outstanding results marked our highest level of fourth quarter net bookings on record. During the period, recurrent consumer spending grew 17% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. 
Our outperformance was primarily due to the incredible performance of NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 8% and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook of a 10% decline due to the outperformance of both recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 74% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 10% to $839 million, while cost of goods sold decreased to $280 million, including a reversal of expense of $65 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. 
Operating expenses increased to 25% to $304 million, driven by higher marketing, research and development and IT expenses as well as the addition of Play Dots. And GAAP net income grew 78% to $219 million or $1.88 per share as compared to $123 million or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Turning to our fiscal 2021 results. Total net bookings grew 19% to a new record of $3.55 billion, This exceeded our initial guidance by approximately $1 billion. We experienced exceptional engagement during the shelter-in-place conditions and delivered extraordinary results across many of our franchises, including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption Border land, Social Point's mobile games and Sid Meier's Civilization. 
Recurrent consumer spending grew 48%, establishing a new record and accounted for 63% of total net bookings. This exceeded our prior outlook of 45% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 27% to a new record of approximately $3.1 billion and accounted for 87% of the total. This also exceeded our prior outlook of 20% growth due to better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. 
During fiscal 2021, 64% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 55% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $920 million as compared to our previous outlook of over $750 million and marked a record level for our company. During fiscal 2021, we spent $69 million on capital expenditures. 
At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance exceeded $2.7 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 9% to $3.37 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the addition of Play Dots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 46% to $589 million or $5.09 per share. 
Our GAAP net income benefited from a $40.6 million gain on the sale of a long-term investment and a reversal of expense of $70 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock award. He we gave our initial outlook for fiscal 2022. Rebookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, the second highest level of net bookings in our company's history. This is partly driven by the exciting pipeline of new releases that we have planned for the year with the majority of our titles coming in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect that engagement trends will be notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the return to normalcy continues, we expect the moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. 
We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and Playdots. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 15% as a result of the challenging comparisons from last year. Recurrent consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to be approximately 59% versus 63% last year due to more new releases this year. 
We project digitally delivered net bookings to decline by about 8% as a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $100 million for capital expenditures. 
The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year is primarily due to continued spending on studio and office build-outs and IT expense to support our investment in talent. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion. 
At the midpoint, this represents a 22% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have over 60 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we are making significant investments in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT to bring our pipeline to market. Additionally, we will have a full year of expenses for Playdots. While these investments will impact our operating results this year, we are confident that our growing pipeline will enable us to scale our business further and improve our margins in the next few years. 
And we expect GAAP net income to range from $228 million to $257 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $625 million to $675 million as compared to $996 million in the first quarter last year, which was the first full quarter of the COVID-related shelter in place condition when we experienced a strong initial surge in engagement. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K21, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 30% as we will start to compare against the record levels of engagement that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 30%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 71% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $730 million to $780 million and cost of goods sold to range from $277 million to $303 million. 
Operating expenses are expected to range from $36 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses and the inclusion of Playdots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $116 million to $129 million or $1 to $1.10 per share. 
In closing, fiscal 2021 was a record year for our business, and we believe that we can exceed these levels of financial results and establish new record levels of performance in the coming years. Our pipeline is robust, and we couldn't be more excited about our new releases for fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we continue to enhance our business by investing in talent, including growing our development headcount and building our infrastructure, we are positioning our company for long-term growth and success. and we expect to deliver sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

And then second, now that we have the release date for the expanded and enhanced version of GTA V and GTA Online, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether or not you'd expect this to usher in the next 7-year cycle for GT Online content updates and RCS growth?

There's an awful lot of interesting things going on in the world of user-generated content, and there have been for some time. And we're open-minded, and we want to support the community.

The rub is to find a way to engage consumers on the one hand and enable them to express their interest and even their creative desires in the context of our properties. And there are numerous ways to go about that. And I believe we will explore many of those ways, again, in the context of protecting our intellectual property. 
With regards to Grand Theft Auto, it may shock you to learn that I'm probably not going to comment much on content to come from Rockstar Games. We're so grateful for the extraordinary results that we've had with all Rockstar titles. And in fact, all titles coming from throughout the organization. Grand Theft Auto Online set another record past fiscal year. We sold in over 145 million units. We're very optimistic about what there is to come, including more content. And stay tuned because Rockstar Games will be talking more about that in the future."

But we do think it's a long-term franchise, and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results. 
In terms of Private Division, we really couldn't be more pleased with the way Private Division is going. As Strauss said, we've already had 3 titles that have sold in excess of 1 million units each. which is unusual for independent releases. We have a lot of titles in process. We've got one coming up this year with Ali Ali World. There are a lot of other deals in the pipeline. We've talked about some of them, most of them we have not talked about yet, And they're varied. There are different scales, different sizes, different shapes, different kinds of experiences, which make makes them very exciting.

In terms of how we're doing despite the pandemic, look, the team has just performed so well. We were very fortunate. Our IT group had us fully prepared for a disaster, and we could never predict the pandemic, but a week after We had to start working from home. We were all set up remotely, and we were highly productive, and we stayed highly productive ever since We had virtually no slippage. The only title that actually moved as a result of the pandemic was Kerbal Space Program 2, which moved out of this fiscal year, and we're super excited about that title and it will be coming. The rest of our production stayed on target and the quality has been amazing as you've seen in our results. We are highly confident in our pipeline going forward. As Karl said, though, the price that we pay for being as transparent about our future pipeline is that certain things will change. We hope that certain things will change to the good certain things may also disappoint us. At this point in time, we feel very good about the way our production is unfolding and we don't see any concerns on the horizon. 
With regard to M&A, our strategy remains the same. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to to do everything from modest add-on acquisitions. For example, we acquired HP Studios to more substantial acquisitions such as the acquisition of Playdots last calendar year. And prior to that, the acquisition of Social Point. There's no secret in that we wish to bulk up our mobile offerings. We're certainly trying to do that organically. We have many titles coming from mobile from Social Point and Playdots and 2K. And at the same time, we're open-minded with regard to acquisitions. Our lens is pretty disciplined. And the result of that discipline lines is that in 14 years, we haven't had 1 failed acquisition. I'm sure we've also missed some opportunities by being overly disciplined. But on balance, it's worked out well for us. Our capital is used for 3 purposes: returning capital to our shareholders, which we've aggressively done over many years, although opportunistically, supporting organic growth, which is our story around here, and allowing us to pursue inorganic growth opportunities on a selective and disciplined basis. And I think that will continue to be the case. Finally, with regard to console shortages, there's no doubt that supply chains were disrupted in the pandemic. They still remain disruptive. There is a chip shortage. But it's sort of a good news, bad news thing. The bad news, I suppose, is that you can't get a console for lower money. The good news is that people really want these new consoles. We had a limited selection of releases for NextGen NBA 2K21, which is built from the ground up for NextGen and Borderlands III. We have obviously many more titles coming in the future. We think the supply shortages will be resolved and consumers would be able to buy their dream console. So over time, we're not worried about it, and it didn't really hurt us short term either."

So it's a very different marketing than it was in the past where we would just market on release. Now the titles are being marketed all throughout their life cycle. So you'll probably see higher marketing going forward."

Our strong fourth quarter performance concluded an exceptional year for our organization. We delivered net bookings of approximately $3.6 billion, which grew nearly 20% from fiscal 2020 and were the highest ever in our company's history. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results despite such significant unforeseen and prolonged challenges. It's truly a reflection of our collective resilience and singular commitment to excellence. Our thoughts are with those who have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19. We hope that better days and comfort will come to you soon. 
Throughout the pandemic, our creative teams have delivered consistently superlative entertainment experiences, giving players opportunities to have fun in the most difficult of times and stay connected with family and friends through shared experiences. We grew our online communities meaningfully, including new and returning players, which helped drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 48% to reach a record high and represents 63% of our total net bookings for fiscal 2021. 
During the year, we enhanced our organization for the long term. We bolstered the depth of our creative teams by hiring more than 700 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and grow our business. We also broadened our portfolio of offerings, capitalized on diverse business models and made significant investments in our operations and infrastructure. Nearly all of our titles outperformed during the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
The NBA 2K series is known throughout the world for being the most authentic, the most realistic and the most engaging basketball simulation experience in our industry. In addition to giving consumers the ability to step onto the court of their favorite NBA players or as themselves, 2K and Visual Concepts have created various game modes that offer interactive experiences and enable players to build deeper social connections. NBA 2K21 was our first offering built from the ground up for Gen 9 platforms. 
To date, the title has exceeded our expectations and sold in over 10 million units. During the fourth quarter, net bookings for the series grew 37% and recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations significantly, growing 32% and 73% in the period and fiscal year, respectively. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong with more than 2.3 million users playing the game daily. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. 
Once again, Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto series exceeded our expectations, expanded its audience and set new benchmarks in fiscal 2021. Driven by an array of new free content updates and sustained interest in last holidays, Cayo Perico Heist, Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from strong engagement trends during the fourth quarter, including a record number of active players and the second highest quarter of recurrent consumer spending on record. 
For the full year, participation levels reached an all-time high from both new and returning players and recurrent consumer spending grew 31%, achieving a new annual record. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also surpassed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold in more than 145 million units worldwide. Red Dead Online exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with active players increasing significantly in recurrent consumer spending performing above our plans, due in part to the success of the recently released stand-alone version of the game. 
Throughout the period, Rockstar Games released new content updates for Red Dead Online, including brand-new missions for solo players, the Outlaw Pass #5 and its new rewards and more. Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to perform very well and to date has sold in over 37 million units worldwide. During the fourth quarter, 2K announced our acquisition of HB Studios, the developers of our highly successful golf game PGA Tour 2K21, which to date has sold in more than 2 million units. We're very excited about the growth potential for the PGA Tour 2K series, especially as 2K has entered into an exclusive long-term agreement with golf legend and icon Tiger Woods to serve as its Executive Director and consultant, which we believe will enhance the series' ongoing innovation and authenticity. 
During the period, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam and Kublai Khan, and Portugal packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that were the final offerings for the game's incredibly successful New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI's daily active users have grown steadily since the game's release more than 5 years ago. And to date, the title has sold in over 11 million units. As a result of the engagement from the past as well as the success of XCOM: Chimera Squad and XCOM 2 on Switch, Firaxis Games had one of its best years ever. We expect this growth to continue as the studio has several exciting projects in development that will be revealed this year. 
During the fourth quarter, Private Division released Murder on Eridanos, the final add-on for their highly successful game in The Outer Worlds, which has sold in more than 3 million units. The add-on will also be coming to switch later this year. Private Division's 2019 release, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey has now sold in over 1 million units, marking the third title from the label to achieve the million unit milestone joining The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program. 
Providing new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles after their initial launch is a key strategic priority of our organization and represents an important long-term growth and margin opportunity. Our record levels of recurring consumer spending were largely driven by NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online during the fourth quarter and were enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games led by Dragon City and Monster Legends exceeded our expectations. Strong seasonal content and features as well as increased marketing investments helped drive net bookings growth of nearly 30% for the period and 44% for the year. The studio is planning to release 3 new titles during the second half of fiscal 2022. 
PlayDots had a strong fourth quarter driven by the outstanding performance of Two Dots, which achieved sequential growth over the third quarter. We expect PlayDots to be a significant contributor to our results over the long term. And look forward to its new release plan for the fall. WWE SuperCard also outperformed, growing 24% during the fourth quarter and 28% during the year. The title has now been downloaded more than 23 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. 
NBA 2K Online in China grew 6% and 9% during the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 52 million registered users. 
Turning to our outlook. We believe that the pandemic initiated a transformational shift in entertainment consumption, revealing the possibilities of interactive entertainment to a much broader market with interactive entertainment becoming the #1 entertainment vertical. We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. 
We currently expect our fiscal 2022 net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, marking the second year in a row with net bookings in excess of $3 billion. We expect to achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023. And over the next few years, we believe that we will establish new records of operating results even above the spectacular performance we delivered this past year. Lainie will share more details about our outlook. 
As Karl will discuss in greater detail, in fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings including 4 immersive core releases from proven and new franchises. With the strongest pipeline in our company's history, including many new releases planned for fiscal 2023 and 2024, we're highly optimistic about our growth trajectory, and we'll be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT and other infrastructure. In closing, we remain confident in our proven strategy and talented teams around the world. As we continue to grow our business, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering a record year.

Our colleagues' commitment, professionalism and talent are among the best in the industry, and I could not be prouder of what we've achieved together. In addition, I want to thank our player communities for engaging with our experiences and making our games part of their lives. 
I'll now discuss our recent releases. On April 2, 2K and Visual Concepts once again expanded the breadth and depth of the NBA 2K franchise with the release of NBA 2K21 for Apple Arcade, our first offering for the platform. NBA 2K21 is the most advanced basketball simulation game available on Apple devices, featuring an all-new graphics engine that offers the highest possible resolution, updated rosters and a variety of exciting game modes. NBA 2K21 is currently the most popular game on Apple Arcade. 
On April 7, 2K and HB Studios released the TravisMathew and Puma Golf Gear update for PGA Tour 2K21, which keeps players swinging with swag on the cutting edge of modern golf fashion. The TravisMathew Collection includes new polo shirts, hats and shoes, marking the brand's PGA Tour 2K21 debut, while Puma Golf introduces an all-new oversized hat and new footwear. On April 8, 2K and Gearbox Software continued to enhance the Borderlands franchise with the release of the Directors cut, the sixth add-on for Borderlands 3. 2K and Gearbox will release 2 additional vault cards that will become available for owners of the Directors cut before the end of calendar 2021, and all players can look forward to returning in-game events like Revenge of the Cartels. 
In addition, the teams are continuing to explore cross-play functionality that will enable fans to play Borderlands 3 with their friends across multiple platforms, and we expect to have more to share in the coming months. Anticipation is growing for Lionsgate's full-length live-action film based on Borderlands. The film is directed by Eli Roth and will feature some of Hollywood favorite stars, including Cate Blanchette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Edgar Ramirez. We believe that the film promises to capture the thrills and distinct personality of the series has the potential to introduce new audiences to the beloved world of Borderlands. 
Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As Strauss mentioned, we have an exciting array of offerings planned for this year, and our long-term development pipeline represents the strongest in Take-Two's history. For fiscal 2022, we have 21 titles planned for release, including 4 immersive core releases for purchase, which include 2 releases from new franchises and 2 titles from existing franchises. 
One new independent title, OlliOlli World from Private Division, which will be available for purchase. 10 free-to-play mobile games, including 6 titles from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises. And 6 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. 
While we are very excited to once again be working with the NFL and NFLPA, our first title under these new partnerships is no longer expected to be released during fiscal year 2022. 2K will have more to share on their plans for our football offerings going forward. 
I'll now discuss details on our announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games has massive new updates coming this summer to both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online and will deliver fans' most heavily requested additions in a host of new items, including quality of life updates. On May 25, Red Dead Online will deliver 8 new races, spanning iconic locations across the game's 5 states. including standard, open, target and open target races. Later this summer, fans can look forward to a host of new missions for skilled outlaws involving everything from quick holdups to larger, high state robberies for big rewards. 
Grand Theft Auto Online continues to expand and evolve. On May 27, Rockstar Games will release 8 new stunt races, which will introduce an array of white-knuckled for racers in an assortment of vehicle classes. Fans of the futuristic Deadline Mode will be happy to have 7 new arenas for combat coming soon. Survival mode will also expand to new locations throughout Los Santos and Blaine County. And later this summer, car culture will return to Los Santos in new ways in Grand Theft Auto Online's next major update, offering fans of performance and customization upgrades, new opportunities to get together and show off their rides. 
This includes a new social space for car meets alongside new races and race types, new vehicles to acquire and a series of new vehicle themed multipart robbery missions. Notably, these major summer updates will continue to deliver additional surprises in the weeks and months after launch including special benefits for players when the enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online arrive on Gen 9 consoles this November 11. 
Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. This year, we will have 2 sports releases from our popular franchises. 2K and Visual Concepts are once again aiming to raise the bar for excellence with NBA 2K22, the latest offering in our industry-leading basketball simulation series. In addition to making the On-court action even more authentic fans can look forward to new and fun ways to engage with various game modes. Additionally, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. 
During the broadcast of Wrestle Mania 37, 2K and Visual Concepts revealed the very first teaser video for the game, featuring both live action and stunning in-game footage of WWE Superstar Ray Mysterio a high-flying Lucha Libre legend and one of the most exciting and decorated superstars in WWE history. The teaser also highlighted WWE 2K22's tagline, it hits different. which is reflective of both the new direction of the game and its supporting marketing campaign. We're very excited about the team's fresh approach to the series. And last week, our WWE 2K22 development team at Visual Concepts kicked off a social media campaign presently behind the scenes, sneak peaks of the game and developer diary videos. 2K will continue to unveil details in the coming months. 
2K will also introduce 2 releases from new franchises this year, including 1 from Gearbox. On June 24, Private Division will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Kerbal Space Program. Private Division intends to mark the occasion with a week-long celebration, including free content updates and more.

OlliOlli World marks a bold new direction for this critically acclaimed skateboarding franchise and is bursting with personality. Players slip and flow through Radlandia, a vibrant world of full color characters as they search for the mystical Skate God on their quest for Nirvana. 
Radlandia and its dwellers are charming, weird and crafted with a unique art style. Players can enjoy the game's deep combo system and everything it has to offer while pros can really prove their skills and master a vast number of moves with access to millions of unique levels in the game's sandbox mode. 
In addition, players can also compete against similarly skilled rivals around the globe in player leagues. Fiscal 2022 will be a big year for mobile with 10 new free-to-play offerings, including new titles from 2K, Social Point and PlayDots. We'll also have 6 iterations of previous release titles, including enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and the stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online for Gen 9 consoles available for free 3 months for PlayStation 5 players. Both of which will launch in the second half of this calendar year. 
Looking ahead, we expect to deliver over 40 titles across fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, which gives us confidence in our ability to reach new record levels of operating results in the next few years.

It bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. 
It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion or some may be delayed, and we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In the coming months, you'll start to see our titles come to market and we'll aim to share similar updates going forward when we provide our year-end results. In addition to our title releases, we'll also continue to have significant long-term opportunity to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. 
Our focus on enhancing our data analytics is enabling us to deepen our understanding of our player base and how they prefer to interact with our games, which is helping us to develop the most desirable products, expansions and new content updates. 
Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League will kick off its fourth season on May 19 and continue for 16 weeks.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual r",1453,"Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our strong momentum continued into the fourth quarter, and we significantly exceeded our net bookings guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'd like to thank our talented colleagues around the world for their passion and dedication, which has been inspiring, especially given the challenges that COVID-19 has presented us with. 
Starting with our fourth quarter results. Total net bookings grew 8% to $785 million as compared to our outlook of $602 million to $652 million. These outstanding results marked our highest level of fourth quarter net bookings on record. During the period, recurrent consumer spending grew 17% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. 
Our outperformance was primarily due to the incredible performance of NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 8% and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook of a 10% decline due to the outperformance of both recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 74% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 10% to $839 million, while cost of goods sold decreased to $280 million, including a reversal of expense of $65 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. 
Operating expenses increased to 25% to $304 million, driven by higher marketing, research and development and IT expenses as well as the addition of PlayDots. And GAAP net income grew 78% to $219 million or $1.88 per share as compared to $123 million or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Turning to our fiscal 2021 results. Total net bookings grew 19% to a new record of $3.55 billion. This exceeded our initial guidance by approximately $1 billion. We experienced exceptional engagement during the shelter-in-place conditions and delivered extraordinary results across many of our franchises, including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, Social Point's mobile games and Sid Meier's Civilization. 
Recurrent consumer spending grew 48%, establishing a new record and accounted for 63% of total net bookings. This exceeded our prior outlook of 45% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 27% to a new record of approximately $3.1 billion and accounted for 87% of the total. This also exceeded our prior outlook of 20% growth due to better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. 
During fiscal 2021, 64% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from the 55% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $920 million as compared to our previous outlook of over $750 million and marked a record level for our company. During fiscal 2021, we spent $69 million on capital expenditures. 
At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance exceeded $2.7 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 9% to $3.37 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the addition of PlayDots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 46% to $589 million or $5.09 per share. 
Our GAAP net income benefited from a $40.6 million gain on the sale of a long-term investment and a reversal of expense of $70 million related to forfeitures of a previously granted stock award. 
Here we gave our initial outlook for fiscal 2022. We expect net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, the second highest level of net bookings in our company's history. This is partly driven by the exciting pipeline of new releases that we have planned for the year with the majority of our titles coming in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect that engagement trends will be notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the return to normalcy continues, we expect the moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. 
We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and PlayDots. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 15% as a result of the challenging comparisons from last year. Recurrent consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to be approximately 59% versus 63% last year due to more new releases this year. 
We project digitally delivered net bookings to decline by about 8% as a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $100 million for capital expenditures. 
The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year is primarily due to continued spending on studio and office build-outs and IT expense to support our investment in talent. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion. 
At the midpoint, this represents a 22% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have over 60 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we are making significant investments in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT to bring our pipeline to market. Additionally, we will have a full year of expenses for PlayDots. While these investments will impact our operating results this year, we are confident that our growing pipeline will enable us to scale our business further and improve our margins in the next few years. 
And we expect GAAP net income to range from $228 million to $257 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $625 million to $675 million as compared to $996 million in the first quarter last year, which was the first full quarter of the COVID-related shelter-in-place conditions when we experienced a strong initial surge in engagement. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K21, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 30% as we will start to compare against the record levels of engagement that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 30%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 71% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $730 million to $780 million and cost of goods sold to range from $277 million to $303 million. 
Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses and the inclusion of PlayDots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $116 million to $129 million or $1 to $1.10 per share. 
In closing, fiscal 2021 was a record year for our business, and we believe that we can exceed these levels of financial results and establish new record levels of performance in the coming years. Our pipeline is robust, and we couldn't be more excited about our new releases for fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we continue to enhance our business by investing in talent, including growing our development headcount and building our infrastructure, we are positioning our company for long-term growth and success. and we expect to deliver sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders.

There's an awful lot of interesting things going on in the world of user-generated content, and there have been for some time. And we're open-minded, and we want to support the community. At the same time, it's terribly important that we and others protect our intellectual property. So that's the rub. The rub is to find a way to engage consumers on the one hand and enable them to express their interest and even their creative desires in the context of our properties. And there are numerous ways to go about that. And I believe we will explore many of those ways, again, in the context of protecting our intellectual property. 
With regards to Grand Theft Auto, it may shock you to learn that I'm probably not going to comment much on content to come from Rockstar Games. We're so grateful for the extraordinary results that we've had with all Rockstar titles. And in fact, all titles coming from throughout the organization. Grand Theft Auto Online set another record past fiscal year. We sold in over 145 million units. We're very optimistic about what there is to come, including more content. And stay tuned because Rockstar Games will be talking more about that in the future."

The downloadable content has been really very well received, and we think the franchise is in outstanding shape at this point. And we will be participating in the franchise and whatever the future holds for that franchise. So we feel really good about it. And we think that it's still building audience and this game itself has a lot of life left in it. And the future -- we'll see what the future holds for it. But we do think it's a long-term franchise, and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results. 
In terms of Private Division, we really couldn't be more pleased with the way Private Division is going. As Strauss said, we've already had 3 titles that have sold in excess of 1 million units each, which is unusual for independent releases. We have a lot of titles in process. We've got one coming up this year with OlliOlli World. There are a lot of other deals in the pipeline. We've talked about some of them, most of them we have not talked about yet, and they're varied. There are different scales, different sizes, different shapes, different kinds of experiences, which make makes them very exciting. That team is growing, not only from a creative talent perspective in support of Kerbal Space Program, but also from a marketing and publishing perspective. So we expect the best is yet to come from Private Division, and we love how we're positioned right now."

In terms of how we're doing despite the pandemic, look, the team has just performed so well. We were very fortunate. Our IT group had us fully prepared for a disaster, and we could never predict the pandemic, but a week after we had to start working from home, we were all set up remotely, and we were highly productive, and we stayed highly productive ever since. 
We had virtually no slippage. The only title that actually moved as a result of the pandemic was Kerbal Space Program 2, which moved out of this fiscal year, and we're super excited about that title and it will be coming. The rest of our production stayed on target and the quality has been amazing as you've seen in our results. We are highly confident in our pipeline going forward. As Karl said, though, the price that we pay for being as transparent about our future pipeline is that certain things will change. We hope that certain things will change to the good, certain things may also disappoint us. At this point in time, we feel very good about the way our production is unfolding and we don't see any concerns on the horizon. 
With regard to M&A, our strategy remains the same. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to do everything from modest add-on acquisitions. For example, we acquired HB Studios. 2 more substantial acquisitions such as the acquisition of PlayDots last calendar year. And prior to that, the acquisition of Social Point. There's no secret in that we wish to bulk up our mobile offerings. We're certainly trying to do that organically. We have many titles coming from mobile from Social Point and PlayDots and 2K. And at the same time, we're open-minded with regard to acquisitions. 
Our lens is pretty disciplined. And the result of that disciplined lens is that in 14 years, we haven't had 1 failed acquisition. I'm sure we've also missed some opportunities by being overly disciplined. But on balance, it's worked out well for us. Our capital is used for 3 purposes: returning capital to our shareholders, which we've aggressively done over many years, although opportunistically, supporting organic growth, which is our story around here, and allowing us to pursue inorganic growth opportunities on a selective and disciplined basis. And I think that will continue to be the case. 
Finally, with regard to console shortages, there's no doubt that supply chains were disrupted in the pandemic. They still remain disruptive. There is a chip shortage. But it's sort of a good news, bad news thing. The bad news, I suppose, is that you can't get a console for lower money. The good news is that people really want these new consoles. We had a limited selection of releases for Next Gen NBA 2K21, which is built from the ground up for Next Gen and Borderlands III. We have obviously many more titles coming in the future. We think the supply shortages will be resolved and consumers would be able to buy their dream console. So over time, we're not worried about it, and it didn't really hurt us short term either."

I'm always allergic to buzzwords. The buzzword of virtual reality didn't get this industry very far. AR hasn't really improved matters either, 3D hasn't really done much for us. What moves the dial in our business is amazing creativity great characters, great stories, great graphics, great gameplay, the ability to enjoy those experiences with other people all around the world. That's what really matters. 
I think what the metaverse implies is what we already do with Grand Theft Auto Online and with what Red Dead Online, what we do with NBA 2K and what we aim to do with some upcoming titles, an opportunity to exist in that fictional world and express yourself in ways that are challenging, fun, competitive and new and find ourselves in places doing things that we can't really do usually in the real world. I think that's what it means. 
I think when you get into conversations around -- are people going to do conference calls in titles? Well, the answer is they can now. But who -- were not do, like we could, I guess, do this conference call inside 1 of our titles, but it's a bit more efficient to do it this way. So the problem I have is that if you sort of take metaverse, SPAC and cryptocurrency, put them all together. In 5 years, will any of this matter? I'm not sure it will."

And we have different ways for people to engage and therefore, we have different ways for it to monetize in those modes.
And just getting people to play, people more deeply engage in the game and play across those modes, there's a lot of opportunity right there in and of itself. So we're not just stuck to 1 type of monetization for card packs, et cetera, like that. We've got a lot of other opportunities.

And the goal of this organization has always been and remains, be where the consumer is, which means we'll employ a broad array of distribution platforms, including our own direct-to-consumer platform. And what that means over time is it's going to be hard to have a take rate for distributors that is economically too high. That leads to an unstable system. And that's what you're seeing now, in my opinion.

I'm pleased to report that fiscal year 2022 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $711 million, which exceeded our expectations. As the world has moved towards a safer, new normal, we experienced strong engagement trends across most of our core franchises. 
During the period, we took multiple steps to enhance our organization over the long term. We invested further in talent and core infrastructure, which are important areas to support our expansive multiyear pipeline. Mobile remains a key growth opportunity, and we believe that our acquisition of Nordeus will enhance meaningfully our talents and expertise in this area. 
With a larger mobile footprint, we've integrated Social Point, PlayDots and Nordeus since T2 mobile games. This structure will enable us to realize cost synergies, leverage expertise and share best practices across our teams. 
I'm also proud that we deepened our focus on corporate responsibility, and we've recently made several key hires to lead our efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Turning to our first quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Borderlands 3. For nearly 8 years, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have redefined the creative and cultural influence of interactive entertainment, setting new standards for multiple generations of consumers and gaming platforms. 
Sales of Grand Theft Auto V were significantly above our expectations once again, and the title has now sold in more than 150 million units. 
Rockstar Games continue to keep its massive player base engaged with new content updates for Grand Theft Online, including 8 new stock races, 7 new arenas for deadline mode and regular in-game bonuses and incentives. This helped drive the title to its second highest first quarter on record for player audience in its third consecutive quarter of player growth. 
In comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved a 72% increase in its audience size, a 77% increase in new players and significant growth in recurring consumer spending. In addition, Rockstar Games continue to captivate and engage audiences with Red Dead Redemption 2, which exceeded our expectations and has now sold in more than 38 million units. Red Dead Online also enjoyed a strong quarter, thanks to new content offerings, including 8 new horse races and a creative array of bonuses and incentives. The game experienced strong performance as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, including 18% growth in its audience size, 26% growth in new players and outstanding growth in recurrent consumer spending. This performance was driven by both strong ongoing game sales and the continued influx of new players from the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online. 
Turning to our sports offerings, NBA 2K21 has sold in over 11 million units and remains the #1 sports title in the U.S. NBA 2K's community continues to be highly engaged with more than 2.7 million users playing daily. As compared to last year, the game experienced 13% growth in first-time spenders and nearly 30% growth in returning players. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. 
PGA Tour 2K21 continues to exceed our expectations and expand its audience. In June, 2K and HB Studios launched a community driven program that allows the top golf course designers from around the world to create and submit ideas for inclusion in the game's online playlist. This program is enhancing the game's vast replayability while also driving player engagement and growing its global community. 
Borderlands 3 had a strong quarter. During the period, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Director's Cut add-on providing new missions, characters, daily and weekly challenges and unique rewards. The game was also supported with an array of new free content offerings that gave players more ways to perfect and expand their arsenals. 2K interactive games launched Sid Meier's Civilization VI Anthology on Windows PC, providing the ultimate package for players that have yet to experience the award-winning critically-acclaimed strategy title. The anthology includes the base game, all previously released DLC, the rise and fall and gathering storm expansions as well as the popular New Frontier Pass. Civilization 6 has sold in more than 11 million units, outperforming its predecessor at the same point in its life cycle. Later this year, 2K and Firaxis Games will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the civilization franchise, and I'd like to congratulate our teams on this incredible milestone. 
Kerbal Space Program, which has sold in over 5 million units, celebrated its 10-year anniversary in June. To mark the milestone, Private Division released a short documentary video detailing the achievements of the title as well as its impact on the aerospace industry. One of our key strategic priorities is to provide new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles and the communities built around them after their initial launch. During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 25%, which was better than our expectations of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. 
Overall, all evidence suggests that media consumption patterns are beginning to stabilize to a new normal. And while down from the highs of the previous year, recurrent consumer spending in our products has leveled off and remained significantly higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending in the period were NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. We also experienced strong performance across many of our free-to-play offerings. 
Monster Legends and Dragon City exceeded our expectations with sequential top line growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This performance was driven by strong live ops, successful feature releases and significant marketing investments. celebrated its seventh anniversary in June. The title performed well with positive momentum continuing from the second half of fiscal 2021. 
WWE Supercard has now been downloaded over 24 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. The franchise has had strong performance, with the last 12 months marking its sixth consecutive year of growth. 
Following our acquisition of Nordeus, we're encouraged by the performance of potential for top 11, including its use of seasonal live ops and new features. NBA 2K online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region, with nearly 54 million of registered users. 
Turning to our outlook. We're reiterating our prior guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2022. As we continue to develop our pipeline, there's been movement in some of our planned releases, including 2 of our more sub-core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. 
Our approach has always been to allow our labels to determine when projects are ready to bring to market to ensure the best quality and overall experience for players. As Karl will discuss in greater detail, we're excited about our pipeline and the impact of our new releases will have on our business and financial profile in the years to come. We believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023 and establish new record levels of operating results over the next few years. 
Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment sector and our competitive positioning. As we leverage our many advantages, our leading talent, focus on creativity, incredible portfolio of owned IP and strong balance sheet, we believe that Take-Two is well positioned to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'll now discuss our recent releases. Rockstar Games continued to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. In June, Rockstar released 7 new arenas for the fan favorite deadline mode to Grand Theft Auto Online. This was followed by the Los Santos Tuners update, the game's major summer launch in July, which delivered an action-packed street racing-themed update into Grand Theft Auto Online. The update introduced elements of the tuner car culture to the game world, including the, a new heavily requested shared social space for players to get together to modify their personal vehicles, watch others modify their 200 vehicles in real time, rates and test various vehicles on an underground test track and much more. 
In addition, the Los Santos Tuners Update features 6 epic new robbery contracts, 6 new race types, 10 new highly customizable vehicles, collectible USB sticks offering a new way to hear music from Moody Men and Seth Troxler and a host of quality of life updates, including a new customizable radio station wheel. 
The launch of the Los Santos Tuners set new records for Grand Theft Auto Online, including the largest number of players and the highest level of net bookings for both day 1 and during the opening week for any update in Grand Theft Auto Online's history. Looking ahead, the upcoming launch of the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto Online for PlayStation 5 and X Series X|S systems this November will allow for higher top speeds for select vehicles across these more powerful systems. 
In July, Rockstar Games released the bloody money update for Red Dead Online.

Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start, with our first quarter operating results exceeding our expectations. Net bookings were $711 million, which was above our guidance of $625 million to $675 million and marked our second highest Q1 on record. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. 
During the period, overall engagement exceeded our expectations. Recurrent consumer spending declined 25% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Online as well as the addition of Nordeus. This delivered net bookings declined 26% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 96% of the total. This result is better than our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. 
During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 71% last year. GAAP net revenue declined 2% to $813 million, while cost of goods sold decreased 31% to $330 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% to $313 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses as well as the addition of PlayDots and Nordeus. GAAP net income was $152 million or $1.30 per share as compared to $89 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. 
Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectation. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. While our first quarter results outperformed our expectations and our acquisition of Nordeus will benefit the year, this has been being offset by some changes to our release schedule, including moving 2 of our immersive core titles to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance has contemplated. 
We continue to be very excited about our pipeline and the next phase of growth that it presents for our company. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and Q2 mobile games. 
We forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. As a result of our outperformance in Q1 as well as the addition of Nordeus, we now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 9%, compared to our prior outlook of a 15% decline for this fiscal 2021. 
As a percentage of net working, recurrent consumer spending is expected to be relatively flat versus last year and represent 65% of total net bookings. We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 6% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. 
Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. 
We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million to capital expenditures. The increase over our prior guidance relates to the acquisition of 2 office buildings in the U.K. to support our business in the region. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.4 billion to $1.44 billion. Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing at the midpoint, a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects significant investments in marketing, personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year PlayDots. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $229 million to $259 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. 
For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. 
Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $815 million to $865 million compared to $958 million in the second quarter last year. Our guidance reflects the continued challenging comparisons from last year due to COVID-19. The largest contributors to net openings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Dragon City, Top 11 and. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 11% and digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 64% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $740 million to $790 million and cost of goods sold to range from $323 million to $349 million. 
Operating expenses are expected to range from $368 million to $378 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 27% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing, personnel, IT and research and development costs as well as the inclusion of PlayDots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $41 million to $53 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
In closing, our first quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and the incredible execution from our talented colleagues across the world. As we capitalize on our industry's strong talent, combined with our unique business drivers, we believe that our company will deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders.

Diversity is key to our success. We need to have a diverse perspective and diverse voices in order to create that quality. So it starts at the top. Our Board of Directors is diverse with respect to gender, race and skill set. Our management team is exceedingly diverse from a gender perspective. And our voice as a result are diverse. 
But we're not stopping there. We're also reaching into the community to create a broader, more diverse pool from which we can recruit and our competitors can recruit going forward. So we work together in company-sponsored service projects and the communities in which we operate. We encourage individual volunteerism and giving through philanthropic and matching donation programs. We support organizations that are focused on enhancing diversity. We increased the -- in Canada pool through scholarships to design students, contributions to organizations providing STEM opportunities to children and underserved communities. And delivering interview training and career counseling to young adults. And this crosses genders. But in many instances, we're also focused on young females as well.

So we've got -- we've mentioned what we have as we always do. In terms of how things are trending, post pandemic -- if you call this post pandemic, and I hope we can, it remains to be seen. The trend is almost exactly what we anticipated and what we've talked about now for over a year, which is we expected post-pandemic demand to be higher than pre-pandemic demand and lower than the demand during the pandemic, which stands to reason because people have, in many ways, return to normal in most of the world. That remains to be seen. 
And as to what will come in the future, I'm hopeful that, that will continue. But clearly, there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. It's now the #1 entertainment vertical. It's something like $180 billion market. It's a diverse market in terms of gender. It's a diverse market in terms of age. So we couldn't be more optimistic about the market than we are. 
And in terms of IDFA, it's still early days. It remains to be seen. We have not seen any negative impact on our business. And I think that's really because we're big enough that we have lots of access to data. We have a consolidated consumer database across all of our labels, which is very robust. And if you have enough of your own data and you have solid data analytics teams, which we have both at the corporate level and at the label level, then a great deal of the information can be found in other ways. And you can do appropriate marketing that protects consumer's privacy without the resources that we had before from Apple.

And in terms of the return on marketing spend, I wouldn't say there's better or worse. I would say that we're a little bit more targeted on how we're spending our marketing. So I'd say we were getting a better return because we're able to really see how we're spending the marketing in a better way with better analytics over the last few years.

We set those expectations when people come on board here through our code of conduct and our anti-harassment and antidiscrimination policies, all of which our colleagues are required to review and sign when they're hired. All of our colleagues take anti-harassment training at hire, and biannually after that. And we make it clear through the training and through our policy that if anyone does experience any inappropriate contact, there are multiple avenues to report that, and they'll never be retaliated against for doing so. 
Those options include the management chain, anyone in HR, an anonymous complaint by phone or online through our third-party hotline and website reporting too. Take-Two has a director of diversity and inclusion and that includes developing, executing and leading the global DE&I strategy, and that supports our business objectives. We also have multiple employee resource groups inside the company and we have more growing all the time, which gives us all a thrill. So that's what we're up to, very specifically. 
Again, is there more that we could do? I'm certain there is. Do we feel like we're in a pretty good place? We're grateful that we do feel that way right now. In terms of retention, our turnover rate is roughly half of the industries. That's been true for about the past 18 months. There have been times when it's been about 70% of industry levels, it's been trending down at a time when I think, in general, turnover is trending up. So we feel good about that. And that's another measure of how we're doing, so we focus on it."

I think what's changed is that in between big releases, we continue to engage consumers with add-on content and with opportunities to engage in online versions of the game in certain instances multiplayer opportunities as well. So that's what created recurrent consumer spending. But much more importantly, recurrent consumer spending reflects consumer activity and engagement.

Obviously, we don't have the same kind of win in our backs as we did during the pandemic itself, but now that the pandemic is hopefully over, some people are getting back to normal. We're experiencing what we expected, but we're also seeing instances like, for example, when the new movies came out for GTA Online, we're seeing record engagement. So that in itself shows you that the sort of the moderation that we've seen is really coming to an end because people are engaging when the content is released, and they're engaging in a very significant way. 
So that gives us a lot of confidence that we may be past the, I guess, you call them headwinds of losing the tailwinds of the pandemic, and we moved on to where the titles are behaving as we would expect in a more normalized environment. So we can see it in the numbers themselves. 
In terms of centralizing the studios and mobile under 1 umbrella, we do expect that there will be synergies across the organizations. Each of these studios has got something to bring in terms of expertise, whether it's data analytics, whether it's different ways to create content. There are a lot of things that they can learn from each other and bring them together under 1 management umbrella really gives us the ability -- not to mention also consumer data, really gives us the ability to pursue best practices across the entire organization. So yes, we do expect there to be synergies based on this reorganization."

The answer will be yes with regard to both mobile and console. The resources required are significant. The risk profile is significant. And the history of the entertainment business is that, over time, those that are very creative, become very successful. Those that are very successful become bigger. Those that are bigger, have the opportunity to acquire smaller enterprises.

We think that a subscription model can make sense for deep catalog titles, but it doesn't really make sense for frontline titles. And for any business model that makes sense in the entertainment business, it has to work for the creators of the entertainment as well as the consumers of the entertainment. And I think catalog can make sense for the publishers. It could make sense for consumers who are avid who really want access to a lot of product. 
But if you're getting into front-line product, then the economics are much more difficult to make sense of. And remember, consumers who are involved with interactive entertainment have different consumption patterns than those involved with linear entertainment. Linear entertainment consumers consume something like 150 hours of programming a month. That's probably well over 100 different titles. In the case of interactive entertainment, consumers are consuming something like 45 hours a month, and that may be 1, 2, 3, 4 titles, but it's certainly not 100 titles. 
So from a consumer point of view, it's not clear that a subscription model really makes sense for the bulk of consumers. That remains to be seen. We're open-minded. We have made catalog titles available for subscription services. Very occasionally, we've made frontline titles available as well.

I'm pleased to report that fiscal year 2022 is off to a great start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $711 million, which exceeded our expectations. As the world has moved toward a safer, new normal, we experienced strong engagement trends across most of our core franchises. 
During the period, we took multiple steps to enhance our organization over the long term. We invested further in talent and core infrastructure, which are important areas to support our expansive multiyear pipeline. Mobile remains a key growth opportunity, and we believe that our acquisition of Nordeus will enhance meaningfully our talents and expertise in this area. With a larger mobile footprint, we've integrated Socialpoint, Playdots and Nordeus into T2 Mobile Games. This structure will enable us to realize cost synergies, leverage expertise and share best practices across our mobile teams. I'm also proud that we deepened our focus on corporate responsibility, and we've recently made several key hires to lead our efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Turning to our first quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Borderlands 3. For nearly 8 years, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online have redefined the creative and cultural influence of interactive entertainment, setting new standards for multiple generations of consumers and gaming platforms. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V were significantly above our expectations once again, and the title has now sold in more than 150 million units. 
Rockstar Games continued to keep its massive player base engaged with new content updates for Grand Theft Auto Online, including 8 new stunt races, 7 new arenas for Deadline mode and regular in-game bonuses and incentives. This helped drive the title to its second highest first quarter on record for player audience in its third consecutive quarter of player growth. In comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Grand Theft Auto Online achieved a 72% increase in its audience size, a 77% increase in new players and significant growth in recurring consumer spending. 
In addition, Rockstar Games continued to captivate and engage audiences with Red Dead Redemption 2, which exceeded our expectations and has now sold in more than 38 million units. Red Dead Online also enjoyed a strong quarter, thanks to new content offerings, including 8 new horse races and a creative array of bonuses and incentives. The game experienced strong performance as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, including 18% growth in its audience size, 26% growth in new players and outstanding growth in recurrent consumer spending. This performance was driven by both strong ongoing game sales and the continued influx of new players from the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online. 
Turning to our sports offerings. NBA 2K21 has sold in over 11 million units and remains the #1 sports title in the U.S. NBA 2K's community continues to be highly engaged with more than 2.7 million users playing daily. As compared to last year, the game experienced 13% growth in first-time spenders and nearly 30% growth in returning players. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. 
PGA TOUR 2K21 continues to exceed our expectations and expand its audience. In June, 2K and HB Studios launched a community-driven program that allows the top golf course designers from around the world to create and submit ideas for inclusion in the game's online playlist. This program is enhancing the game's vast replayability while also driving player engagement and growing its global community. 
Borderlands 3 had a strong quarter. During the period, 2K and Gearbox Software released the Director's Cut add-on, providing new missions, characters, daily and weekly challenges and unique rewards. The game was also supported with an array of new free content offerings that gave players more ways to perfect and expand their arsenals. 
2K and Firaxis Games launched Sid Meier's Civilization VI Anthology on Windows PC, providing the ultimate package for players that have yet to experience the award-winning, critically-acclaimed strategy title. The Anthology includes the base game, all previously released DLC, the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions as well as the popular New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI has sold in more than 11 million units, outperforming its predecessor at the same point in its life cycle. Later this year, 2K and Firaxis Games will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Civilization franchise, and I'd like to congratulate our teams on this incredible milestone. 
Kerbal Space Program, which has sold in over 5 million units, celebrated its 10-year anniversary in June. To mark the milestone, Private Division released a short documentary video detailing the achievements of the title as well as its impact on the aerospace industry. 
One of our key strategic priorities is to provide new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles and the communities built around them after their initial launch. During the first quarter, recurrent consumer spending declined 25%, which was better than our expectations of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. 
Overall, all evidence suggests that media consumption patterns are beginning to stabilize to a new normal. And while down from the highs of the previous year, recurrent consumer spending in our products has leveled off and remained significantly higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
The largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending in the period were NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online. We also experienced strong performance across many of our free-to-play offerings. 
Monster Legends and Dragon City exceeded our expectations with sequential top line growth compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This performance was driven by strong live ops, successful feature releases and significant marketing investments. 
Two Dots celebrated its seventh anniversary in June. The title performed well with positive momentum continuing from the second half of fiscal 2021. 
WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded over 24 million times and remains 2K's highest-grossing mobile title. The franchise has had strong performance with the last 12 months marking its sixth consecutive year of growth. 
Following our acquisition of Nordeus, we're encouraged by the performance of and the potential for Top Eleven, including its use of seasonal live ops and new features. 
NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations. The title remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 54 million registered users. 
Turning to our outlook. We're reiterating our prior guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2022. As we continue to develop our pipeline, there has been movement in some of our planned releases, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. Our approach has always been to allow our labels to determine when projects are ready to bring to market to ensure the best quality and overall experience for players. 
As Karl will discuss in greater detail, we're excited about our pipeline and the impact of our new releases will have on our business and financial profile in the years to come. We believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023 and establish new record levels of operating results over the next few years. 
Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about the future of the interactive entertainment sector and our competitive positioning. As we leverage our many advantages, our leading talent, focus on creativity, incredible portfolio of owned IP and strong balance sheet, we believe that Take-Two is well positioned to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

We continue to believe that fiscal year 2022 will be a year of investments, as marked by our recent acquisitions of Nordeus and Dynamixyz. We are thrilled to have both teams join our family, and we will continue to evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities to enhance our organization. 
I'll now discuss our recent releases. Rockstar Games continued to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. In June, Rockstar released 7 new arenas for the fan-favorite Deadline mode for Grand Theft Auto Online. This was followed by the Los Santos Tuners update, the game's major summer launch in July, which delivered an action-packed street racing-themed update into Grand Theft Auto Online. The update introduced elements of the tuner car culture to the game world, including the LS Car Meet, a new, heavily requested shared social space for players to get together to modify their personal vehicles, watch others modify their Tuner vehicles in real time, race and test various vehicles on an underground test track and much more. 
In addition, the Los Santos Tuners update features 6 epic new robbery contracts, 6 new race types, 10 new highly customizable vehicles, collectible USB sticks offering a new way to hear music from Moodymann and Seth Troxler and a host of quality-of-life updates, including a new customizable radio station wheel. 
The launch of the Los Santos Tuners set new records for Grand Theft Auto Online, including the largest number of players and the highest level of net bookings for both day 1 and during the opening week for any update in Grand Theft Auto Online's history. 
Looking ahead, the upcoming launch of the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto Online for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S systems this November will allow for higher top speeds for select vehicles across these more powerful systems. 
In July, Rockstar Games released the Bloody Money (sic) [ Blood Money ] update for Red Dead Online. The update introduced a series of criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. Blood Money's success, along with the additional influx of new players thanks to the launch of the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, led to the highest number of players on day 1 for any update in Red Dead Online history. 
Fiscal 2022 is an exciting year for Take-Two as we embark on our multiyear strategy to deliver a slate of releases more robust than any other time in our company's history. While there has been some movement in our pipeline, including 2 of our immersive core titles shifting to later this fiscal year, we remain highly optimistic about our plans, including the introduction of several new franchises. 
I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. On August 13, Private Division will launch Hades on physical disc for PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Developed by Supergiant Games, Hades is a rouge-like dungeon crawler in which players seek freedom by battling their way through the treacherous Underworld of Greek myth. The physical retail edition will come with additional items for collectors, including a compendium booklet featuring the art of the game and a code to download its soundtrack. We are excited to launch Hades, which previously won over 50 Game of the Year awards and earned impressive aggregate scores of 93 and 94 on Metacritic and OpenCritic, respectively. 
In addition, during the second quarter, Private Division will launch Murder on Eridanos, the second add-on content offering for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. 
On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts will once again set the standard for basketball simulations as they have done for the past 20 years with the launch of NBA 2K22 for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch and PC. Featuring best-in-class visual presentation and player AI, historic teams and a wide variety of hoops experiences, NBA 2K22 will place the entire basketball universe in the player's hands. 
Global phenomenon and 2-time NBA All-Star, Luka Doncic, will grace the cover of the Standard Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle, while NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Dirk Nowitzki and Kevin Durant will be featured on the premium NBA 75th Anniversary Edition. 
In North America, players can purchase a special version of the Standard Edition featuring 6-time WNBA All-Star and WNBA Champion, Candace Parker, on the cover, available exclusively through GameStop and EB Games. Parker's appearance is a milestone for the NBA 2K series, marking the first female cover athlete in the history of the franchise. 
In Japan, players can also purchase a special version of the Standard Edition that will feature Washington Wizards Rui Hachimura, a rising star who was the first Japanese player to not only be drafted in the first round in 2019, but also to reach the NBA Playoffs. 
The NBA 75th Anniversary Edition and Cross-Gen Digital Bundle will feature cover artwork painted by renowned Atlanta-based artist, Charly Palmer, whose Civil Rights series appeared on the cover of TIME Magazine in July 2020. 
This fall, Private Division will introduce Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. The title will benefit from multiple hardware advancements, which will provide upgraded resolution, increased frame rate, advanced shaders, better textures and additional performance improvements. Players who already own Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 8 consoles will be eligible for a free upgrade to the new version of the game upon its release. 
On November 11, Rockstar Games will launch the expanded and enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online - Standalone for Gen 9 consoles. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. 
This winter, Private Division will release Roll 7's OlliOlli World digitally for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Nintendo Switch and PC. The title has received outstanding initial feedback from early media impressions, including praise for its bold new direction, unique art style, standout soundtrack and improve game play mechanics. 
During the fourth quarter, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new franchise. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder and high-powered weaponry set in an unpredictable fantasy world where magic, broadswords and bullets collide. It is an entirely new game and a full stand-alone experience with a rich, story-driven co-op campaign for up to 4 players as well as repeatable end-game content. In addition, later this month, 2K will unveil details of another exciting new franchise planned for launch during this fiscal year. 
During fiscal 2020 -- '22, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. We are very excited about the team's fresh approach to the franchise, including an array of enhancements and new features. 2K and Visual Concepts have shared a series of behind the scenes videos of their work on WWE 2K22, including entrance and move animations as well as motion capture and facial scanning with much more to come.  
Turning to mobile. We are pleased to expand our offerings, especially given the strong momentum in this market segment. Players can look forward to new releases this year, which our teams will have more to share about in the coming months. In addition, our labels continue to invest in technology and new games that they plan to deliver during the next few years.  
Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League kicked off its fourth season on May 19 that will include on September 4 -- that will conclude on September 4, with the league finals delivered by Door Dash. This season, games have been airing live on the League's Twitch and YouTube channels and are also available on eGG Network in Southeast Asia, ESRevolution, Loco in India, Sport1 in Europe and Dash Radio. The League continues to grow its audience with more than 2 million followers on its social media platforms and nearly 470 million video views.  
We are excited about the League's recent announcement that its 2021 playoffs will take place at the Mavs Gaming Hub in Dallas, marking the first time that in-person games will be offered since the 2019 NBA 2K League Finals in New York City. Looking ahead, we believe that the NBA 2K League has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company. 
In closing, we are optimistic about the multiyear growth trajectory ahead of us. We are positioning our business for growth and enhancing our enterprise by investing in talent and infrastructure. With our robust pipeline of titles and content updates, we are confident that we can establish new record levels of operating performance over the next several years.

Today, I'll discuss our first quarter results and then review our financial outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
As Strauss mentioned, fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start with our first quarter operating results exceeding our expectations. Net bookings were $711 million, which was above our guidance of $625 million to $675 million and marked our second highest Q1 on record. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. 
During the period, overall engagement exceeded our expectations. Recurrent consumer spending declined 25% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online as well as the addition of Nordeus. 
Digitally delivered net bookings declined 26% as compared to our outlook of a 30% decline and accounted for 96% of the total. This result was better than our outlook primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 73% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 71% last year. 
GAAP net revenue declined 2% to $813 million, while cost of goods sold decreased 31% to $330 million. Operating expenses increased by 15% to $313 million, primarily driven by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses as well as the addition of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income was $152 million or $1.30 per share as compared to $89 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter last year. We ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. 
Turning to our guidance, I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectation. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. While our first quarter results outperformed our expectations and our acquisition of Nordeus will benefit the year, this is being offset by some changes to our release schedule, including moving 2 of our immersive core titles to later in fiscal 2022 than our prior guidance had contemplated. We continue to be very excited about our pipeline and the next phase of growth that it presents for our company. 
The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. 
We forecast a geographic net bookings split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. As a result of our outperformance in Q1 as well as the addition of Nordeus, we now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 9% compared to our prior outlook of a 15% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to be relatively flat versus last year and represent 65% of total net bookings. 
We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 6% as compared to our prior outlook of an 8% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. 
We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. The increase over our prior guidance relates to the acquisition of 2 office buildings in the U.K. to support our business in the region. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.4 billion to $1.44 billion. 
Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing at the midpoint a 23% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects significant investments in marketing, personnel, stock compensation and IT expenses to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. 
And we expect GAAP net income to range from $229 million to $259 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. 
Now moving to our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project net bookings to range from $815 million to $865 million compared to $958 million in the second quarter last year. Our guidance reflects the continued challenging comparisons from last year due to COVID-19. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Dragon City, Top Eleven and Two Dots. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 11% and digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 64% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. 
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $740 million to $790 million and cost of goods sold to range from $323 million to $349 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $368 million to $378 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 27% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher marketing, personnel, IT and research and development costs as well as the inclusion of Playdots and Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $41 million to $53 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
In closing, our first quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and the incredible execution from our talented colleagues across the world. As we capitalize on our industry's strong talent, combined with our unique business drivers, we believe that our company will deliver significant long-term growth and margin expansion for our shareholders. 
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

We're an asset-light business. We are a business of intellectual property. And our strategy, our stated strategy has always been to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business. 
Diversity is key to our success. We need to have a diverse perspective and diverse voices in order to create that quality. So it starts at the top. Our Board of Directors is diverse with respect to gender, race and skill set. Our management team is exceedingly diverse from a gender perspective. And our voices as a result are diverse. 
But we're not stopping there. We're also reaching into the community to create a broader, more diverse pool from which we can recruit and our competitors can recruit going forward. So we work together in company-sponsored service projects and the communities in which we operate. We encourage individual volunteerism and giving through philanthropic and matching donation programs. We support organizations that are focused on enhancing diversity. We increased the Canada pool through scholarships to design students, contributions to organizations providing STEM opportunities to children in underserved communities. And delivering interview training and career counseling to young adults. And this crosses genders. But in many instances, we're also focused on young females as well. 
So we're trying to do the right thing from the top of the company at the Board level to the management team, to even creating a pool from which we can recruit a long time into the future. And even so, I'm sure there's much more that we can do."

So we've got -- we've mentioned what we have as we always do. In terms of how things are trending post pandemic, if you call this post pandemic, and I hope we can, it remains to be seen, the trend is almost exactly what we anticipated and what we've talked about now for over a year, which is we expected postpandemic demand to be higher than prepandemic demand and lower than the demand during the pandemic, which stands to reason because people have, in many ways, returned to normal in most of the world. That remains to be seen. As to what will come in the future, I'm hopeful that, that will continue. 
But clearly, there's been a systemic shift in favor of interactive entertainment. It's now the #1 entertainment vertical. It's something like $180 billion market. It's a diverse market in terms of gender. It's a diverse market in terms of age. So we couldn't be more optimistic about the market than we are. 
And in terms of IDFA, it's still early days. It remains to be seen. We have not seen any negative impact on our business. And I think that's really because we're big enough that we have lots of access to data. We have a consolidated consumer database across all of our labels, which is very robust. And if you have enough of your own data and you have solid data analytics teams, which we have both at the corporate level and at the label level, then a great deal of the information can be found in other ways. And you can do appropriate marketing that protects consumers' privacy without the resources that we had before from Apple. So we're in a good place so far with regard to that change, but it is still early."

So there is a little bit of an increase of the overall operating expense in the year versus previous guidance. So it's a reduction of a little bit of marketing, offset by the Nordeus expense. 
And in terms of the return on marketing spend, I wouldn't say there's better or worse. I would say that we're a little bit more targeted on how we're spending our marketing. So I'd say we were getting a better return because we're able to really see how we're spending the marketing in a better way with better analytics over the last few years. But the spend continues to be a strong spend in order to do the best marketing for our titles, especially also with the mobile titles as well."

Look, let's just pause at the -- inclusion, diversity and common decency is of paramount importance to everyone here and specifically highly important to me and has been for the 14 years that we've been around. This is nothing new for us. The culture of the company is well-known and well-known internally and reasonably well-known externally. All that said, we can always do better. And I think we're known to be people who always want to be doing better and never want to rest on our laurels. 
We don't think that fostering an appropriate environment is a single set of actions or reflects  1 day in a new cycle. We think it's a constant process of introspection and improvement. There are always ways that we and the industry can do better. We'll listen to our colleagues, and we'll work on this area over time. 
But I want to be very specific because you asked the question about what we do around here and what we've always done. The first is, and I'll say it in as black and white a way as I can, we will not tolerate harassment or discrimination or bad behavior of any kind. We never have. We set those expectations when people come on board here through our code of conduct and our anti-harassment and antidiscrimination policies, all of which our colleagues are required to review and sign when they're hired. All of our colleagues take anti-harassment training at hire and biannually after that. And we make it clear through the training and through our policy that if anyone does experience any inappropriate contact, there are multiple avenues to report that, and they'll never be retaliated against for doing so. Those options include the management chain, anyone in HR, an anonymous complaint by phone or online through our third-party hotline and website reporting tools. 
Take-Two has a director of diversity and inclusion, and that [indiscernible] includes developing, executing and leading a global DE&I strategy, and that supports our business objectives. We also have multiple employee resource groups inside the company, and we have more growing all the time, which gives us all a thrill. So that's what we're up to very specifically. Again, is there more that we could do? I'm certain there is. Do we feel like we're in a pretty good place? We're grateful that we do feel that way right now. 
In terms of retention, our turnover rate is roughly half of the industries. That's been true for about the past 18 months. There have been times when it's been about 70% of industry levels. It's been trending down at a time when I think, in general, turnover is trending up. So we feel good about that. And that's another measure of how we're doing, so we focus on it."

We're experiencing what we expected, but we're also seeing instances like, for example, when the new movies came out for GTA Online, we're seeing record engagement. So that in itself shows you that the sort of the moderation that we've seen is really coming to an end because people are engaging when the content is released, and they're engaging in a very significant way. So that gives us a lot of confidence that we may be past the, I guess, you call them headwinds of losing the tailwinds of the pandemic, and we moved on to where the titles are behaving as we would expect in a more normalized environment. So we can see it in the numbers themselves. 
In terms of centralizing the studios and mobile under 1 umbrella, we do expect that there will be synergies across the organizations. Each of these studios has got something to bring in terms of expertise, whether it's data analytics, whether it's different ways to create content. There are a lot of things that they can learn from each other, and bringing them together under 1 management umbrella really gives us the ability -- not to mention also consumer data, really gives us the ability to pursue best practices across the entire organization. So yes, we do expect there to be synergies based on this reorganization."

I think you raised a good point, which is over time, will it be harder for smaller companies to compete in the space? And I think that will be true. The answer will be yes with regard to both mobile and console. The resources required are significant. The risk profile is significant. And the history of the entertainment business is that over time, those that are very creative become very successful. Those that are very successful become bigger. Those that are bigger have the opportunity to acquire smaller enterprises. And as long as the focus remains on creativity, innovation and efficiency and as long as the culture that has made the company successful in the first place is maintained, there's an opportunity for continued success even with scale.

We think that a subscription model can make sense for deep catalog titles, but it doesn't really make sense for frontline titles. And for any business model that makes sense in the entertainment business, it has to work for the creators of the entertainment as well as the consumers of the entertainment. And I think catalog can make sense for the publishers. It can make sense for consumers who are avid, who really want access to a lot of product. 
But if you're getting into frontline product, then the economics are much more difficult to make sense of. And remember, consumers who are involved with interactive entertainment have different consumption patterns than those involved with linear entertainment. Linear entertainment consumers consume something like 150 hours of programming a month. That's probably well over 100 different titles. In the case of interactive entertainment, consumers are consuming something like 45 hours a month, and that may be 1, 2, 3, 4 titles, but it's certainly not 100 titles. 
So from a consumer point of view, it's not clear that a subscription model really makes sense for the bulk of consumers. That remains to be seen. We're open-minded. We have made catalog titles available for subscription services. Very occasionally, we've made frontline titles available as well.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 30% over last year.",1371,"Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 30% over last year. We experienced consistently strong engagement trends across our key franchises, underscoring the durability of our offerings and the deep relationships that we've established with new, existing and returning players. We believe that we can maintain these favorable engagement patterns as we continue to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences that are driven by our team's passion and commitment to creativity and innovation. 
We've been taking key actions to execute on our long-term strategic vision. We continue to enhance and diversify our pipeline across an array platforms business models and genres. To support this, we're investing in our infrastructure and making key hires, ranging from senior talent at our labels to the addition of more than 350 new developers during the second quarter. 
We're pleased with the progress of T2 Mobile Games, which is helping us leverage our team's expertise across our enterprise. Additionally, Nordeus has already reached key integration milestones. We continue to build upon our ESG efforts, and we hope to share more in the coming months. 
Given our strong confidence in our company, we opportunistically repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the second quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67. This marks the first time in over 2 years that we repurchased our stock, underscoring the deep value that we observed in our share price. In November, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 7.4 million shares that the company is permitted to repurchase, resulting in 10 million shares remaining available for repurchase as of the date of the additional authorization. 
Turning to our second quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K22, with more players hitting the digital hard court in its first month than any prior release of the game. The title enjoyed outstanding initial success with over 5 million units sold in to date. Players are deeply engaged, and we're experiencing growth in daily active users and daily games played per user compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period. 
For the quarter, the NBA 2K series delivered exceptional results that were significantly above our expectations. NBA 2K22 experienced growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as a 4% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 58% increase in new user spending. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. We see a meaningful opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide engaging and frequent content updates throughout the game. 
Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold in more than 155 million units worldwide. During the period, Rockstar Games launched another major update for Grand Theft Auto Online's evolving world. The Los Santos Tuners update brought a renewed focus to the underground street racing scene and introduced a host of innovative and highly requested features, including the LS car meet, a shared social space where players can get together to modify, test and raise their cars, get tattoos and more. Los Santos Tuners also added 17 highly customizable vehicles, a purchasable auto workshop, new robbery contracts and street races and the ability to add music in a new way through collectible media sticks. 
Recurrent consumer spending increased 33%, and active player audience increased 11%, representing the strongest second quarter on record for both metrics. The success of Los Santos Tuners demonstrates Rockstar's ability both to anticipate the needs of its players and to respond to player feedback with an ongoing stream of high quality and engaging content. 
During the quarter, Red Dead Redemption 2 also significantly outperformed our expectations and, to date, has sold in more than 39 million units worldwide. Momentum continued in Red Dead Online with the introduction of the Bloody Money update in July, which introduced a series of new criminal themed opportunities, complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery and the QuickDraw Club, a series of 4 distinct rapid fire passes featuring criminal themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. As a result of the Blood Money update as well as the influx of new players attributable to the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, we experienced a 26% increase in active players and a 29% increase in new online player acquisition. Recurrent consumer spending for the series was also notably above expectations. 
In August, Private Division expanded their portfolio with the physical release of Hades for PlayStation and Xbox platforms. Title continues to earn positive praise from the gaming community and is currently Metacritic's highest rated game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. In September, the label released Murder on Eridanos, the final expansion for the Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. We're pleased that the Outer Worlds continues to grow its audience. And to date, the title has sold in over 4 million units. 
Also in September, Private Division launched Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for gen 9 consoles, taking advantage of the latest performance and the visual enhancements to provide players an exciting new way to experience this beloved space flight simulation game. 
During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 7%, which was significantly ahead of our expectations of an 11% decline and accounted for [ 69% ] of net bookings. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer engagement trends were consistently strong even as people resume more normal socialization patterns and as schools and workplaces began to reopen. We're very optimistic about our continued ability to keep players engaged and to capitalize further on our massive audience size. 
For the period, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending. Many of our free-to-play offerings were also notable drivers. Top 11 exceeded our expectations driven by strong seasonal live ops and features, optimized marketing activities and enhanced user quality. 
Dragon City and Monster Legends performed well, thanks to strong live ops, new updates and feature releases and increased marketing investments. Two Dots achieved its highest ever net bookings since our acquisition, which we attribute to new and game events such as Scavenger Hunts and curated seasonal content. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 24 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game. NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations and remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 55 million registered users. 
We continue to monitor the regulatory environment. It bears noting that China represents 3% of our net bookings in fiscal '21. While we remain optimistic about China and we'll pursue further opportunity there, we believe that our exposure to the region will remain limited in the context of our growing overall net bookings. 
Turning to our guidance. As a result of our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly. 
With the strongest multiyear pipeline in our company's history, we continue to believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal '23 and establish new records of operating results over the next few years. 
Our focus on bringing new intellectual properties to market will help us diversify our portfolio further and build lasting franchises that we believe will enhance our financial profile for years to come. At the same time, our teams are hard at work developing sequels to many of our beloved franchises that we know our consumers will be eager to play. 
As we execute on our strategic vision and maintain our commitment to an outstanding and collaborative culture, we believe that we will significantly grow our operations and drive long-term shareholder value. 
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

We're thrilled that the community continues to grow with a title selling in over 2.5 million units to date. 
On October 19, 2K launched NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade, building on the success of its predecessor, which continues to be listed as one of the platform's top games with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars across more than 85,000 ratings. NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition expands the franchise's addressable market with new modes and features, including the association, MYCOR and more. 
Rockstar Games continue to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. To celebrate Halloween, Grand Theft Auto Online added a series of random events to shock and surprise players, including driverless vans and killer cars, superhuman slashes, UFOs and more, including bonuses on alien and survival modes and the new arcade game. Players will also be able to experience an all-new adventure in the Grand Theft Auto Online later this year as they help some well-known contacts and familiar faces with many more surprises yet to be revealed. 
I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games will digitally launch Grand Theft Auto, the Trilogy, the definitive addition this November 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and the Rockstar Games Launcher for PC. The definitive edition will feature across-the-board upgrades for all free games, including graphical improvements and modern controls while still maintaining the classic and distinct aesthetic of the original games.

In September, the team unveiled the game's brand-new mechanics and all-star celebrity cast, including Will Arnett, Ashley Burch, Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes. Fans reaction to the first look at the game play was extremely positive, reflecting the growing excitement for this fantasy fuel take on the popular looter shooter [indiscernible]. 
In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K22, which will be released in March. Our partners at WWE have done amazing things with their brands, resulting in a passionate and deeply engaged community. And they're providing tremendous support to maximize our campaign through all their platforms, including social media, digital programming, talent and arena and more. Visual Concepts is gearing up for a major review of the game's key features in January, which we look forward to sharing with fans, followed by the biggest WWE 2K launch to date. 
Rockstar Games is thrilled to launch the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online stand-alone for gen 9 consoles in March. Players will enjoy a range of technical and graphical improvements across the entire experience, including performance enhancements for select vehicles in Grand Theft Auto Online and much more. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. 
As we noted in our earnings release, Marvel's Midnight Sun from Firaxis Games is now expected to be released in the second half of calendar 2022 during our fiscal year 2023. While we don't take delays lightly, we know that our proven success has been rooted firmly in our player-first approach and unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences. We believe it is far better to provide the extra time needed for a product, especially in new IP, to reach its full potential and drive long-term success as a permanent franchise in our industry-leading portfolio. 
As gaming platforms continue to evolve, technological advancements allow us to design experiences that are more immersive and engaging than ever before. While this has enabled us to significantly grow our franchises over time, game development has become more complex, especially with many of our colleagues still working remotely. 
We continue to evaluate and optimize our game creation processes to enhance the ways that our teams collaborate, share best practices and leverage technology and expertise. 
Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its fourth season, attracting more than 18 million unique viewers and over 2 million hours of games watched on Twitch.

In addition, the league hosted their inaugural All-Star game held at Brooklyn Seal in New York. 
As part of Elite's continued global expansion, Mexico's Duke's Gaming will launch a team this spring, marking the 24th team and the first to participate from Latin America. We are thrilled to see the league continue to grow both its audience and global presence. 
In closing, we have a strong foundation for success that has helped us curate a portfolio of highly engaging franchises that transcend console and player generations. As we continue to harness and enhance our competitive advantages, our incredible creative talent, best-in-class marketing and technology and strong balance sheet, we will introduce new entertainment experiences that we believe have vast commercial potential and the ability to drive long-term engagement and recurrent consumer spending. We also expect to continue to attract the very best creators who share in our vision to set new benchmarks and captivate audiences throughout the world.

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2022 and the third quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. 
As Strauss mentioned, our business fundamentals remain exceptionally strong across our key franchises. Net bookings were $985 million, which was significantly above our guidance of $815 million to [ $865 ] million and up 3% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. During the period, overall engagement was outstanding, with recurrent consumer spending increasing 7% compared to our outlook of an 11% decline and accounting for [ 69% ] of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by NBA 2K. 
Digitally delivered net bookings increased 9% compared to our outlook of a 5% decline and accounted for 89% of the total. This result was better than our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 65% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year. 
GAAP net revenue increased 2% to $858 million, while cost of goods sold increased 6% to $457 million. Cost of goods sold included a $53 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of an unannounced title in our pipeline. 
Operating expenses increased by 30% to $381 million. The variance is driven by higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses, the addition of Playdots and Nordeus and the revaluation of the Nordeus earnout. And GAAP net income was $10 million or $0.09 per share as compared to $99 million or $0.86 per share in the second quarter last year. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67. 
Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion due to our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, which includes the move of Marvel's Midnight Sons into fiscal 2023. 
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our label to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. 
We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 6% compared to our prior outlook of a 9% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to represent 66% of total net bookings, slightly above 65% last year. 
We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 4% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. 
We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures. We're raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.51 billion to $1.55 billion. 
Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion, representing at the midpoint a 22% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects costs relating to marketing, personnel, stock compensation, IT and research and development to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. Our operating expense expectations have improved compared to our prior guidance driven by lower marketing expenses due to the movements in our release schedule. And we expect GAAP net income to range from $320 million to $350 million or $2.75 to $3 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be [ 16% ] throughout fiscal 2022. 
And now moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million compared to [ $814 ] million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors in our bookings are reflected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto, the Trilogy, the definitive edition. We project recurrent consumer spending to be up slightly compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 61% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 56% last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range $840 million to $890 million and cost of goods sold to range from $344 million to $370 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $378 million to $388 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year driven primarily by higher personnel, research and development and IT expenses as well as the inclusion of Nintendo. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $99 million to $111 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share. 
In closing, our second quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and our continued ability to engage our players with exciting and innovative new content. As we continue to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities, we believe that we will greatly expand our scale and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.

And when VR first emerged as a potential technology, while I expressed some skepticism about it becoming a very broad-based consumer application, I also thought it was really exciting technically and said that we would participate. Rockstar has already bought [ LNR ] to VR. NBA 2K has come to VR. I'm sure we'll have more VR titles in the future as well. 
So we're always excited when our creative teams can flex their collective muscles and do different things and remains to be seen just how big that can be. We never make projections like that, but we're very excited about the opportunity."

We've done companion apps, and we've brought modified games or different iterations of franchises like WWE SuperCard or NBA SuperCard.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm pleased to report that we delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighted by net bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 3% over last year. We experienced consistently strong engagement trends across our key franchises, underscoring the durability of our offerings and the deep relationships that we've established with new, existing and returning players. We believe that we can maintain these favorable engagement patterns as we continue to deliver the highest quality entertainment experiences that are driven by our team's passion and commitment to creativity and innovation.
We've been taking key actions to execute on our long-term strategic vision. We continue to enhance and diversify our pipeline across an array of platforms, business models and genres. To support this, we're investing in our infrastructure and making key hires, ranging from senior talent at our labels, to the addition of more than 350 new developers during the second quarter. We're pleased with the progress of T2 Mobile Games, which is helping us leverage our team's expertise across our enterprise. Additionally, Nordeus has already reached key integration milestones. We continue to build upon our ESG efforts, and we hope to share more in the coming months.
Given our strong confidence in our company, we opportunistically repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the second quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67. This marks the first time in over 2 years that we repurchased our stock, underscoring the deep value that we observed in our share price. In November, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 7.4 million shares that the company is permitted to repurchase, resulting in 10 million shares remaining available for repurchase as of the date of the additional authorization.
Turning to our second quarter results. Our better-than-expected performance was driven primarily by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online.
On September 10, 2K and Visual Concepts successfully launched NBA 2K22, with more players hitting the digital hard court in its first month than any prior release of the game. The title enjoyed outstanding initial success with over 5 million units sold-in to date. Players are deeply engaged and we're experiencing growth in daily active users and daily games played per user compared to NBA 2K21 in the same period.
For the quarter, the NBA 2K series delivered exceptional results that were significantly above our expectations. NBA 2K22 experienced growth in recurrent consumer spending as well as a 4% increase in total in-game purchasers and a 58% increase in new user spending. I'd like to congratulate the teams at 2K and Visual Concepts for once again delivering such a stellar basketball experience. We see a meaningful opportunity to grow the franchise further over the next few years as we provide engaging and frequent content updates throughout the game.
Sales of Grand Theft Auto V continue to exceed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold-in more than 155 million units worldwide.
During the period, Rockstar Games launched another major update for Grand Theft Auto Online's evolving world. The Los Santos Tuners update brought a renewed focus to the underground street racing scene and introduced a host of innovative and highly requested features, including the LS Car Meet, a shared social space where players can get together to modify, test and race their cars, get tattoos and more. Los Santos Tuners also added 17 highly customizable vehicles, a purchasable auto workshop, new robbery contracts and street races and the ability to add music in a new way through collectible media sticks.
Recurrent consumer spending increased 33% and active player audience increased 11%, representing the strongest second quarter on record for both metrics. The success of Los Santos Tuners demonstrates Rockstar's ability both to anticipate the needs of its players and to respond to player feedback with an ongoing stream of high quality and engaging content.
During the quarter, Red Dead Redemption 2 also significantly outperformed our expectations and to date has sold-in more than 39 million units worldwide.
Momentum continued in Red Dead Online with the introduction of the Blood Money update in July, which introduced a series of new criminal-themed opportunities; complex new missions, including the game's first train robbery; and The Quick Draw Club, a series of 4 distinct, rapid-fire passes featuring criminal-themed unlockable rewards, bonuses and more. As a result of the Blood Money update as well as the influx of new players attributable to the stand-alone version of Red Dead Online, we experienced a 26% increase in active players and a 29% increase in new online player acquisition. Recurrent consumer spending for the series was also notably above expectations.
In August, Private Division expanded their portfolio with the physical release of Hades for PlayStation and Xbox platforms. The title continues to earn positive praise from the gaming community and is currently Metacritic's highest rated game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. In September, the label released Murder on Eridanos, the final expansion for The Outer Worlds for the Nintendo Switch. We're pleased that The Outer Worlds continues to grow its audience. And to date, the title has sold-in over 4 million units. Also in September, Private Division launched Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition for Gen 9 consoles, taking advantage of the latest performance and the visual enhancements to provide players an exciting new way to experience this beloved space flight simulation game.
During the quarter, recurrent consumer spending rose 7%, which was significantly ahead of our expectations of an 11% decline and accounted for 69% of net bookings. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer engagement trends were consistently strong even as people resume more normal socialization patterns and as schools and workplaces began to reopen. We're very optimistic about our continued ability to keep players engaged and to capitalize further on our massive audience size.
For the period, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online were the largest contributors to recurrent consumer spending. Many of our free-to-play offerings were also notable drivers. Top Eleven exceeded our expectations driven by strong seasonal live ops and features, optimized marketing activities and enhanced user quality. Dragon City and Monster Legends performed well, thanks to strong live ops, new updates and feature releases and increased marketing investments. Two Dots achieved its highest ever net bookings since our acquisition, which we attribute to new in-game events such as scavenger hunts and curated seasonal content. WWE SuperCard has now been downloaded more than 24 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile game.
NBA 2K Online in China outperformed our expectations and remains the #1 online PC sports game in the region with nearly 55 million registered users. We continue to monitor the regulatory environment. It bears noting that China represents 3% of our net bookings in fiscal '21. While we remain optimistic about China and we'll pursue further opportunity there, we believe that our exposure to the region will remain limited in the context of our growing overall net bookings.
Turning to our guidance. As a result of our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal year 2022, and we now expect to achieve net bookings of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Lainie will provide more details shortly.
With the strongest multiyear pipeline in our company's history, we continue to believe that we'll achieve sequential growth in net bookings in fiscal '23 and establish new records of operating results over the next few years.
Our focus on bringing new intellectual properties to market will help us diversify our portfolio further and build lasting franchises that we believe will enhance our financial profile for years to come. At the same time, our teams are hard at work developing sequels to many of our beloved franchises that we know our consumers will be eager to play.
As we execute on our strategic vision and maintain our commitment to an outstanding and collaborative culture, we believe that we will significantly grow our operations and drive long-term shareholder value.
I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'll now discuss our recent releases. On October 1, 2K and Hangar 13 launched the Mafia III: Definitive Edition for Stadia. Previously released on other platforms, the Definitive Edition offers many additional features and post-launch content that has since been incorporated into the game. We're pleased to continue our support for Stadia and expand the Mafia franchise to new audiences.
On October 11, Nordeus released Top Eleven 2022 on iOS and Android, the latest installment of the world's most successful soccer management game. Top Eleven 2022 delivers a significant update to the gameplay and soccer management experience, pitting aspiring soccer managers against one another in league, cup and friendly matches. Top Eleven 2022 also provides a significant new layer of depth to player development via the Playstyles feature, which helps to enhance the soccer fantasy that Top Eleven has been providing to fans for more than a decade.
On October 14, 2K and HB Studios launched the PGA TOUR 2K21 Baller Edition, which includes the base game, all previously released DLC courses and game modes, an assortment of adidas apparel and gear and the Golden Touch Pack that features a gold putter and driver. In addition, PGA TOUR 2K21 offers new multiplayer courses each month designed by a group of international content creators. We're thrilled that the community continues to grow with the title selling-in over 2.5 million units to date.
On October 19, 2K launched NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade, building on the success of its predecessor, which continues to be listed as one of the platform's top games with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars across more than 85,000 ratings. NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition expands the franchise's addressable market with new modes and features, including The Association, MyCOURT and more.
Rockstar Games continue to provide an array of free content for their vast and growing online communities. To celebrate Halloween, Grand Theft Auto Online added a series of random events to shock and surprise players, including driverless phantom killer cars, superhuman slashers, UFOs and more, including bonuses on Alien Survival modes and a new Arcade game. Players will also be able to experience an all-new adventure in the Grand Theft Auto Online later this year as they help some well-known contacts and familiar faces with many more surprises yet to be revealed.
I'll now discuss details on our upcoming announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games will digitally launch Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition this November 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and the Rockstar Games Launcher for PC. The Definitive Edition will feature across-the-board upgrades for all 3 games, including graphical improvements and modern controls, while still maintaining the classic and distinct aesthetic of the original games. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition will launch physically for consoles on December 7 and will release for iOS and Android devices in the first half of calendar 2022. As part of the celebration of the recent 20th anniversary, Grand Theft Auto III fans can also collect an array of special commemorative gear in Grand Theft Auto Online throughout a series of upcoming events this fall.
On November 12, 2K and Gearbox Software will release limited quantities of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition physically for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Avid Vault Hunters and newcomers alike are sure to enjoy this quintessential Borderlands 3 experience, featuring the award-winning base game, plus all 6 content add-ons and the full collection of bonus cosmetic packs. The Ultimate Edition is optimized to take full advantage of the Gen 9 hardware's processing power, enabling gameplay at up to 60 frames per second in 4K resolution during single player and online co-op.
OlliOlli World, the skateboarding action-platformer developed by Roll7, launches this winter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PC and Nintendo Switch.
On March 25, 2K and Gearbox Software will launch an exciting new entry from the Borderlands universe, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. In September, the team unveiled the game's brand-new mechanics and all-star celebrity cast, including Will Arnett, Ashly Burch, Andy Samberg and Wanda Sykes. Fans' reactions to the first look at the gameplay was extremely positive, reflecting the growing excitement for this fantasy-fueled take on the popular looter-shooter genre.
In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K22, which will be released in March. Our partners at WWE have done amazing things with their brand, resulting in a passionate and deeply engaged community. And they're providing tremendous support to maximize our campaign through all their platforms, including social media, digital, programming, talent, in-arena and more. Visual Concepts is gearing up for a major reveal of the game's key features in January, which we look forward to sharing with fans, followed by the biggest WWE 2K launch to date.
Rockstar Games is thrilled to launch the expanded and enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online – Standalone for Gen 9 consoles in March. Players will enjoy a range of technical and graphical improvements across the entire experience, including performance enhancements for select vehicles in Grand Theft Auto Online and much more. Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months.
As we noted in our earnings release, Marvel's Midnight Suns from Firaxis Games is now expected to be released in the second half of calendar 2022 during our fiscal year 2023. While we don't take delays lightly, we know that our proven success has been rooted firmly in our player-first approach and unwavering commitment to delivering the highest quality entertainment experiences. We believe it is far better to provide the extra time needed for a product, especially a new IP, to reach its full potential and drive long-term success as a permanent franchise in our industry-leading portfolio. As gaming platforms continue to evolve, technological advancements allow us to design experiences that are more immersive and engaging than ever before. While this has enabled us to significantly grow our franchises over time, game development has become more complex, especially with many of our colleagues still working remotely.
We continue to evaluate and optimize our game creation processes to enhance the ways that our teams collaborate, share best practices and leverage technology and expertise.
Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League concluded its fourth season, attracting more than 18 million unique viewers and over 2 million hours of games watched on Twitch. During the playoffs and finals, nearly 4 million unique viewers tuned in as Wizards District Gaming won their second consecutive championship. In addition, the League hosted their inaugural All-Star Game held at Brooklyn Steel in New York. As part of the League's continued global expansion, Mexico's DUX Gaming will launch a team this spring, marking the 24th team and the first to participate from Latin America. We are thrilled to see the League continue to grow both its audience and global presence.
In closing, we have a strong foundation for success that has helped us curate a portfolio of highly engaging franchises that transcend console and player generations. As we continue to harness and enhance our competitive advantages, our incredible creative talent, best-in-class marketing and technology and strong balance sheet, we will introduce new entertainment experiences that we believe have vast commercial potential and the ability to drive long-term engagement and recurrent consumer spending. We also expect to continue to attract the very best creators who share in our vision to set new benchmarks and captivate audiences throughout the world.
I'll now turn the call over to Lainie."

Today, I'll discuss our second quarter results and then review our financial outlook for fiscal year 2022 and the third quarter. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release.
As Strauss mentioned, our business fundamentals remain exceptionally strong across our key franchises. Net bookings were $985 million, which was significantly above our guidance of $815 million to $865 million and up 3% as compared to last year. Our outperformance was primarily driven by Borderlands 3, NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online. During the period, overall engagement was outstanding, with recurrent consumer spending increasing 7% compared to our outlook of an 11% decline and accounting for 69% of total net bookings. Our outperformance was primarily driven by NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings increased 9% compared to our outlook of a 5% decline and accounted for 89% of the total. This result was better than our outlook, primarily due to the outperformance of recurrent consumer spending. During the quarter, 65% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 57% last year.
GAAP net revenue increased 2% to $858 million, while cost of goods sold increased 6% to $457 million. Cost of goods sold included a $53 million impairment charge related to our decision not to proceed with further development of an unannounced title in our pipeline.
Operating expenses increased by 30% to $381 million. The variance is driven by higher personnel, marketing and IT expenses; the addition of Playdots and Nordeus and the revaluation of the Nordeus earnout.
And GAAP net income was $10 million or $0.09 per share as compared to $99 million or $0.86 per share in the second quarter last year.
We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 1.26 million shares of our stock during the quarter for approximately $200 million with an average share price of $158.67.
Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. We are raising our net bookings outlook range to $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. This is up from our prior outlook of $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion due to our second quarter outperformance, along with our updated forecast for the balance of the year, which includes the move of Marvel's Midnight Suns into fiscal 2023.
The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 50% 2K, 40% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division and T2 Mobile Games. We forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international.
We now expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 6% compared to our prior outlook of a 9% decline versus fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net bookings, recurrent consumer spending is expected to represent 66% of total net bookings, slightly above 65% last year.
We now project digitally delivered net bookings to decrease by approximately 4% compared to our prior outlook of a 6% decline. As a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 90%, slightly above 89% last year. Our forecast assumes that 73% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year.
We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $170 million for capital expenditures.
We're raising our GAAP net revenue outlook to $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, while we now expect cost of goods sold to range from $1.51 billion to $1.55 billion.
Total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.47 billion to $1.49 billion, representing at the midpoint a 22% increase over the prior year. This increase reflects costs relating to marketing, personnel, stock compensation, IT and research and development to bring our expansive multiyear pipeline to market as well as incremental expenses due to the addition of Nordeus and a full year of Playdots. Our operating expense expectations have improved compared to our prior guidance driven by lower marketing expenses due to the movement in our release schedule.
And we expect GAAP net income to range from $320 million to $350 million or $2.75 to $3 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022.
And now moving to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $800 million to $850 million compared to $814 million in the third quarter last year. The largest contributors in our bookings are reflected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition. We project recurrent consumer spending to be up slightly compared to last year and digitally delivered net bookings to increase by approximately 5%. Our forecast assumes that 61% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 56% last year.
We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $840 million to $890 million and cost of goods sold to range from $344 million to $370 million. Operating expenses are expected to range from $378 million to $388 million. At the midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel, research and development and IT expenses as well as the inclusion of Nordeus. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $99 million to $111 million or $0.85 to $0.95 per share.
In closing, our second quarter results demonstrate the health of our business and our continued ability to engage our players with exciting and innovative new content. As we continue to capitalize on organic and inorganic growth opportunities, we believe that we will greatly expand our scale and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

I mean, the reviews have been great. User feedback has been great. Engagement has been really, really strong.
One thing to note is that we did add the seasons feature to MyPLAYER this year, which obviously creates a lot more content drops and a lot more for folks to do. Every time you increase content and deliver content, that obviously leads to increased engagement and tends to lead to increased monetization. So it's really a combination of the game just being better. We had a lot of wind in our backs, too, from an increased player base, generally speaking.

Rockstar has already brought L.A. Noire to VR. NBA 2K has come to VR. I'm sure we'll have more VR titles in the future as well.
So we're always excited when our creative teams can flex their collective muscles and do different things and remains to be seen just how big that can be. We never make projections like that, but we're very excited about the opportunity."

We've done companion apps, and we've brought modified games or different iterations of franchises like WWE SuperCard or NBA SuperCard.
So we are no stranger to bringing our core franchises to the mobile space. We definitely think that there's an opportunity for us to do more. Nothing to announce on the call. But look, obviously, we've invested significantly in this space, both through acquisition and also organically, and we don't expect that to stop anytime soon."

Our strong fourth quarter performance concluded an exceptional year for our organization. We delivered net bookings of approximately $3.6 billion, which grew nearly 20% from fiscal 2020 and were the highest ever in our company's history. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues around the world for helping us achieve these results despite such significant unforeseen and prolonged challenges. It's truly a reflection of our collective resilience and singular commitment to excellence. Our thoughts are with those who have been and continue to be affected by COVID-19. We hope that better days and comfort will come to you soon. 
Throughout the pandemic, our creative teams have delivered consistently superlative entertainment experiences, giving players opportunities to have fun in the most difficult of times and stay connected with family and friends through shared experiences. We grew our online communities meaningfully, including new and returning players, which helped drive recurrent consumer spending growth of 48% to reach a record high and represents 63% of our total net bookings for fiscal 2021. 
During the year, we enhanced our organization for the long term. We bolstered the depth of our creative teams by hiring more than 700 new developers, including through the acquisition of several talented studios which will help us expand our capabilities and grow our business. We also broadened our portfolio of offerings, capitalized on diverse business models and made significant investments in our operations and infrastructure. Nearly all of our titles outperformed during the fourth quarter, including NBA 2K21, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Sid Meier's Civilization VI. 
The NBA 2K series is known throughout the world for being the most authentic, the most realistic and the most engaging basketball simulation experience in our industry. In addition to giving consumers the ability to step onto the court of their favorite NBA players or as themselves, 2K and Visual Concepts have created various game modes that offer interactive experiences and enable players to build deeper social connections. NBA 2K21 was our first offering built from the ground up for Gen 9 platforms. 
To date, the title has exceeded our expectations and sold in over 10 million units. During the fourth quarter, net bookings for the series grew 37% and recurrent consumer spending exceeded our expectations significantly, growing 32% and 73% in the period and fiscal year, respectively. Consumer engagement with NBA 2K remains incredibly strong with more than 2.3 million users playing the game daily. We see a significant opportunity to grow the franchise further as we provide unique and innovative experiences throughout the game. 
Once again, Rockstar Games' iconic Grand Theft Auto series exceeded our expectations, expanded its audience and set new benchmarks in fiscal 2021. Driven by an array of new free content updates and sustained interest in last holidays, Cayo Perico Heist, Grand Theft Auto Online benefited from strong engagement trends during the fourth quarter, including a record number of active players and the second highest quarter of recurrent consumer spending on record. 
For the full year, participation levels reached an all-time high from both new and returning players and recurrent consumer spending grew 31%, achieving a new annual record. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V also surpassed our expectations. And to date, the title has sold in more than 145 million units worldwide. Red Dead Online exceeded our expectations during the fourth quarter with active players increasing significantly in recurrent consumer spending performing above our plans, due in part to the success of the recently released stand-alone version of the game. 
Throughout the period, Rockstar Games released new content updates for Red Dead Online, including brand-new missions for solo players, the Outlaw Pass #5 and its new rewards and more. Red Dead Redemption 2 continued to perform very well and to date has sold in over 37 million units worldwide. During the fourth quarter, 2K announced our acquisition of HB Studios, the developers of our highly successful golf game PGA Tour 2K21, which to date has sold in more than 2 million units. We're very excited about the growth potential for the PGA Tour 2K series, especially as 2K has entered into an exclusive long-term agreement with golf legend and icon Tiger Woods to serve as its Executive Director and consultant, which we believe will enhance the series' ongoing innovation and authenticity. 
During the period, 2K and Firaxis Games released the Vietnam and Kublai Khan, and Portugal packs for Sid Meier's Civilization VI that were the final offerings for the game's incredibly successful New Frontier Pass. Civilization VI's daily active users have grown steadily since the game's release more than 5 years ago. And to date, the title has sold in over 11 million units. As a result of the engagement from the past as well as the success of XCOM: Chimera Squad and XCOM 2 on Switch, Firaxis Games had one of its best years ever. We expect this growth to continue as the studio has several exciting projects in development that will be revealed this year. 
During the fourth quarter, Private Division released Murder on Eridanos, the final add-on for their highly successful game in The Outer Worlds, which has sold in more than 3 million units. The add-on will also be coming to switch later this year. Private Division's 2019 release, Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey has now sold in over 1 million units, marking the third title from the label to achieve the million unit milestone joining The Outer Worlds and Kerbal Space Program. 
Providing new and innovative ways for audiences to stay engaged with our titles after their initial launch is a key strategic priority of our organization and represents an important long-term growth and margin opportunity. Our record levels of recurring consumer spending were largely driven by NBA 2K and Grand Theft Auto Online during the fourth quarter and were enhanced by the following offerings. Social Point's live games led by Dragon City and Monster Legends exceeded our expectations. Strong seasonal content and features as well as increased marketing investments helped drive net bookings growth of nearly 30% for the period and 44% for the year. The studio is planning to release 3 new titles during the second half of fiscal 2022. 
PlayDots had a strong fourth quarter driven by the outstanding performance of Two Dots, which achieved sequential growth over the third quarter. We expect PlayDots to be a significant contributor to our results over the long term. And look forward to its new release plan for the fall. WWE SuperCard also outperformed, growing 24% during the fourth quarter and 28% during the year. The title has now been downloaded more than 23 million times and remains 2K's highest grossing mobile title. 
NBA 2K Online in China grew 6% and 9% during the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, and remains a significant contributor to our results. The title is the #1 PC online sports game in China with more than 52 million registered users. 
Turning to our outlook. We believe that the pandemic initiated a transformational shift in entertainment consumption, revealing the possibilities of interactive entertainment to a much broader market with interactive entertainment becoming the #1 entertainment vertical. We anticipate that the overall addressable market for our industry will be notably larger going forward than it was pre-pandemic. However, as the world returns to a new normal, we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. 
We currently expect our fiscal 2022 net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, marking the second year in a row with net bookings in excess of $3 billion. We expect to achieve sequential growth in fiscal 2023. And over the next few years, we believe that we will establish new records of operating results even above the spectacular performance we delivered this past year. Lainie will share more details about our outlook. 
As Karl will discuss in greater detail, in fiscal 2022, we plan to deliver an exciting array of offerings including 4 immersive core releases from proven and new franchises. With the strongest pipeline in our company's history, including many new releases planned for fiscal 2023 and 2024, we're highly optimistic about our growth trajectory, and we'll be making significant investments this year to enhance our enterprise in key areas such as creative talent, IT and other infrastructure. In closing, we remain confident in our proven strategy and talented teams around the world. As we continue to grow our business, we believe that Take-Two is exceedingly well positioned to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Karl."

I'd like to begin by thanking our teams around the world for delivering a record year. Since joining Take 2 in 2007, I can't remember a year during which we were tested more greatly and performed as exceptionally as we did in this past year. Our colleagues' commitment, professionalism and talent are among the best in the industry, and I could not be prouder of what we've achieved together. In addition, I want to thank our player communities for engaging with our experiences and making our games part of their lives. 
I'll now discuss our recent releases. On April 2, 2K and Visual Concepts once again expanded the breadth and depth of the NBA 2K franchise with the release of NBA 2K21 for Apple Arcade, our first offering for the platform. NBA 2K21 is the most advanced basketball simulation game available on Apple devices, featuring an all-new graphics engine that offers the highest possible resolution, updated rosters and a variety of exciting game modes. NBA 2K21 is currently the most popular game on Apple Arcade. 
On April 7, 2K and HB Studios released the TravisMathew and Puma Golf Gear update for PGA Tour 2K21, which keeps players swinging with swag on the cutting edge of modern golf fashion. The TravisMathew Collection includes new polo shirts, hats and shoes, marking the brand's PGA Tour 2K21 debut, while Puma Golf introduces an all-new oversized hat and new footwear. On April 8, 2K and Gearbox Software continued to enhance the Borderlands franchise with the release of the Directors cut, the sixth add-on for Borderlands 3. 2K and Gearbox will release 2 additional vault cards that will become available for owners of the Directors cut before the end of calendar 2021, and all players can look forward to returning in-game events like Revenge of the Cartels. 
In addition, the teams are continuing to explore cross-play functionality that will enable fans to play Borderlands 3 with their friends across multiple platforms, and we expect to have more to share in the coming months. Anticipation is growing for Lionsgate's full-length live-action film based on Borderlands. The film is directed by Eli Roth and will feature some of Hollywood favorite stars, including Cate Blanchette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Edgar Ramirez. We believe that the film promises to capture the thrills and distinct personality of the series has the potential to introduce new audiences to the beloved world of Borderlands. 
Looking ahead, we are very optimistic about our growth opportunities in fiscal 2022 and beyond. As Strauss mentioned, we have an exciting array of offerings planned for this year, and our long-term development pipeline represents the strongest in Take-Two's history. For fiscal 2022, we have 21 titles planned for release, including 4 immersive core releases for purchase, which include 2 releases from new franchises and 2 titles from existing franchises. 
One new independent title, OlliOlli World from Private Division, which will be available for purchase. 10 free-to-play mobile games, including 6 titles from new franchises and 4 from existing franchises. And 6 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. 
While we are very excited to once again be working with the NFL and NFLPA, our first title under these new partnerships is no longer expected to be released during fiscal year 2022. 2K will have more to share on their plans for our football offerings going forward. 
I'll now discuss details on our announced offerings for this year. Rockstar Games has massive new updates coming this summer to both Red Dead Online and Grand Theft Auto Online and will deliver fans' most heavily requested additions in a host of new items, including quality of life updates. On May 25, Red Dead Online will deliver 8 new races, spanning iconic locations across the game's 5 states. including standard, open, target and open target races. Later this summer, fans can look forward to a host of new missions for skilled outlaws involving everything from quick holdups to larger, high state robberies for big rewards. 
Grand Theft Auto Online continues to expand and evolve. On May 27, Rockstar Games will release 8 new stunt races, which will introduce an array of white-knuckled for racers in an assortment of vehicle classes. Fans of the futuristic Deadline Mode will be happy to have 7 new arenas for combat coming soon. Survival mode will also expand to new locations throughout Los Santos and Blaine County. And later this summer, car culture will return to Los Santos in new ways in Grand Theft Auto Online's next major update, offering fans of performance and customization upgrades, new opportunities to get together and show off their rides. 
This includes a new social space for car meets alongside new races and race types, new vehicles to acquire and a series of new vehicle themed multipart robbery missions. Notably, these major summer updates will continue to deliver additional surprises in the weeks and months after launch including special benefits for players when the enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online arrive on Gen 9 consoles this November 11. 
Rockstar Games will have more details to share about these eagerly anticipated launches in the coming months. This year, we will have 2 sports releases from our popular franchises. 2K and Visual Concepts are once again aiming to raise the bar for excellence with NBA 2K22, the latest offering in our industry-leading basketball simulation series. In addition to making the On-court action even more authentic fans can look forward to new and fun ways to engage with various game modes. Additionally, WWE 2K22 will mark the rebirth of our popular wrestling series. 
During the broadcast of Wrestle Mania 37, 2K and Visual Concepts revealed the very first teaser video for the game, featuring both live action and stunning in-game footage of WWE Superstar Rey Mysterio a high-flying Lucha Libre legend and one of the most exciting and decorated superstars in WWE history. The teaser also highlighted WWE 2K22's tagline, it hits different. which is reflective of both the new direction of the game and its supporting marketing campaign. We're very excited about the team's fresh approach to the series. And last week, our WWE 2K22 development team at Visual Concepts kicked off a social media campaign presently behind the scenes, sneak peeks of the game and developer diary videos. 2K will continue to unveil details in the coming months. 
2K will also introduce 2 releases from new franchises this year, including 1 from Gearbox. On June 24, Private Division will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the release of Kerbal Space Program. Private Division intends to mark the occasion with a week-long celebration, including free content updates and more.

OlliOlli World marks a bold new direction for this critically acclaimed skateboarding franchise and is bursting with personality. Players slip and flow through Radlandia, a vibrant world of full color characters as they search for the mystical Skate God on their quest for Nirvana. 
Radlandia and its dwellers are charming, weird and crafted with a unique art style. Players can enjoy the game's deep combo system and everything it has to offer while pros can really prove their skills and master a vast number of moves with access to millions of unique levels in the game's sandbox mode. 
In addition, players can also compete against similarly skilled rivals around the globe in player leagues. Fiscal 2022 will be a big year for mobile with 10 new free-to-play offerings, including new titles from 2K, Social Point and PlayDots. We'll also have 6 iterations of previous release titles, including enhanced versions of Grand Theft Auto V and the stand-alone version of Grand Theft Auto Online for Gen 9 consoles available for free 3 months for PlayStation 5 players. Both of which will launch in the second half of this calendar year. 
Looking ahead, we expect to deliver over 40 titles across fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, which gives us confidence in our ability to reach new record levels of operating results in the next few years. Our current expected pipeline for fiscal 2023 and '24 includes 19 immersive core releases, 7 of which are sports simulation games. 15 of these will be available for purchase, while 4 will be free-to-play. 5 independent titles, which will all be available for purchase, 10 free-to-play mobile games, 4 mid-core games, which will all be available purchase and 3 of which will be sports oriented and 3 new iterations of previously released titles, which will all be available for purchase. It bears noting that these titles are a snapshot of our current development pipeline. 
It is likely that some of these titles will not be developed through completion or some may be delayed, and we will also be adding new titles to our slate. In the coming months, you'll start to see our titles come to market and we'll aim to share similar updates going forward when we provide our year-end results. In addition to our title releases, we'll also continue to have significant long-term opportunity to increase engagement and recurrent consumer spending. 
Our focus on enhancing our data analytics is enabling us to deepen our understanding of our player base and how they prefer to interact with our games, which is helping us to develop the most desirable products, expansions and new content updates. 
Turning to eSports. The NBA 2K League will kick off its fourth season on May 19 and continue for 16 weeks.

The partnership marks the first of its kind for PlayStation 5 with an eSports league and the first console partnership for the NBA 2K League. We remain very excited about the continued success and growth of the NBA 2K League, which has the long-term potential to enhance engagement and to be a driver of profits for our company.

Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual r",1453,"Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and then review our financial outlook for the full year and first quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note that additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. As Strauss mentioned, our strong momentum continued into the fourth quarter, and we significantly exceeded our net bookings guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'd like to thank our talented colleagues around the world for their passion and dedication, which has been inspiring, especially given the challenges that COVID-19 has presented us with. 
Starting with our fourth quarter results. Total net bookings grew 8% to $785 million as compared to our outlook of $602 million to $652 million. These outstanding results marked our highest level of fourth quarter net bookings on record. During the period, recurrent consumer spending grew 17% and accounted for 67% of total net bookings as compared to our outlook of 5% growth. 
Our outperformance was primarily due to the incredible performance of NBA 2K. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 8% and accounted for 92% of the total. This result exceeded our outlook of a 10% decline due to the outperformance of both recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. During the fourth quarter, 74% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from 63% last year. GAAP net revenue grew 10% to $839 million, while cost of goods sold decreased to $280 million, including a reversal of expense of $65 million related to forfeitures of previously granted stock awards. 
Operating expenses increased to 25% to $304 million, driven by higher marketing, research and development and IT expenses as well as the addition of PlayDots. And GAAP net income grew 78% to $219 million or $1.88 per share as compared to $123 million or $1.07 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Turning to our fiscal 2021 results. Total net bookings grew 19% to a new record of $3.55 billion. This exceeded our initial guidance by approximately $1 billion. We experienced exceptional engagement during the shelter-in-place conditions and delivered extraordinary results across many of our franchises, including NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, Social Point's mobile games and Sid Meier's Civilization. 
Recurrent consumer spending grew 48%, establishing a new record and accounted for 63% of total net bookings. This exceeded our prior outlook of 45% growth. Digitally delivered net bookings grew 27% to a new record of approximately $3.1 billion and accounted for 87% of the total. This also exceeded our prior outlook of 20% growth due to better-than-expected recurrent consumer spending and digitally delivered full game sales. 
During fiscal 2021, 64% of console game sales were delivered digitally, up from the 55% last year. Non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow was $920 million as compared to our previous outlook of over $750 million and marked a record level for our company. During fiscal 2021, we spent $69 million on capital expenditures. 
At fiscal year-end, our cash and short-term investments balance exceeded $2.7 billion. GAAP net revenue grew 9% to $3.37 billion, while cost of goods sold was flat at $1.5 billion. Operating expenses increased by 8% to $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the addition of PlayDots, higher headcount, IT, research and development expense and charitable contributions, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. And GAAP net income grew 46% to $589 million or $5.09 per share. 
Our GAAP net income benefited from a $40.6 million gain on the sale of a long-term investment and a reversal of expense of $70 million related to forfeitures of a previously granted stock award. 
Here we gave our initial outlook for fiscal 2022. We expect net bookings to range from $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion, the second highest level of net bookings in our company's history. This is partly driven by the exciting pipeline of new releases that we have planned for the year with the majority of our titles coming in the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we expect that engagement trends will be notably higher than they were pre-pandemic. However, as the return to normalcy continues, we expect the moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online as well as some of our new releases that are yet to be announced. 
We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 55% 2K, 35% Rockstar Games and 10% Private Division, Social Point and PlayDots. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We expect recurrent consumer spending to decline by 15% as a result of the challenging comparisons from last year. Recurrent consumer spending as a percentage of our business is expected to be approximately 59% versus 63% last year due to more new releases this year. 
We project digitally delivered net bookings to decline by about 8% as a percentage of our business, digital is projected to represent 87%, which is in line with last year. Our forecast assumes that 74% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 64% last year. We expect to generate more than $400 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and we plan to deploy approximately $100 million for capital expenditures. 
The increase in capital expenditures over the prior year is primarily due to continued spending on studio and office build-outs and IT expense to support our investment in talent. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $3.14 billion to $3.24 billion and cost of goods sold to range from $1.41 billion to $1.46 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $1.46 billion to $1.48 billion. 
At the midpoint, this represents a 22% increase over the prior year. As Karl mentioned, we have over 60 titles that we plan to deliver over the next 3 years, and we are making significant investments in key areas such as marketing, personnel and IT to bring our pipeline to market. Additionally, we will have a full year of expenses for PlayDots. While these investments will impact our operating results this year, we are confident that our growing pipeline will enable us to scale our business further and improve our margins in the next few years. 
And we expect GAAP net income to range from $228 million to $257 million or $1.95 to $2.20 per share. For management reporting purposes, we expect our tax rate to be 16% throughout fiscal 2022. 
Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal first quarter. We project net bookings to range from $625 million to $675 million as compared to $996 million in the first quarter last year, which was the first full quarter of the COVID-related shelter-in-place conditions when we experienced a strong initial surge in engagement. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K21, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online and Borderlands 3. 
We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by 30% as we will start to compare against the record levels of engagement that we experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We also expect digitally delivered net bookings to decline by approximately 30%. Our forecast assumes that 80% of console game sales will be delivered digitally, up from 71% in the same period last year. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $730 million to $780 million and cost of goods sold to range from $277 million to $303 million. 
Operating expenses are expected to range from $316 million to $326 million. At the midpoint, this represents an 18% increase over last year, driven primarily by higher personnel and stock compensation expenses and the inclusion of PlayDots. And GAAP net income is expected to range from $116 million to $129 million or $1 to $1.10 per share. 
In closing, fiscal 2021 was a record year for our business, and we believe that we can exceed these levels of financial results and establish new record levels of performance in the coming years. Our pipeline is robust, and we couldn't be more excited about our new releases for fiscal 2022 and beyond. As we continue to enhance our business by investing in talent, including growing our development headcount and building our infrastructure, we are positioning our company for long-term growth and success. and we expect to deliver sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss."

There's an awful lot of interesting things going on in the world of user-generated content, and there have been for some time. And we're open-minded, and we want to support the community.

The rub is to find a way to engage consumers on the one hand and enable them to express their interest and even their creative desires in the context of our properties. And there are numerous ways to go about that. And I believe we will explore many of those ways, again, in the context of protecting our intellectual property. 
With regards to Grand Theft Auto, it may shock you to learn that I'm probably not going to comment much on content to come from Rockstar Games. We're so grateful for the extraordinary results that we've had with all Rockstar titles. And in fact, all titles coming from throughout the organization. Grand Theft Auto Online set another record past fiscal year. We sold in over 145 million units. We're very optimistic about what there is to come, including more content. And stay tuned because Rockstar Games will be talking more about that in the future."

But we do think it's a long-term franchise, and it is certainly something that we're pleased with the results. 
In terms of Private Division, we really couldn't be more pleased with the way Private Division is going. As Strauss said, we've already had 3 titles that have sold in excess of 1 million units each, which is unusual for independent releases. We have a lot of titles in process. We've got one coming up this year with OlliOlli World. There are a lot of other deals in the pipeline. We've talked about some of them, most of them we have not talked about yet, and they're varied. There are different scales, different sizes, different shapes, different kinds of experiences, which make makes them very exciting. That team is growing, not only from a creative talent perspective in support of Kerbal Space Program, but also from a marketing and publishing perspective. So we expect the best is yet to come from Private Division, and we love how we're positioned right now."

In terms of how we're doing despite the pandemic, look, the team has just performed so well. We were very fortunate. Our IT group had us fully prepared for a disaster, and we could never predict the pandemic, but a week after we had to start working from home, we were all set up remotely, and we were highly productive, and we stayed highly productive ever since. 
We had virtually no slippage. The only title that actually moved as a result of the pandemic was Kerbal Space Program 2, which moved out of this fiscal year, and we're super excited about that title and it will be coming. The rest of our production stayed on target and the quality has been amazing as you've seen in our results. We are highly confident in our pipeline going forward. As Karl said, though, the price that we pay for being as transparent about our future pipeline is that certain things will change. We hope that certain things will change to the good, certain things may also disappoint us. At this point in time, we feel very good about the way our production is unfolding and we don't see any concerns on the horizon. 
With regard to M&A, our strategy remains the same. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to do everything from modest add-on acquisitions. For example, we acquired HB Studios. 2 more substantial acquisitions such as the acquisition of PlayDots last calendar year. And prior to that, the acquisition of Social Point. There's no secret in that we wish to bulk up our mobile offerings. We're certainly trying to do that organically. We have many titles coming from mobile from Social Point and PlayDots and 2K. And at the same time, we're open-minded with regard to acquisitions. 
Our lens is pretty disciplined. And the result of that disciplined lens is that in 14 years, we haven't had 1 failed acquisition. I'm sure we've also missed some opportunities by being overly disciplined. But on balance, it's worked out well for us. Our capital is used for 3 purposes: returning capital to our shareholders, which we've aggressively done over many years, although opportunistically, supporting organic growth, which is our story around here, and allowing us to pursue inorganic growth opportunities on a selective and disciplined basis. And I think that will continue to be the case. 
Finally, with regard to console shortages, there's no doubt that supply chains were disrupted in the pandemic. They still remain disruptive. There is a chip shortage. But it's sort of a good news, bad news thing. The bad news, I suppose, is that you can't get a console for lower money. The good news is that people really want these new consoles. We had a limited selection of releases for Next Gen NBA 2K21, which is built from the ground up for Next Gen and Borderlands III. We have obviously many more titles coming in the future. We think the supply shortages will be resolved and consumers would be able to buy their dream console. So over time, we're not worried about it, and it didn't really hurt us short term either."

We also have a lot of marketing around our mobile titles. So we have a big portfolio of mobile titles as well and mobile titles coming out. So that's also been driving our marketing spend as well."

I'm always allergic to buzzwords. The buzzword of virtual reality didn't get this industry very far. AR hasn't really improved matters either, 3D hasn't really done much for us. What moves the dial in our business is amazing creativity great characters, great stories, great graphics, great gameplay, the ability to enjoy those experiences with other people all around the world. That's what really matters. 
I think what the metaverse implies is what we already do with Grand Theft Auto Online and with what Red Dead Online, what we do with NBA 2K and what we aim to do with some upcoming titles, an opportunity to exist in that fictional world and express yourself in ways that are challenging, fun, competitive and new and find ourselves in places doing things that we can't really do usually in the real world. I think that's what it means. 
I think when you get into conversations around -- are people going to do conference calls in titles? Well, the answer is they can now. But who -- were not do, like we could, I guess, do this conference call inside 1 of our titles, but it's a bit more efficient to do it this way. So the problem I have is that if you sort of take metaverse, SPAC and cryptocurrency, put them all together. In 5 years, will any of this matter? I'm not sure it will."

But I do think, like I mentioned before, our analytics capabilities are getting much more sophisticated. And not to mention, we do have -- we have a lot of modes in our NBA game. And we have different ways for people to engage and therefore, we have different ways for it to monetize in those modes.
And just getting people to play, people more deeply engage in the game and play across those modes, there's a lot of opportunity right there in and of itself. So we're not just stuck to 1 type of monetization for card packs, et cetera, like that. We've got a lot of other opportunities.

Of course, I can't opine specifically on that action because I don't have any particular insight. 
However, between regulatory authorities, investigations and private concerns, Clearly, take rates are being examined. But at the end of the day, it's the economy that governs, and we are in a broadly competitive distribution environment. And the goal of this organization has always been and remains, be where the consumer is, which means we'll employ a broad array of distribution platforms, including our own direct-to-consumer platform. And what that means over time is it's going to be hard to have a take rate for distributors that is economically too high. That leads to an unstable system. And that's what you're seeing now, in my opinion. 
I think this will be resolved relatively soon, and it will be resolved in a favorable way. And I think that take rates will decline meaningfully, and that will, of course, benefit us.
