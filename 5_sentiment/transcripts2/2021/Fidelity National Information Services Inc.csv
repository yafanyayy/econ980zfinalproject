I'm pleased to announce our fourth quarter and full year results, starting on Slide 5. 2020 was an unprecedented year for the world and for FIS, with the COVID-19 pandemic impact in the world on",1406,"Thank you, Nate. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to announce our fourth quarter and full year results, starting on Slide 5. 2020 was an unprecedented year for the world and for FIS, with the COVID-19 pandemic impact in the world on a human as well as an economic level. 
Despite the extraordinary year, we leveraged our scale and resources to keep the global economy running while delivering solid results. We generated $12.6 billion in revenue as our balanced solution portfolio allowed us to offset weaker consumer spending trends with strong demand for our banking and capital market solutions. As we close out 2020, all 3 of our business segments ended the year with record annual sales, continuing to prove that our solutions and technologies are winning share around the globe. Our backlog grew 7% organically to $22 billion. This gives us exceptional visibility into our future growth trajectory and drives our confidence in accelerating organic revenue growth for our banking and capital market segments. From a Merchant perspective, given the accelerating rollout of COVID vaccines globally and improving trends in economic indicators, we are confident we will see strong Merchant revenue acceleration throughout 2021. Our team continues to execute at the highest levels, demonstrated by our ability to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 120 basis points for the full year despite near-term COVID challenges. We also made great progress with the Worldpay integration, remaining well ahead of plan and exited the year generating more than $200 million in revenue synergies and more than $750 million in cost synergies in cost synergies. With this impressive momentum, we are excited to build on our strengths as we look ahead to accelerating organic revenue growth in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 6. FIS had a very successful year operating the business, and I couldn't be prouder of the team's accomplishments and unwavering commitment to support our clients and communities. The modernization and innovation investments we've made are paying dividends, enabling us to accelerate organic growth across our entire business. Amazon, a long-term Merchant client added our capital markets industry-leading treasury management system to the growing portfolio of services that we provide them. 
Further, Walgreens and Giant Eagle expanded their long-standing relationships with FIS. Walgreens selected our integrated payables solution and Giant Eagle selected a series of our back office financial solutions from our comprehensive banking suite. We also recently developed an innovative benefits card solution with UnitedHealth group that combines strengths from across FIS. In this partnership, we created a fully in-house solution where we accept transactions as the merchant processor, route them through our network and finish with our own authorization and settlement engine. 
2020 highlighted how our unique capabilities are being successfully combined to serve our clients in ways that they can't find anywhere else. We continue to invest in cutting-edge technologies for the future, including contactless, voice-enabled and self-service solutions as well as AI and automation. We launched over 60 new products in 2020 with a focus on enabling our clients to grow their revenues and operate more efficiently. All of this enables FIS to emerge from the pandemic and an even stronger competitive position. We also continue to be relentlessly focused on improving our own operational efficiencies. We made exceptional progress in integrating Worldpay as well as consolidating platforms and data centers with over 70% of our global compute now running in the cloud. 
To continue our upward margin momentum, we are beginning the next phase of our enterprise transformation. We will leverage data analytics and automation to reduce our cost and create new efficiencies by upgrading and consolidating our technology platforms as well as continuing to simplify our technology architecture. As a result, FIS will be faster, more agile and deliver frictionless service by transforming our operating model in streamlining our organization. 
Given the tremendous achievements from our data center consolidation program and ongoing cost synergies, I am confident in our ability to deliver 45% adjusted EBITDA margins this year and then continue to expand them in each year for the foreseeable future. 
From a market viewpoint, demand continues to increase. Both our sales pipeline and backlog continue to grow, and we are finding new sources of revenue synergies and cross-sell wins to accelerate our business further. 
Turning to Slide 7. In Banking Solutions, we continue to win share and accelerate revenue growth. Our investments have enabled us to build a differentiated offering, winning new logos across markets of all sizes and actively expanding wallet share with existing clients. As a result, our backlog within the banking business expanded by 8% organically and generated $3.5 billion in new sales during 2020, which is our largest selling year ever, cross-selling of new solutions into our existing client base is also up, including a 23% increase in cross-selling solutions to our top 100 clients. 
In addition, 3 of our recent Modern Banking Platform wins are now live. And we project that the Modern Banking Platform will generate in excess of $100 million of revenue in 2021. We expanded our relationship with Bank of Hawaii to power their digital banking product offering. They will implement our Digital One solution to bring modern, best-in-class capabilities to both self-service and banker assisted channels. 
Lastly, U.S. Bank, a top 5 bank selected our bill pay solution due to our simple integration and personalization across digital channels. Our multiyear sales success, strong revenue backlog, continued strength in the pipeline and ability to consistently drive innovation into the market, lay out a clear path for banking to accelerate revenue growth in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 8. In Merchant, we will leverage our technology advantage and leading competitive position to continue to win share, all while taking advantage of the revenue tailwind being presented by recovering economic and pandemic indicators. We continue to outpace the industry regarding total volumes being processed indicating not only the overall strength of our capabilities, but our continued ability to gain share throughout the pandemic. 
We are also seizing the opportunity created by the rapid shift to consumer spending to online and digital channels, where our e-commerce volume, excluding travel and airlines, grew 32%. We provide advanced and highly differentiated omnichannel capabilities, including buy online and pickup or return in store, which merchants must have to compete in the digital economy. Our expanded relationship with Walmart to process e-commerce transactions is a great example, and we are also winning new business with innovative online providers like Grubhub. 
Norton Lifelock also selected FIS to provide global e-commerce acquiring using our innovative access Worldpay Gateway, which the Strawhecker Group just recognized for having the highest authorization rates in the industry. Looking forward, our global reach, tailored solutions and innovative technology will continue to drive share gains for us as changing merchant and consumer behaviors play to our strengths. 
Moving to Slide 9. Demand is strong for our end-to-end, front, middle and back office solutions within capital markets and our leading regulatory compliance technology. We continue to gain traction with our SaaS-based delivery model, which drove a 7% increase in new sales for reoccurring revenue in 2021, including a 19% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, new logos contributed to 26% of our fourth quarter new sales. And average deal size grew 9% as we continue to add to our portfolio of leading buy side and sell-side clients. All of these are strong indicators for accelerating growth in 2021. 
A few sales highlights include BNP Paribas, who recently chose to expand our relationship. We will transform their post-trade derivatives clearing platform, which will allow them to benefit from significant cost and operational efficiencies as well as enhance customer service, all while reducing risk. We also signed an agreement with Allianz, a large global insurance company, to provide payment and cash processing platforms. 
On the buy side, Vanguard recently expanded their relationship with us to include outsourced tax reporting, highlighting one of our leading RegTech solutions. Our differentiated end-to-end solutions are winning share, and our transition to recurring SaaS-based revenue streams is also taking hold, which gives us confidence in our ability to further accelerate this business. 
I'd like to underscore that we are pleased with our full year 2020 results across all of our business segments. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2021 and beyond. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter as well as forward guidance. Woody?"

Starting on Slide 11, I will touch on our fourth quarter results before transitioning to our forward guidance. We remain excited about the trajectory of our banking and capital market segments, and look forward to significantly rebounding growth in our merchant segment as global economies reopen. On a consolidated basis, organic growth was flat during the fourth quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 60 basis points to generate adjusted EPS of $1.62. We expect to exit 2021 generating $400 million of run rate revenue synergies based on strong client demand for our Premium Payback solution, growing distribution with new bank referral partners as well as geographic expansion and cross-sell initiatives across the enterprise. 
These revenue synergies will help supplement our organic revenue growth profile, giving us increased confidence in achieving 7% to 9% organic revenue growth on a sustained basis. We also have line of sight to execute an additional $100 million of operating cost synergies, bringing that total to $500 million exiting 2021, or 125% of the original OpEx target. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 12. In banking, organic revenue growth accelerated to 5%, and strong execution more than offset lower termination fees. Based on our large and growing backlog as well as our growing pipeline of new opportunities, we continue to expect the banking segment to accelerate into the mid- to high single digits. 
Our Merchant segment revenue declined 9% organically or 7% on a normalized basis when excluding the step-up in debit routing synergy that we achieved following the Worldpay acquisition. As we begin to lap the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter, we expect Merchant revenue growth to rebound sharply, driving mid- to high teens growth for 2021. 
Our capital markets segment continues to exceed expectations, with organic growth of 3% in the quarter, which includes about 1 point of headwind associated with the timing of license renewals. This segment is positioned for low to mid single-digit organic growth in 2021 driven by another strong year of new sales and recurring revenue growth. 
On Slide 13, we provide more detail about how client mix is affecting Merchant revenue growth during the pandemic. The significant difference in consumer spending trends between discretionary and nondiscretionary verticals is creating an unusual revenue mix headwind for us. Discretionary spending verticals, which typically carry higher yields, experienced a sharp contraction during the pandemic. Meanwhile, nondiscretionary verticals and most of e-comm typically comprise of lower priced, large enterprise and multinational clients experienced strong demand. 
As a result, Merchant revenue declined even as volume continued to grow. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect these mixed headwinds on yield to reverse as discretionary verticals rebound over easy comps. This should create a significant yield tailwind for our Merchant revenue growth that extends until these verticals were bound fully. 
Turning to Slide 14. I want to touch on the strength of our balance sheet, cash flow and liquidity position. We generated over $3 billion of free cash flow in 2020, which was up about 50% over last year. We invest over $1 billion in CapEx in order to drive new technology and solutions to the market. We made the strategic decision to maintain our capital expenditure budget through the pandemic as others were forced to retrench in order to continue to accelerate our new sales and competitive momentum relative to our peers. Even as we continue to invest in innovation and growth, our liquidity position continues to grow and reached $4.6 billion by the end of the fourth quarter, which is up by about $400 million sequentially. 
Looking forward, we expect free cash flow conversion to continue to improve, up from 24% of revenue in 2020, increasing to 25% to 27% of revenue in 2021 as we continue to drive integration and efficiency throughout the business. 
Turning to Slide 15. I want to touch on our capital allocation priorities in light of the large share repurchase authorization and simultaneous dividend increase that we recently announced. Over the long term, organic growth and M&A opportunities have been and will continue to be our first priority for long-term success. We will invest aggressively in our fastest-growing businesses and target high-growth assets for M&A to accelerate or extend our growth profile. If it fits our overall strategy, drives accelerating growth for our company and is actionable, we will execute accordingly. 
Next, share repurchase will continue to be our primary tool for returning excess free cash flow along with a consistent 10% to 15% dividend increase each year. In the short term, we believe that FIS shares are trading well below their intrinsic value, creating an opportune time to buy back stock. We recently announced Board approval to buy back 100 million shares, which represents approximately 16% of our shares outstanding or over $13 billion at current stock price. 
The Board's decision to approve this program reflects continued confidence in the strength of our financial position and the durability of our business model. There is no time limit on this authorization, and we expect to begin buying stock as soon as we can. 
I'd like to begin our discussion of '21 guidance with a view into our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations on Slide 16. We expect to achieve 250 to 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in '21. The biggest driver of this will be high incremental margins as revenue growth accelerates. We anticipate approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion associated with our ongoing achievement of operating expense synergies. Unwinding our COVID-related short-term cost actions will create approximately 150 basis points of headwind in 2021 as these costs come back on line. We continue to anticipate meaningful margin expansion beyond 2021, supported by our one-to-many operating model and ongoing efficiencies as we continue to optimize our infrastructure. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 17. In the first quarter, we expect organic growth of 1% to 2%, generating revenues of $3.13 billion to $3.16 billion. Once we lap the COVID pandemic comps in late Q1, we expect revenue growth to accelerate materially, beginning with the second quarter and driving us to our full year expectations. We expect to generate $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion of adjusted EBITDA for a margin of approximately 40% to 40.5% as we begin to fund our bonus pool. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.25 for the quarter. For the full year, we anticipate revenue of $13.5 billion to $13.7 billion. This represents 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, which is higher than the 7% to 9% range that we initially expected, reflecting our increased confidence as Gary described. Further, we expect to generate $6 billion to $6.15 billion of adjusted EBITDA for a margin of approximately 45%. 
As a result of our accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins, we expect adjusted EPS to grow $0.14 to $0.17 to a range of $6.20 to $6.40. Finally, we provide some additional guidance assumptions in the appendix material. 
As we enter 2021, I'm excited about our accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow generation. I believe we are uniquely positioned as a sustained higher growth large-cap stock, and we'll be able to drive consistent long-term shareholder value.

We're very confident in the accelerating growth in the banking channel. It's clear when you look at the backlog, you've seen acceleration over the last several quarters, which is a testament to the sales engine, closing of business. So now as we enter into this year, it's really all about implementing that backlog, getting it stood up. I thought it was important to let everybody know that, for example, the Modern Banking Platform, we had 3 deals already go live this year, which is a good testament of that platform. It's now in market, processing. Obviously, we've got a lot of sales behind that, that are in the implementation cycle and continue to progress. But we feel good about where we are. We're not -- it's hard to predict termination fees at this point, but we see no indications that we're going to have challenges with termination fees or growing over a termination fee. So I think it's just going to be good execution on behalf of banking through the implementation channel. Obviously, we want to continue to have our sales engine, continue to add to that backlog so that growth acceleration maintains going into 2022, but we feel good about 2021."

Large transformational M&A, where we think we're extremely good at integrating those kind of companies. You see the success rate we've had now with well over $740 million of cost out of Worldpay, and over $200 million in revenue at this point. So we think there's a way to drive scale and drive complements to that. 
As we think about it, our aperture can be pretty wide. Our diversification of revenue is an important differentiator for us. You've seen us actually do very well against our peer group in the middle of a COVID -- in the middle of the pandemic, which is all due to that diversification of revenue. So opening our aperture and looking for things that maybe could drive those kind of benefits I just described would be important. But we also -- to Bruce's point earlier, given our investment in innovation, given our investment in technology, our ability to launch new product and capability, we don't have to do M&A to continue to grow.

Or Gary, maybe it was you earlier that you'd expand margins in years after. Is it back to that 50 to 100 basis points type model of margin expansion going forward?

We have a really unique opportunity to now start consolidating our platforms and getting significant cost down. So we're very confident in continuing to accelerate that 50 and 100 bps beyond this year, all while maintaining what we would view is really industry-leading investment back in innovation and growth.

Something that feels of our gap in our capability brings the necessary scale that we would need in a particular area that we're focused on. I think that can be translated into whether it's tuck-in or large transformational M&A. I also would tell you, we also have been pretty disciplined in our approach over the years, right? So this is not a company that has to do M&A in order to continue to grow and accelerate. And you see that with our guide. When we did the Worldpay combination, we guided to 7% to 9% growth. And this year, we're going to be in that range. And obviously, we feel comfortable we can maintain in that range going even into 2022 and beyond with margin expansion based on the things we've talked about. 
So we'll continue to look at things that make sense for the company. Things that drive scale, things that fill in product, things that we see some markets moving in a direction where we think doing some type of M&A activity will be faster in us building it ourselves, all of that will be taken into consideration and making sure that it drives the appropriate shareholder returns."

We anticipate significant growth, particularly in Merchant in Q2 as we lap COVID impacts. We anticipate the mix to flip the other way, as we've talked about before, when we see volumes coming back in the discretionary areas and in travel and airlines to improve. We certainly do not have travel and airlines at the same pre-COVID levels throughout 2021. We think it will take into 2022 before that actually comes back 100%, but certainly see outsized growth expectations in Merchant in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 of 2021. 
The remainder of the business -- banking, again, we anticipate acceleration off of Q4 into Q1 and then continue to see good solid growth in each quarter. And then capital markets, we anticipate actually to accelerate over the course of the year with a difficult comp in the first quarter and then second and third quarter to move on. If you think about the cadence of EPS for the year, as we've outlined, the information around Q1 versus consensus estimates, obviously, we think consensus estimates are a little too high for Q1. We think Q2 and Q3 are roughly in line, and Q3 is a little low to give you sort of the full cadence of the year -- for Q4, a little low. So that's a little bit there. MVP, we have converted 3 customers that are live now, and we do anticipate it to drive $100 million of revenue in 2021, and we continue to work through the conversions of additional sales that we made throughout 2020."

If you remember, we saw yields in the second quarter, move away from volumes, we saw those come back some in the third quarter as economy reopened. And then as you saw, lockdowns go back in place in fourth quarter, we saw yields diverge again.

I would tell you that our confidence level is really in banking, in the backlog around banking and seeing it accelerate. We've moved that up to mid- to high single digits. You saw 5% in Q4. We anticipate that to accelerate into Q1. So I think that moving in the mid- to high single digits is a good bit of the confidence. Previously, too, we have talked about cap markets in the low single digits. We've actually kind of moved that up slightly into low to mid-single digits. So we anticipate cap markets to see better growth than historical this year as well. So I think those are the 2 biggest items that have kind of moved our confidence level up from the 7% to 9% to the 8% to 9%, specific '21 guide versus outsized Merchant. Merchant, we just anticipate mid- to upper teens. And it could be higher than that, if we see rebounds faster.

If you look at our investment, what he highlighted almost $1 billion of capital a year, keep in mind, that is us driving 60 new products in market, Modern Banking Platform, retooling our Payments One initiatives, Digital one, a cloud-native omnichannel platform on deployment as well as all the things we're doing in capital markets and merchant. With our access Worldpay gateway and others and also NAP conversion. So we -- I think we're balancing it very well. And we're doing that because these new technologies not only allow you to compete on the revenue front, they should and will drive cost out, right? If you start driving true AI into your organization, you're going to eliminate costs. There's no way around it. If you automate, you're going to eliminate costs. And so our balance that we've done over the last several years, as we went through the cloud migration, that's now complete. We're doing the exact same thing with our platform rationalization as well as the exact same thing with new product launches, all while balancing. But we think we're in a really good position with about 8% of our revenue being deployed back into capital. Keep in mind also, as Woody talked about our free cash flow converting. We will have our debt completely reloaded by the end of this year, no sense paying our debt structure down faster. So that will even give us additional capital to deploy across that strategy, whether it's increasing share buybacks, whether it's increasing M&A or whether it's increasing new product capabilities to continue to drive our organic revenue growth in those upper single digits and then moving from there."

In this same time period, dominated by daily challenges of the virus, we stretched ourselves to evolve to think and deliver differently. At FIS, we took these challenges head on, and I firmly believe that we are a stronger, more resilient company from where we were a year ago. As the backbone to the global financial ecosystem, we ensure that transactions and accounts continue to be processed 24/7 while we reimagined our system implementation processes, enabling us to implement systems in a 100% virtual environment. We rapidly implemented a real-time lending platform for our financial institution clients. Streamlining and speeding the processing of more than 225,000 PPP-approved loan under the CARES Act. 
So far in 2021, we've expanded our reach and successfully processed nearly $8 billion of PPP loan applications for more than 68,000 U.S. merchants and small businesses. We also manage the rollout and distribution of expanded EBT benefits under SNAP in 28 U.S. states and territories, helping over 10 million children. Just as important, we double down on our commitments to support our communities by executing global giveback programs to [indiscernible] PP&E equipment and prepaid cards to support our frontline health care workers. We also recognize our responsibility to push for sustained social change, both domestically and globally. As you have heard us mention before, increasing inclusion and diversity, financial inclusion and climate change initiatives are important goals for all of us at FIS. Building an environment that enables our colleagues, clients and communities to thrive, demonstrates how we are leveraging our technology and innovation at scale to create lasting change that benefits everyone.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to announce our fourth quarter and full year results, starting on Slide 5. 2020 was an unprecedented year for the world and for FIS with the COVID-19 pandemic impact in the world on a human as well as an economic level. Despite the extraordinary year, we leveraged our scale and resources to keep the global economy running while delivering solid results. We generated $12.6 billion in revenue as our balanced solution portfolio allowed us to offset weaker consumer spending trends with strong demand for our banking and capital market solutions. 
As we closed out 2020, all 3 of our business segments ended the year with record annual sales, continuing to prove that our solutions and technologies are winning share around the globe. Our backlog grew 7% organically to $22 billion. This gives us exceptional visibility into our future growth trajectory and drives our confidence in accelerating organic revenue growth for our banking and capital market segments. 
From a Merchant perspective, given the accelerating rollout of COVID vaccines globally and improving trends in economic indicators, we are confident we will see strong Merchant revenue acceleration throughout 2021. Our team continues to execute at the highest levels, demonstrated by our ability to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 120 basis points for the full year despite near-term COVID challenges. 
We also made great progress with the Worldpay integration, remaining well ahead of plan and exited the year generating more than $200 million in revenue synergies and more than $750 million in cost synergies. With this impressive momentum, we are excited to build on our strengths as we look ahead to accelerating organic revenue growth in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 6. FIS had a very successful year operating the business, and I couldn't be prouder of the team's accomplishments and unwavering commitment to support our clients and communities. The modernization and innovation investments we've made are paying dividends, enabling us to accelerate organic growth across our entire business. 
Amazon, a long-term Merchant client added our Capital Markets industry-leading treasury management system to the growing portfolio of services that we provide them. Further, Walgreens and Giant Eagle expanded their long-standing relationships with FIS. Walgreens selected our integrated payables solution and Giant Eagle selected a series of our back office financial solutions from our comprehensive banking suite. We also recently developed an innovative benefits card solution with UnitedHealth Group that combines strengths from across FIS. In this partnership, we created a fully in-house solution where we accept transactions as the merchant processor, route them through our network and finish with our own authorization and settlement engine. 2020 highlighted how our unique capabilities are being successfully combined to serve our clients in ways that they can't find anywhere else. 
We continue to invest in cutting-edge technologies for the future, including contactless, voice-enabled and self-service solutions as well as AI and automation. We launched over 60 new products in 2020 with a focus on enabling our clients to grow their revenues and operate more efficiently. All of this enables FIS to emerge from the pandemic in an even stronger competitive position. We also continue to be relentlessly focused on improving our own operational efficiencies. We made exceptional progress in integrating Worldpay as well as consolidating platforms and data centers, with over 70% of our global compute now running in the cloud. 
To continue our upward margin momentum, we are beginning the next phase of our enterprise transformation. We will leverage data analytics and automation to reduce our cost and create new efficiencies by upgrading and consolidating our technology platforms as well as continuing to simplify our technology architecture. As a result, FIS will be faster, more agile and deliver frictionless service by transforming our operating model and streamlining our organization. Given the tremendous achievements from our data center consolidation program and ongoing cost synergies, I am confident in our ability to deliver 45% adjusted EBITDA margins this year and then continue to expand them in each year for the foreseeable future. 
From a market viewpoint, demand continues to increase. Both our sales pipeline and backlog continue to grow, and we are finding new sources of revenue synergies and cross-sell wins to accelerate our business further. 
Turning to Slide 7. In Banking Solutions, we continue to win share and accelerate revenue growth. Our investments have enabled us to build a differentiated offering, winning new logos across markets of all sizes and actively expanding wallet share with existing clients. As a result, our backlog within the Banking business expanded by 8% organically and generated $3.5 billion in new sales during 2020, which is our largest selling year ever. Cross-selling of new solutions into our existing client base is also up, including a 23% increase in cross-selling solutions to our top 100 clients. 
In addition, 3 of our recent Modern Banking Platform wins are now live, and we project that the Modern Banking Platform will generate in excess of $100 million of revenue in 2021. We expanded our relationship with Bank of Hawaii to power their digital banking product offering. They will implement our Digital One solution to bring modern, best-in-class capabilities to both self-service and banker-assisted channels. Lastly, U.S. Bank, a top 5 bank, selected our bill pay solution due to our simple integration and personalization across digital channels. Our multiyear sales success, strong revenue backlog, continued strength in the pipeline and ability to consistently drive innovation into the market lay out a clear path for Banking to accelerate revenue growth in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 8. In Merchant, we will leverage our technology advantage and leading competitive position to continue to win share, all while taking advantage of the revenue tailwind being presented by recovering economic and pandemic indicators. We continue to outpace the industry regarding total volumes being processed, indicating not only the overall strength of our capabilities but our continued ability to gain share throughout the pandemic. 
We are also seizing the opportunity created by the rapid shift to consumer spending to online and digital channels where our e-commerce volume, excluding travel and airlines, grew 32%. We provide advanced and highly differentiated omnichannel capabilities, including buy online and pick up or return in store, which merchants must have to compete in the digital economy. Our expanded relationship with Walmart to process e-commerce transactions is a great example, and we are also winning new business with innovative online providers, like Grubhub. NortonLifeLock also selected FIS to provide global e-commerce acquiring -- using our innovative Access Worldpay gateway, which The Strawhecker Group just recognized for having the highest authorization rates in the industry. Looking forward, our global reach, tailored solutions and innovative technology will continue to drive share gains for us as changing merchant and consumer behaviors play to our strengths. 
Moving to Slide 9. Demand is strong for our end-to-end, front, middle and back office solutions within capital markets and our leading regulatory compliance technology. We continue to gain traction with our SaaS-based delivery model, which drove a 7% increase in new sales for reoccurring revenue in 2021, including a 19% increase in the fourth quarter. In addition, new logos contributed to 26% of our fourth quarter new sales, and average deal size grew 9% as we continue to add to our portfolio of leading buy-side and sell-side clients. All of these are strong indicators for accelerating growth in 2021. 
A few sales highlights include BNP Paribas, who recently chose to expand our relationship. We will transform their post-trade derivatives clearing platform, which will allow them to benefit from significant cost and operational efficiencies as well as enhance customer service, all while reducing risk. We also signed an agreement with Allianz, a large global insurance company, to provide payment and cash processing platforms. 
On the buy side, Vanguard recently expanded their relationship with us to include outsourced tax reporting, highlighting one of our leading RegTech solutions. Our differentiated end-to-end solutions are winning share, and our transition to recurring SaaS-based revenue streams is also taking hold, which gives us confidence in our ability to further accelerate this business. 
I'd like to underscore that we are pleased with our full year 2020 results across all of our business segments. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2021 and beyond. 
Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter as well as forward guidance. Woody?"

Starting on Slide 11, I will touch on our fourth quarter results before transitioning to our forward guidance. We remain excited about the trajectory of our Banking and Capital Market segments and look forward to significantly rebounding growth in our Merchant segment as global economies reopen. 
On a consolidated basis, organic growth was flat during the fourth quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 60 basis points to generate adjusted EPS of $1.62. We expect to exit 2021 generating $400 million of run rate revenue synergies based on strong client demand for our Premium Payback solution, growing distribution with new bank referral partners as well as geographic expansion and cross-sell initiatives across the enterprise. These revenue synergies will help supplement our organic revenue growth profile, giving us increased confidence in achieving 7% to 9% organic revenue growth on a sustained basis. We also have line of sight to execute an additional $100 million of operating cost synergies, bringing that total to $500 million exiting 2021 or 125% of the original OpEx target. 
Turning to segment results on Slide 12. In Banking, organic revenue growth accelerated to 5%, and strong execution more than offset lower termination fees. Based on our large and growing backlog as well as our growing pipeline of new opportunities, we continue to expect the Banking segment to accelerate into the mid- to high single digits. 
Our Merchant segment revenue declined 9% organically or 7% on a normalized basis when excluding the step-up in debit routing synergy that we achieved following the Worldpay acquisition. As we begin to lap the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter, we expect Merchant revenue growth to rebound sharply, driving mid- to high teens growth for 2021. 
Our Capital Markets segment continues to exceed expectations with organic growth of 3% in the quarter, which includes about 1 point of headwind associated with the timing of license renewals. This segment is positioned for low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2021 driven by another strong year of new sales and recurring revenue growth. 
On Slide 13, we provide more detail about how client mix is affecting Merchant revenue growth during the pandemic. The significant difference in consumer spending trends between discretionary and nondiscretionary verticals is creating an unusual revenue mix headwind for us. Discretionary spending verticals, which typically carry higher yields, experienced a sharp contraction during the pandemic. Meanwhile, nondiscretionary verticals and most of e-comm, typically comprised of lower-priced, large enterprise and multinational clients, experienced strong demand. As a result, Merchant revenue declined even as volume continued to grow. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect these mixed headwinds on yield to reverse as discretionary verticals rebound over easy comps. This should create a significant yield tailwind for our Merchant revenue growth that extends until these verticals rebound fully. 
Turning to Slide 14, I want to touch on the strength of our balance sheet, cash flow and liquidity position. We generated over $3 billion of free cash flow in 2020, which was up about 50% over last year. We invested over $1 billion in CapEx in order to drive new technology and solutions to the market. We made the strategic decision to maintain our capital expenditure budget through the pandemic, as others were forced to retrench, in order to continue to accelerate our new sales and competitive momentum relative to our peers. Even as we continue to invest in innovation and growth, our liquidity position continues to grow and reached $4.6 billion by the end of the fourth quarter, which is up by about $400 million sequentially. Looking forward, we expect free cash flow conversion to continue to improve, up from 24% of revenue in 2020, increasing to 25% to 27% of revenue in 2021 as we continue to drive integration and efficiency throughout the business. 
Turning to Slide 15, I want to touch on our capital allocation priorities in light of the large share repurchase authorization and simultaneous dividend increase that we recently announced. Over the long term, organic growth and M&A opportunities have been and will continue to be our first priority for long-term success. We will invest aggressively in our fastest-growing businesses and target high-growth assets for M&A to accelerate or extend our growth profile. If it fits our overall strategy, drives accelerating growth for our company and is actionable, we will execute accordingly. 
Next, share repurchase will continue to be our primary tool for returning excess free cash flow along with a consistent 10% to 15% dividend increase each year. In the short term, we believe that FIS shares are trading well below their intrinsic value, creating an opportune time to buy back stock. We recently announced Board approval to buy back 100 million shares, which represents approximately 16% of our shares outstanding or over $13 billion at current stock price. The Board's decision to approve this program reflects continued confidence in the strength of our financial position and the durability of our business model. There is no time limit on this authorization, and we expect to begin buying stock as soon as we can. 
I'd like to begin our discussion of '21 guidance with a view into our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations on Slide 16. We expect to achieve 250 to 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in '21. The biggest driver of this will be high incremental margins as revenue growth accelerates. We anticipate approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion associated with our ongoing achievement of operating expense synergies. Unwinding our COVID-related short-term cost actions will create approximately 150 basis points of headwind in 2021 as these costs come back online. We continue to anticipate meaningful margin expansion beyond 2021, supported by our one-to-many operating model and ongoing efficiencies as we continue to optimize our infrastructure. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 17. In the first quarter, we expect organic growth of 1% to 2%, generating revenues of $3.13 billion to $3.16 billion. Once we lap the COVID pandemic comps in late Q1, we expect revenue growth to accelerate materially beginning with the second quarter and driving us to our full year expectations. We expect to generate $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion of adjusted EBITDA for a margin of approximately 40% to 40.5% as we begin to fund our bonus pool. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.25 for the quarter. 
For the full year, we anticipate revenue of $13.5 billion to $13.7 billion. This represents 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, which is higher than the 7% to 9% range that we initially expected, reflecting our increased confidence, as Gary described. Further, we expect to generate $6 billion to $6.15 billion of adjusted EBITDA for a margin of approximately 45%. As a result of our accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins, we expect adjusted EPS to grow $0.14 to $0.17 to a range of $6.20 to $6.40. Finally, we provide some additional guidance assumptions in the appendix material. 
As we enter 2021, I'm excited about our accelerating revenue growth and free cash flow generation. I believe we are uniquely positioned as a sustained higher-growth large-cap stock and will be able to drive consistent, long-term shareholder value.

So now as we enter into this year, it's really all about implementing that backlog, getting it stood up. I thought it was important to let everybody know that, for example, the Modern Banking Platform, we had 3 deals already go live this year, which is a good testament of that platform. It's now in market, processing. Obviously, we've got a lot of sales behind that, that are in the implementation cycle and continue to progress. 
But we feel good about where we are. We're not -- it's hard to predict termination fees at this point, but we see no indications that we're going to have challenges with termination fees or growing over a termination fee. So I think it's just going to be good execution on behalf of Banking through the implementation channel.

I think it's a great question, and Woody tried to address that in some of the capital allocation in the prepared remarks. As you think about it, M&A is going to continue to be an important pillar in our strategy. We're going to continue to look for things that accelerate our growth further from where we are today, large transformational M&A, where we think we're extremely good at integrating those kind of companies, you see the success rate we've had now with well over $740 million of cost out of Worldpay and over $200 million in revenue at this point. So we think there's a way to drive scale and drive complements to that. 
As we think about it, our aperture can be pretty wide. Diversification of revenue is an important differentiator for us. You've seen us actually do very well against our peer group in the middle of a COVID -- in the middle of a pandemic, which is all due to that diversification of revenue. So opening our aperture and looking for things that maybe could drive those kind of benefits I just described would be important. 
But we also -- to Bruce's point earlier, given our investment in innovation, given our investment in technology, our ability to launch new product and capability, we don't have to do M&A to continue to grow. But if we could find something that accelerates our growth, brings the necessary scale that we're looking for, or additive scale, has ability to take out costs, integrate that company, absolutely, we would do another M&A transaction."

So we're very confident in continuing to accelerate that 50 and 100 bps beyond this year, all while maintaining what we would view as really industry-leading investment back in innovation and growth.

Something that fill a gap in our capability, brings the necessary scale that we would need in a particular area that we're focused on. I think that can be translated into whether it's tuck-in or large transformational M&A. I also would tell you, we also have been pretty disciplined in our approach over the years, right? So this is not a company that has to do M&A in order to continue to grow and accelerate, and you see that with our guide. When we did the Worldpay combination, we guided to 7% to 9% growth. And this year, we're going to be in that range. And obviously, we feel comfortable we can maintain in that range going even into 2022 and beyond with margin expansion based on things we've talked about. 
So we'll continue to look at things that make sense for the company, things that drive scale, things that fill in product, things that we see, perhaps some markets moving in a direction where we think doing some type of M&A activity will be faster than us building it ourselves.

We anticipate significant growth, particularly in Merchant, in Q2 as we lap COVID impacts. We anticipate the mix to flip the other way, as we've talked about before, and we see volumes coming back in the discretionary areas and in travel and airlines to improve. We certainly do not have travel and airlines at the same pre-COVID levels throughout 2021. We think it'll take into 2022 before that actually comes back 100%, but certainly see outsized growth expectations in Merchant in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 of 2021. 
The remainder of the business, Banking, again, we anticipate acceleration off of Q4 into Q1 and then continue to see good, solid growth in each quarter. And then Capital Markets, we anticipate actually to accelerate over the course of the year with a difficult comp in the first quarter and then second and third quarter to move on. 
If you think about the cadence of EPS for the year, as we've outlined, the information around Q1 versus consensus estimates, obviously, we think consensus estimates are a little too high for Q1. We think Q2 and Q3 are roughly in line, and Q3 is a little low, to give you sort of the full cadence of the year. Q4, a little low. So that's a little bit there. 
MBP, we have converted 3 customers that are live now. We do anticipate it to drive $100 million of revenue in 2021, and we continue to work through the conversions of additional sales that we made throughout 2020."

The combination of lower travel into Q4, which we saw even lower travel into Q4, and the very tight lockdown in the U.K., which impacted retail and restaurant in the U.K., certainly, we saw impact from that in the fourth quarter that continues to show that separation. 
If you remember, we saw yields in the second quarter move away from volumes. We saw those come back some in the third quarter as economy reopened. And then as you saw, lockdowns go back in place in fourth quarter, we saw yields diverge again. So certainly a trend around that, that we're seeing at this point and can kind of predict and get some expectations around. I think at the end of the day, it's around when do the economies reopen. And certainly, either way, we are going to lap the COVID items by the end of March this year, regardless.

We outlined an accelerated expectation for Q4, we delivered on that. As I described earlier in the call, we anticipate continued acceleration over the remainder of the year. So that's pretty solid there. 
We've got a difficult comp in Cap Markets, but we anticipate accelerating growth into the mid- to high -- mid -- sorry, low to mid-single digits in Cap Markets with accelerating growth over the remainder of the year. I think that is a combination of the SaaS story we've been talking about where we're seeing more visibility into the revenue and less license sales and ongoing SaaS-based subscription-type revenue in the Capital Markets group. 
And then Merchant, obviously, we're looking at a COVID rebound as we lap comps and we continue to see economies reopen and some of the volumes come back. 
If you look at the Corporate and Other component, again, it's about 3% of overall revenue. The impact of that moving in there is less than 1 point -- less than 0.5 point, actually, of 2021. So very miniscule impact. But we are going to look to monetize and/or wind down some of those things that just aren't going to be a strategic fit on a go-forward basis."

And it's really bringing financial assets that were hard to get access to and bring those to the consumer and allow them to monetize those assets that they've acquired over time. 
And so whether it's online through someone like PayPal or some of our e-comm clients or it's in-store, at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. It just shows up at the point of sale, whatever that may be, whether it's your mobile phone or in-store. And again, it's really the surprise and delight that consumers love about it."

One, I just wanted to make sure in all the commentary on the growth, Woody, that you gave us, the kind of midpoint is, call it, 50 basis points above the long-term growth. I'm trying to sort through the puts and takes. I understand that something moved into Corporate, and that may have given us a little benefit of growth. But also, I'm trying to figure out where -- beyond that, is the above kind of long-term growth, is that more an easy comp from a Merchant point of view or is it more confidence in the Banking and Modern Banking Platform? As you guys sat and thought about how do we guide, what got you over the long-term kind of range or midpoint and got you a little higher?"

I think, first of all, the impact of moving some stuff into Corporate and Other was less than 0.5 point. It's not much at all in terms of our expectation. I would tell you that our confidence level is really in Banking, in the backlog around Banking and seeing it accelerate. We've moved that up to mid- to high single digits. You saw 5% in Q4. We anticipate that to accelerate into Q1. So I think that moving in the mid- to high single digits is a good bit of the confidence. 
Previously, too, we have talked about Cap Markets in the low single digits. We've actually kind of moved that up slightly into low to mid-single digits. So we anticipate Cap Markets to see better growth than historical this year as well. 
So I think those are the 2 biggest items that have kind of moved our confidence level up from the 7% to 9% to the 8% to 9% specific '21 guide versus outsized Merchant. Merchant, we just anticipate mid- to upper teens. And it could be higher than that if we see rebounds faster. We don't anticipate anything below mid-teens out of Merchant this year in any scenario that we have."

You guys talked a little bit about the need to continue investing organically. And Gary, you mentioned over the last few calls that don't put a lot of money into the Modern Banking Platform and new SaaS technology. It seems like the price tag of competing effectively in bank tech and payments is going up, and so there's a bit of an arms race. As you guys think about the capital intensity of the business and that 50 to 100 basis points kind of big-picture margin expansion, how do we balance participating in that arms race and winning that arms race along with still needing to -- still wanting to drive some of those scale advantages and showing that margin expansion to investors?"

I think whether it's an arm race or not, hopefully, what you're seeing is FIS is leading that. We started our cloud-based deployments 5 years ago.

I think whether it's an arm race or not, hopefully, what you're seeing is FIS is leading that. We started our cloud-based deployments 5 years ago. And at this point in time, we're well in excess of 70% of all of our compute now in the cloud, and that will trend over 80% here over the first half of this year. If you look at our investment, Woody highlighted almost $1 billion of capital a year. Keep in mind, that is us driving 60 new products in market, Modern Banking Platform; retooling our Payments One initiatives; Digital one, a cloud-native omnichannel platform on deployment; as well as all the things we're doing in Capital Markets and Merchant with our Access Worldpay gateway and others and also NAP conversion. 
So we -- I think we're balancing it very well. And we're doing that because these new technologies not only allow you to compete on the revenue front, they should and will drive cost out, right? If you start driving true AI into your organizations, you're going to eliminate costs, there's no way around it. If you automate, you're going to eliminate costs. And so our balance that we've done over the last several years as we went through the cloud migration that's now complete, we're doing the exact same thing with our platform rationalization as well as the exact same thing with new product launches, all while balancing. 
But we think we're in a really good position with about 8% of our revenue being deployed back into capital. Keep in mind also, as Woody talked about our free cash flow converting, we will have our debt completely reloaded by the end of this year. No sense paying our debt structure down faster. So that will even give us additional capital to deploy across that strategy, whether it's increasing share buybacks, whether it's increasing M&A or whether it's increasing new product capabilities to continue to drive our organic revenue growth in those upper single digits and then moving from there."

I want to provide some closing thoughts before we end the call. While the 1-year anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic isn't something we may celebrate with joy, I strongly believe there are reasons to applaud our collective perseverance and our passion for standing up and doing what's right. In this same time period, dominated by daily challenges of the virus, we stretched ourselves to evolve to think and deliver differently. At FIS, we took these challenges head on, and I firmly believe that we are a stronger, more resilient company from where we were a year ago. 
As the backbone to the global financial ecosystem, we ensured that transactions and accounts continue to be processed 24/7 while we reimagined our system implementation processes, enabling us to implement systems in a 100% virtual environment. We rapidly implemented a real-time lending platform for our financial institution clients, streamlining and speeding the processing of more than 225,000 PPP-approved loan under the CARES Act. So far in 2021, we've expanded our reach and successfully processed nearly $8 billion of PPP loan applications for more than 68,000 U.S. merchants and small businesses. 
We also managed the rollout and distribution of expanded EBT benefits under SNAP in 28 U.S. states and territories, helping over 10 million children. Just as important, we doubled down on our commitments to support our communities by executing global giveback programs to donate PP&E equipment and prepaid cards to support our frontline health care workers. 
We also recognize our responsibility to push for sustained social change, both domestically and globally. As you have heard us mention before, increasing inclusion and diversity, financial inclusion and climate change initiatives are important goals for all of us at FIS. Building an environment that enables our colleagues, clients and communities to thrive demonstrates how we are leveraging our technology and innovation at scale to create lasting change that benefits everyone.

We achieved very strong start to the year, exceeding our expectations across the board in the first quarter. 
As shown on Slide 5, we realized accelerating revenue growth, exceptionally strong new sales and significantly expanded margins across all our operating segments. Our Worldpay revenue synergies are also accelerating through increased cross-selling as well as ramping volumes on prior synergistic sales. As a result, we are increasing our 2021 and 2022 revenue synergy targets to $600 million and $700 million, respectively. 
During the quarter, we leveraged our continually strong free cash flow to begin buying back stock, fund our increased dividend and make strategic investments in intriguing new companies that are accelerating new capabilities and pushing the boundaries of financial technology. I'm also pleased to share that we divested our remaining minority position in Capco in April. netting a very positive return for our shareholders in over $350 million in proceeds for our remaining stake. These exceptional results demonstrate the strength of our business model, the success of our client-centric focus and our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Given that focus, we consistently invest in platform and solution innovation in the areas of greatest demand. 
As a result, FIS is the most modern scale provider in market with a unique suite of solutions that enable our clients to transform their environments, grow their businesses and engage with our customers in dynamic new ways. We are quickly becoming 1 of only 8 companies in the S&P 500 with revenues approaching $14 billion, growing more than 7% with an already high and expanding mid-40s EBITDA margins. We believe there is no one in our industry better positioned. With our strong start to the year, we expect accelerating organic revenue growth and strong earnings throughout 2021, giving us the confidence to raise our full year guidance. 
Turning to Slide 6. In banking, new sales grew 17% year-over-year, reflecting a 24% CAGR since the first quarter of 2019 as our investments in new solutions continue to yield impressive results not only in our traditional business but in emerging areas as well. For example, Green Dot, the world's largest prepaid debit card company with over $58 billion in annual volume, chose to expand our relationship this quarter to now include one of our B2B solutions to support their commercial customers as well as our online chat and social media solution for customer care to serve their mobile digital bank. In addition, we are helping large financial institutions to upgrade their legacy technology by moving to our next-generation cloud-based solutions. 
BMO Harris selected the modern banking platform this quarter, making them our 11th large win. And I'm pleased to share that 40% of our earlier wins are already live due to our software's elegant and modular design. This rapid onboarding continues to give us confidence in our accelerated revenue growth outlook for the remainder of the year. BMO chose to partner with us because of our open cloud-native and scalable platform, which will help them modernize the services they provide to their customers, speed new products to market and increase their operational efficiency. 
Vietnam's largest bank, BIDV, also chose FIS to upgrade their core banking software to harness the power of our global reach and world-class scale. With this win, we are now the core processor of Vietnam's 2 largest banks. As we think about continuing to increase our growth, we have several new solutions in our banking segment that we've launched recently and more in the pipeline to be released later this year. 
To highlight a few examples, PaymentsOne is the newest and most modern card issuing platform in the market, delivering an agile and frictionless payments experience across all card types on one unified platform. We spent the past year of migrating more than 1,000 of our issuing clients to this platform and have also seen strong demand from new clients where we've already installed more than 300 new financial institutions since the launch of this solution. 
RealNet is another innovative new solution being launched, which enables account-to-account transactions over real-time payment networks across the globe. This cloud-native SaaS platform will function as a network of networks, allowing our clients to seamlessly leverage multiple payment types to transact effortlessly around the world and across borders in real time. RealNet is proof of our strategy to support the global movement of money across the entire financial ecosystem for our clients in banking, merchant and capital markets. 
We've also launched an industry-first cryptobanking solution, which we created in partnership with NYDIG. Traditionally, consumers and corporations had to go outside of their existing banking relationships to acquire Bitcoin. Once an FIS core banking client enables this capability, their customers will be able to view and transact their Bitcoin holdings alongside their traditional accounts in a single view. Our new solution taps into the advanced functionality of Digital One to provide consumers with a user-friendly in-app experience. It will also allow our banking clients to grow their businesses through a new source of income by providing Bitcoin services through a seamless, easy-to-use digital experience. Each of these new launches reflect the power of our technology innovation and deep domain expertise. 
Turning to merchant on Slide 7. We revamped our go-to-market strategy, significantly improving new sales results as evidenced by our exceptional 76% growth. Our new sales success doesn't just reflect easy comps. New sales were up 39% over the first quarter of 2019, translating to an 18% CAGR over the past 2 years. We continue to successfully expand our financial institution partner program to serve SMBs. As an example, we formed an exclusive merchant referral partnership with CIT Bank this quarter. In this strategic takeaway, we will cross-sell merchant processing to CIT's over 45,000 customers expanding on an already successful relationship with our banking segment. 
We also continue to expand our leading ISV partner network, adding 20 new ISVs in the U.K. this quarter as well as several more in the U.S. and Canada that span a diverse range of verticals from retail, hospitality, salons and spas to event ticketing, education, property management and many others. 
As we look at large enterprise and leading global brands, we are the provider of choice due to our unique omnichannel capabilities, expansive global reach and best-in-class authorization rates. As an example, we won 80 new global e-commerce clients this quarter, more than doubling our new sales from last year. To keep pace with the demand, we are investing to grow our sales force by over 300 more professionals this year. 
During the quarter, for example, we won impressive new clients like HelloFresh, the well-known meal kit delivery company; and Didi, which is the Uber of China. We also won a diverse set of marquee clients such as Intercontinental Exchange; Betbull, a premier online sports betting company; and The Nature Conservancy, a preeminent global conservation organization. We continue to consistently win share in travel and airlines, including Norwegian cruise lines this quarter, and expect leading companies like this to accelerate rapidly as the industry recovers. 
As we think about newly formed high-growth sectors, FIS is the leading acquirer for cryptocurrency, where revenue from this vertical growing by 5x over last year. OKCoin, a leading cryptocurrency exchange selected FIS this quarter to help them grow their business. We serve 5 of the top 10 digital asset exchanges and brokerages globally, including innovators like Coinbase and BitPay. The results of our investment in new and modernized merchant technology is certainly showing in our sales success throughout our various merchant verticals. During the quarter, we successfully completed the final client migrations to our next-generation acquiring platform, also known as NAP, which enables us to offer a more agile experience and modular offering while still providing tailored solutions for our clients. We processed over 1.8 billion transactions on NAP during the first quarter and continue to expect accelerating growth now that we are aggressively selling in market. 
In addition to our new fully launched acquiring platform, we have seen tremendous success with the launch of our new gateway. Through our new simple APIs, merchants can go live on our platform faster while still benefiting from our full global breadth and sophisticated solutions. Our new APIs provide a seamless, easy-to-integrate single point of access for our clients, and transactions are ramping exponentially, ending the first quarter at more than 4 million transactions per day. This represents more scale than all but 2 of our largest e-com competitors in less than 2 years post launch. All of this shows that FIS is increasingly differentiated by our ability to bring innovation at scale that is enterprise ready from day 1 in a way that few can claim or offer today. 
In addition to leveraging our innovative portfolio of technology assets, our clients are also relying on us to support their expansion into new geographic markets. This quarter, we expanded our services into South Africa, Nigeria and Malaysia, and we plan to bring online several more countries later this year. Since the combination with Worldpay, FIS has now brought acquiring to 9 new countries. 
Turning to Slide 8. In Capital Markets, we have made remarkable progress since acquiring SunGard in 2015. We completely changed the revenue growth profile from persistent declines to accelerating top line growth. And I'm pleased to say that we are now consistently growing faster than our peers. We simultaneously improved margins and moved the business to over 70% reoccurring revenue. During the first quarter, average deal size increased 36% with new logos representing 30% of new sales, clearly showing that we are winning share. New sales of our SaaS-based reoccurring revenue solutions are also very strong, increasing by 57% this quarter. 
For example, our differentiated solutions and deep treasury expertise are motivating the leading corporate like GlaxoSmithKline, to select FIS to power their treasury management systems. In addition, our comprehensive suite of solutions, strong track record and speed of implementations is very attractive to emerging fintechs like [ acorns ] and Robinhood. These 2 fintechs are utilizing our solutions to further drive financial inclusion. As another example, [ Futu ] is a next-generation online broker-dealer who selected FIS this quarter to help power their growth in securities, finance and trading. 
Securian Financial is a great example of a diversified financial services company who partnered with us this quarter to deliver a leading cloud-based risk modeling and management platform. They selected FIS because they needed a partner who could support their growth and scale, while at the same time being nimble enough to help them quickly respond to changing regulatory requirements. 
I'd like to conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 9 before handing the call to Woody. The consistent execution of our strategy is driving our success. Ongoing investments in new solutions, advanced technology and expanding distribution are generating strong new sales and competitive takeaways while accelerating revenue growth across all our operating segments. Our relentless focus on achieving efficiency and scalability through automation and integration continues to enhance our profitability and margin profile. 
Lastly, we see our exceptional free cash flow generation as a competitive advantage. It allows us to consistently invest for growth and to generate superior shareholder returns through return of capital and M&A... In summary, our strategy is continuous transformation, pivoting the growth while simultaneously driving efficiency and scale through the strategic allocation of capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and forward guidance. Woody?"

Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations across all metrics to generate an adjusted EPS of $1.30 per share. On a consolidated basis, revenue",1044,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations across all metrics to generate an adjusted EPS of $1.30 per share. 
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 5% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, driven by better-than-expected performances in each of our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 10 basis points to 41%. Strong contribution margins and synergy achievement within each of our segments more than offset increased corporate expenses from unwinding last year's COVID-related cost actions. We continue to make excellent progress on synergies exiting the quarter at $300 million in run rate revenue synergies, an increase of 50% over the fourth quarter's $200 million, accelerating revenue synergy attainment driven primarily by ongoing traction and ramping volumes within our bank referral and ISV partner channels as well as cross-sell wins related to our new solutions and geographic expansion. Given our progress to date and robust pipeline, we're increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by 50% or $200 million to $600 million; and for 2022 by $150 million to $700 million. 
Our achievement of cost synergies has also been very successful. We have doubled our initial cost synergy target of $400 million, exiting the quarter with more than $800 million in total cost synergies. This includes approximately $425 million in operating expense synergies. Our backlog increased mid-single digits again this quarter and strong new sales more than offset our recognition of revenue in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our segment GAAP and organic results. As a reminder, the only difference between GAAP and organic revenue growth for our operating segments this quarter is the impact of currency. Our banking segment accelerated to 7% on a GAAP basis or 6% organically, up from 5% growth last quarter. These strong results were driven primarily by ramping revenues from our recent large bank wins, recurring revenue and issuer growth. Our issuing business grew 10% in the quarter, driven primarily by revenue growth from PaymentsOne, increased network volumes and economic stimulus. We expect both of these tailwinds to continue, driving accelerated growth into the second quarter in support of our outlook for mid- to high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full year. 
Capital Markets increased 5% in the quarter or 3% organically, reflecting strong sales execution and growing recurring revenue. The Capital Markets team is driving a fast start program for the beginning of 2021 and appears to be trending toward the higher end of our low to mid-single-digit organic growth outlook for the year. 
In merchant, we saw a nice rebound in growth of 3% in the quarter or 1% organically, accelerating 10 points sequentially as compared to the fourth quarter. Merchant's first quarter performance was driven primarily by strength in North America and e-commerce, including significantly ramping volumes on our new acquiring platform. COVID impacts on travel and airlines as well as continued lockdowns in the U.K. drove a 5-point headwind in the first quarter. 
Slide 13 shows the significant ramp in volumes and revenue that the merchant business generated throughout the quarter. Importantly, as volumes rebounded, yields grew significantly. We ultimately exited the quarter generating approximately 70% revenue growth during the last week of March, including 5 percentage points of positive yield contribution. We expect this positive revenue yield tailwind to continue to expand in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year. 
Based on March exit rates and second quarter comparisons, we expect merchant organic revenue growth of 30% to 35% in the second quarter. The expanding investments we are making in merchant technology platforms and global sales execution will yield long-term benefits for our clients and significant new wins for our business. As Gary highlighted, we are very pleased with the execution of our segments. With accelerating revenue growth and strong new sales, each of them are winning market share. 
Turning to Slide 14. We returned approximately $650 million to shareholders in the quarter through our increased dividend and share repurchases. We Starting in March, we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $143 per share. Beyond this return of capital, we also successfully refinanced a portion of our higher interest rate bonds, which extended our average duration by a year and lower expected interest expense for the year by about $60 million to approximately $230 million. Total debt decreased to $19.4 million -- $19.4 billion for a leverage ratio of 3.6x exiting the quarter, and we remain on track to end the year below 3x leverage. 
 Turning to Slide 15. I'm pleased to be able to raise our full year guidance early in the year based on our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook. For the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to continue to accelerate to a range of 13% to 14% consistent with revenue of $3.365 billion to $3.39 billion. As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by more than 400 basis points to approximately 44%. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.52 to $1.55 per share. For the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $13.65 million to $13.75 billion or an increase of $100 million at the midpoint as compared to our prior guidance driven primarily by accelerating revenue synergies. We continue to expect to generate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, equating to an EBITDA range of $6.075 billion to $6.175 billion. With our improved outlook, successful refinancing and share repurchase to date, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.35 to $6.55 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 20% and an increase of $0.15 at the midpoint above our prior guidance. By all measures, this was a great quarter for FIS. 
The investments we're making in driving strong new sales -- are driving strong new sales and accelerating our revenue growth profile. As a result, we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our increased outlook for 2021. I would like to thank our colleagues for their ongoing effort to drive FIS forward and to empower our clients to succeed. Operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

So you think about these large wins, it's not only what you're getting in revenue stream on the day 1 launch but how that revenue stream is going to accelerate over the coming years, which is why we're so excited about it. But the implementation time line still is determined a little bit by the overall complexity of the day 1 launch. And the team has done a remarkable job of automating these new technologies. Historically, where certain things might have taken weeks or months in the past or literally you've got them now to days or hours with automation, standing up new environments, et cetera.

And we continue to see that opportunity in front of us is a very good opportunity. When we look at the things that we're doing around our platform, whether it be the Access Worldpay, we feel that we're positioned very well. What I would say is the gaming market, as everyone knows, and you alluded to in your question, it has come along slower and it is finally starting to kind of accelerate here domestically. We have a great gaming business internationally. We have a lot of assets to bear there. And so I think we're prepared well to compete and compete very well here domestically as it starts to unfold."

And so we're in a really good spot in the upper bank market. In the lower end, we continue to see some consolidation but we tend to be the benefactor there as well. But we are seeing growing IT spend as people are coming out of the pandemic. And -- but that IT spend is positioned on where we've made investment, which is cloud-native technology. So whether it's -- we highlighted PaymentsOne and the success about 300 new financial institutions onboarding that platform in the last year, you look at what we're doing in Digital One in the movement of customers there and launching the NYDIG arrangement there or you go to monitor banking platform and look at the success and the size and scale of those. So I think we're well positioned in an increasing spend but because the spend is focused where we've made investments over the last 3 to 4 years. So we've got really good timing on the market and feel really good about it."

We play exceptionally well in the enterprise commerce space. That's the large-scale complex stuff that Gary talked about just a moment ago, that is a multi-country type of transactions. We're playing exceptionally well and very, very competitive in those spaces. There are some of these subsegments that historically we hadn't played in that have emerged.

And now you're starting to see it in the sales engine. In fact, given the demand that we're seeing, in our prepared remarks, we talked about adding 300 more salespeople just to the merchant business. And so that could give you the indication or not the demand we're seeing and the confidence we have in our capabilities to compete and win share. And you've seen a great result of that over the last -- not only in Q1 and our sales success going back to Q1 '19, but we also saw it ramping in Q4. So I do think more and more large enterprise merchants are consolidating down to single providers. And when you get to our capabilities, our ability for the ease of access, the multicurrency, the multi-country, all on a unified, most modern platform in market, we feel great about where we are."

We achieved very strong start to the year, exceeding our expectations across the board in the first quarter. As shown on Slide 5, we realized accelerating revenue growth, exceptionally strong new sales and significantly expanded margins across all our operating segments. Our Worldpay revenue synergies are also accelerating through increased cross-selling as well as ramping volumes on prior synergistic sales. As a result, we are increasing our 2021 and 2022 revenue synergy targets to $600 million and $700 million, respectively.  
During the quarter, we leveraged our continually strong free cash flow to begin buying back stock, fund our increased dividend and make strategic investments in intriguing new companies that are accelerating new capabilities and pushing the boundaries of financial technology. I'm also pleased to share that we divested our remaining minority position in Capco in April, netting a very positive return for our shareholders in over $350 million in proceeds for our remaining stake. 
These exceptional results demonstrate the strength of our business model, the success of our client-centric focus and our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Given that focus, we consistently invest in platform and solution innovation in the areas of greatest demand. As a result, FIS is the most modern scale provider in market with a unique suite of solutions that enable our clients to transform their environments, grow their businesses and engage with their customers in dynamic new ways. 
We are quickly becoming 1 of only 8 companies in the S&P 500 with revenues approaching $14 billion, growing more than 7% with an already high and expanding mid-40s EBITDA margins. We believe there is no one in our industry better positioned. With our strong start to the year, we expect accelerating organic revenue growth and strong earnings throughout 2021, giving us the confidence to raise our full year guidance.  
Turning to Slide 6. In banking, new sales grew 17% year-over-year, reflecting a 24% CAGR since the first quarter of 2019 as our investments in new solutions continue to yield impressive results not only in our traditional business but in emerging areas as well. For example, Green Dot, the world's largest prepaid debit card company with over $58 billion in annual volume, chose to expand our relationship this quarter to now include one of our B2B solutions to support their commercial customers as well as our online chat and social media solution for customer care to serve their mobile digital bank. 
In addition, we are helping large financial institutions to upgrade their legacy technology by moving to our next-generation cloud-based solutions. BMO Harris selected the modern banking platform this quarter, making them our 11th large win. And I'm pleased to share that 40% of our earlier wins are already live due to our software's elegant and modular design. This rapid onboarding continues to give us confidence in our accelerated revenue growth outlook for the remainder of the year. BMO chose to partner with us because of our open cloud-native and scalable platform, which will help them modernize the services they provide to their customers, speed new products to market and increase their operational efficiency.  
Vietnam's largest bank, BIDV, also chose FIS to upgrade their core banking software to harness the power of our global reach and world-class scale. With this win, we are now the core processor of Vietnam's 2 largest banks. 
As we think about continuing to increase our growth, we have several new solutions in our banking segment that we've launched recently and more in the pipeline to be released later this year. To highlight a few examples, PaymentsOne is the newest and most modern card issuing platform in the market, delivering an agile and frictionless payments experience across all card types on one unified platform. We spent the past year migrating more than 1,000 of our issuing clients to this platform and have also seen strong demand from new clients where we've already installed more than 300 new financial institutions since the launch of this solution.  
RealNet is another innovative new solution being launched, which enables account-to-account transactions over real-time payment networks across the globe. This cloud-native SaaS platform will function as a network of networks, allowing our clients to seamlessly leverage multiple payment types to transact effortlessly around the world and cross borders in real time. RealNet is proof of our strategy to support the global movement of money across the entire financial ecosystem for our clients in banking, merchant and capital markets.  
We've also launched an industry-first cryptobanking solution, which we created in partnership with NYDIG. Traditionally, consumers and corporations had to go outside of their existing banking relationships to acquire Bitcoin. Once an FIS core banking client enables this capability, their customers will be able to view and transact their Bitcoin holdings alongside their traditional accounts in a single view. 
Our new solution taps into the advanced functionality of Digital One to provide consumers with a user-friendly in-app experience. It will also allow our banking clients to grow their businesses through a new source of income by providing Bitcoin services through a seamless, easy-to-use digital experience. Each of these new launches reflect the power of our technology innovation and deep domain expertise.  
Turning to Merchant on Slide 7. We revamped our go-to-market strategy, significantly improving new sales results as evidenced by our exceptional 76% growth. Our new sales success doesn't just reflect easy comps. New sales were up 39% over the first quarter of 2019, translating to an 18% CAGR over the past 2 years. We continue to successfully expand our financial institution partner program to serve SMBs. 
As an example, we formed an exclusive merchant referral partnership with CIT Bank this quarter. In this strategic takeaway, we will cross-sell merchant processing to CIT's over 45,000 customers, expanding on an already successful relationship with our banking segment.  
We also continue to expand our leading ISV partner network, adding 20 new ISVs in the U.K. this quarter as well as several more in the U.S. and Canada that span a diverse range of verticals from retail, hospitality, salons and spas to event ticketing, education, property management and many others.  
As we look at large enterprise and leading global brands, we are the provider of choice due to our unique omnichannel capabilities, expansive global reach and best-in-class authorization rates. As an example, we won 80 new global e-commerce clients this quarter, more than doubling our new sales from last year. To keep pace with the demand, we are investing to grow our sales force by over 300 more professionals this year. 
During the quarter, for example, we won impressive new clients like HelloFresh, the well-known meal kit delivery company; and DiDi, which is the Uber of China. We also won a diverse set of marquee clients such as Intercontinental Exchange; BetBull, a premier online sports betting company; and The Nature Conservancy, a preeminent global conservation organization. 
We continue to consistently win share in travel and airlines, including Norwegian Cruise Lines this quarter, and expect leading companies like this to accelerate rapidly as the industry recovers.  
As we think about newly formed high-growth sectors, FIS is the leading acquirer for cryptocurrency, with revenue from this vertical growing by 5x over last year. OKCoin, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, selected FIS this quarter to help them grow their business. We serve 5 of the top 10 digital asset exchanges and brokerages globally, including innovators like Coinbase and BitPay. 
The results of our investment in new and modernized merchant technology is certainly showing in our sales success throughout our various merchant verticals. During the quarter, we successfully completed the final client migrations to our next-generation acquiring platform, also known as NAP, which enables us to offer a more agile experience and modular offering while still providing tailored solutions for our clients. We processed over 1.8 billion transactions on NAP during the first quarter and continue to expect accelerating growth now that we are aggressively selling in market.  
In addition to our new fully launched acquiring platform, we have seen tremendous success with the launch of our new gateway. Through our new simple APIs, merchants can go live on our platform faster while still benefiting from our full global breadth and sophisticated solutions. Our new APIs provide a seamless, easy-to-integrate single point of access for our clients, and transactions are ramping exponentially, ending the first quarter at more than 4 million transactions per day. This represents more scale than all but 2 of our largest e-com competitors in less than 2 years post launch. All of this shows that FIS is increasingly differentiated by our ability to bring innovation at scale that is enterprise ready from day 1 in a way that few can claim or offer today.  
In addition to leveraging our innovative portfolio of technology assets, our clients are also relying on us to support their expansion into new geographic markets. This quarter, we expanded our services into South Africa, Nigeria and Malaysia, and we plan to bring online several more countries later this year. Since the combination with Worldpay, FIS has now brought acquiring to 9 new countries.  
Turning to Slide 8. In Capital Markets, we have made remarkable progress since acquiring SunGard in 2015. We completely changed the revenue growth profile from persistent declines to accelerating top line growth. And I'm pleased to say that we are now consistently growing faster than our peers. We simultaneously improved margins and moved the business to over 70% reoccurring revenue. 
During the first quarter, average deal size increased 36% with new logos representing 30% of new sales, clearly showing that we are winning share. New sales of our SaaS-based reoccurring revenue solutions are also very strong, increasing by 57% this quarter.  
For example, our differentiated solutions and deep treasury expertise are motivating the leading corporate, like GlaxoSmithKline, to select FIS to power their treasury management systems. In addition, our comprehensive suite of solutions, strong track record and speed of implementations is very attractive to emerging fintechs like Acorns and Robinhood. These 2 fintechs are utilizing our solutions to further drive financial inclusion.  
As another example, Futu is a next-generation online broker-dealer who selected FIS this quarter to help power their growth in securities, finance and trading.  
Securian Financial is a great example of a diversified financial services company who partnered with us this quarter to deliver a leading cloud-based risk modeling and management platform. They selected FIS because they needed a partner who could support their growth and scale, while at the same time being nimble enough to help them quickly respond to changing regulatory requirements.  
I'd like to conclude my prepared remarks on Slide 9 before handing the call to Woody. The consistent execution of our strategy is driving our success. Ongoing investments in new solutions, advanced technology and expanding distribution are generating strong new sales and competitive takeaways while accelerating revenue growth across all our operating segments. Our relentless focus on achieving efficiency and scalability through automation and integration continues to enhance our profitability and margin profile.  
Lastly, we see our exceptional free cash flow generation as a competitive advantage. It allows us to consistently invest for growth and to generate superior shareholder returns through return of capital and M&A.  
In summary, our strategy is continuous transformation, pivoting to growth while simultaneously driving efficiency and scale through the strategic allocation of capital. 
I will now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and forward guidance. Woody?"

Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations across all metrics to generate an adjusted EPS of $1.30 per share.  On a consolidated basis, rev",1043,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our first quarter results, which exceeded our expectations across all metrics to generate an adjusted EPS of $1.30 per share.  
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 5% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, driven by better-than-expected performances in each of our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 10 basis points to 41%. 
Strong contribution margins and synergy achievement within each of our segments more than offset increased corporate expenses from unwinding last year's COVID-related cost actions. We continue to make excellent progress on synergies exiting the quarter at $300 million in run rate revenue synergies, an increase of 50% over the fourth quarter's $200 million, accelerating revenue synergy attainment driven primarily by ongoing traction and ramping volumes within our bank referral and ISV partner channels as well as cross-sell wins related to our new solutions and geographic expansion. 
Given our progress to date and robust pipeline, we're increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by 50% or $200 million to $600 million; and for 2022 by $150 million to $700 million.  
Our achievement of cost synergies has also been very successful. We have doubled our initial cost synergy target of $400 million, exiting the quarter with more than $800 million in total cost synergies. This includes approximately $425 million in operating expense synergies. Our backlog increased mid-single digits again this quarter as strong new sales more than offset our recognition of revenue in the quarter.  
Turning to Slide 12 to review our segment GAAP and organic results. As a reminder, the only difference between GAAP and organic revenue growth for our operating segments this quarter is the impact of currency. Our Banking segment accelerated to 7% on a GAAP basis or 6% organically, up from 5% growth last quarter. These strong results were driven primarily by ramping revenues from our recent large bank wins, recurring revenue and issuer growth. Our issuing business grew 10% in the quarter, driven primarily by revenue growth from PaymentsOne, increased network volumes and economic stimulus. We expect both of these tailwinds to continue, driving accelerated growth into the second quarter in support of our outlook for mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth for the full year.  
Capital Markets increased 5% in the quarter or 3% organically, reflecting strong sales execution and growing recurring revenue. The Capital Markets team is driving a fast start program for the beginning of 2021 and appears to be trending toward the higher end of our low to mid-single-digit organic growth outlook for the year. 
In Merchant, we saw a nice rebound, with growth of 3% in the quarter or 1% organically, accelerating 10 points sequentially as compared to the fourth quarter. Merchant's first quarter performance was driven primarily by strength in North America and e-commerce, including significantly ramping volumes on our new acquiring platform. COVID impacts on travel and airlines as well as continued lockdowns in the U.K. drove a 5-point headwind in the first quarter.  
Slide 13 shows the significant ramp in volumes and revenue that the Merchant business generated throughout the quarter. Importantly, as volumes rebounded, yields grew significantly. We ultimately exited the quarter generating approximately 70% revenue growth during the last week of March, including 5 percentage points of positive yield contribution. We expect this positive revenue yield tailwind to continue to expand in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year.  
Based on March exit rates and second quarter comparisons, we expect merchant organic revenue growth of 30% to 35% in the second quarter. The expanding investments we are making in merchant technology platforms and global sales execution will yield long-term benefits for our clients and significant new wins for our business. As Gary highlighted, we are very pleased with the execution of our segments. With accelerating revenue growth and strong new sales, each of them are winning market share.  
Turning to Slide 14. We returned approximately $650 million to shareholders in the quarter through our increased dividend and share repurchases. Starting in March, we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $143 per share. Beyond this return of capital, we also successfully refinanced a portion of our higher interest rate bonds, which extended our average duration by a year and lower expected interest expense for the year by about $60 million to approximately $230 million. Total debt decreased to $19.4 million -- $19.4 billion for a leverage ratio of 3.6x exiting the quarter, and we remain on track to end the year below 3x leverage.  
Turning to Slide 15. I'm pleased to be able to raise our full year guidance so early in the year based on our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook. For the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to continue to accelerate to a range of 13% to 14%, consistent with revenue of $3.365 billion to $3.39 billion. 
As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by more than 400 basis points to approximately 44%. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.52 to $1.55 per share. 
For the full year, we now anticipate revenue of $13.65 billion to $13.75 billion or an increase of $100 million at the midpoint as compared to our prior guidance driven primarily by accelerating revenue synergies. We continue to expect to generate adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45%, equating to an EBITDA range of $6.075 billion to $6.175 billion. 
With our improved outlook, successful refinancing and share repurchase to date, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.35 to $6.55 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 20% and an increase of $0.15 at the midpoint above our prior guidance. By all measures, this was a great quarter for FIS.  
The investments we're making in driving strong new sales -- are driving strong new sales and accelerating our revenue growth profile. As a result, we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our increased outlook for 2021. I would like to thank our colleagues for their ongoing effort to drive FIS forward and to empower our clients to succeed.

And now that you have new big ones like a BMO coming on, what are your expectations in terms of timing for onboarding? Is it -- has it improved now versus what it was, let's say, last year? And then the margin -- the incremental margin for these coming on, is it a little bit easier to scale?"

But I mean, it's really the complexity of day 1 implementation that's going to drive time line. So some of our customers that we're signing are coming on with a new capability or a new product day 1. Obviously, that launch can accelerate very, very quickly. 
The great news on that is then once you launch that solution, you'll start bringing additional products on across the deposit side of the retail bank, and then you'll move into lending, as we've talked about in the past. 
So you think about these large wins, it's not only what you're getting in revenue stream on the day 1 launch but how that revenue stream is going to accelerate over the coming years, which is why we're so excited about it. But the implementation time line still is determined a little bit by the overall complexity of the day 1 launch. 
And the team has done a remarkable job of automating these new technologies. Historically, where certain things might have taken weeks or months in the past where literally you've got them now to days or hours with automation, standing up new environments, et cetera. 
So the investments, to your point, that we've made in these newer technologies, they've really put us on a differentiated playing field in the market. And as Bruce talked about earlier, we're now starting to see the demand get generated from within the client. So now they're realizing they've got to make a move. I mean the environment's got to change. They have to embrace cloud. They've got to embrace cloud-native technologies in order to compete, to get their cost structures in alignment, to compete with the new disruptors. So we're in a really good position in -- especially in the large bank market."

So whether it's -- we highlighted PaymentsOne and the success, about 300 new financial institutions onboarding that platform in the last year, you look at what we're doing in Digital One in the movement of customers there and launching the NYDIG arrangement there or you go to monitor banking platform and look at the success and the size and scale of those.

We play exceptionally well in the enterprise commerce space. That's the large-scale complex stuff that Gary talked about just a moment ago, that is a multi-country type of transactions. We're playing exceptionally well and very, very competitive in those spaces.

In fact, given the demand that we're seeing, in our prepared remarks, we talked about adding 300 more salespeople just to the merchant business. And so that could give you the indication or not the demand we're seeing and the confidence we have in our capabilities to compete and win share. And you've seen a great result of that over the last -- not only in Q1 and our sales success going back to Q1 '19, but we also saw it ramping in Q4. So I do think more and more large enterprise merchants are consolidating down to single providers.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations across the board and demonstrate the continued success of our pivot to Growth strategy that we laid out before the pandemic. Revenue of $3",1217,"Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations across the board and demonstrate the continued success of our pivot to Growth strategy that we laid out before the pandemic. Revenue of $3.5 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. Revenue increased more than $500 million or 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS grew 40%. Sales results which were the strongest in our company's history, are being driven because our solutions remain in high demand, enabling businesses of all sizes to advance the way the world pays, banks and invest. This demand, combined with our organizational focus on delivering broader value to our clients was also reflected in a very strong cross sales, driving our largest revenue synergy quarter-to-date, increasing our run rate by 50% or $150 million sequentially to $450 million. This sales execution, in turn, drove a $1.5 billion increase to our backlog, which is now greater than $22 billion. Our strong execution is driving us to raise both our 2020 guidance and increase our year-end revenue synergy target to $700 million. In addition, as we consider client demand across our portfolio of solutions, we are extending our midterm outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024. I want to thank and recognize our colleagues around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. They are our most important asset and play a vital role in advancing the commerce and financial technology that keeps thousands of clients up and running and the economy moving [indiscernible].
Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight a few recent wins that demonstrate FIS' differentiation. Clients are increasingly demanding access to new capabilities that are outside of their traditional solution set so they can innovate in new and interesting ways. We have the unique ability to serve our clients horizontally across a breadth of financial technology with integrated cloud-native platforms. Further, our open APIs are resilient and easy to use as clients expand their relationships with FIS. Our sales success with the modern banking platform demonstrates its client demand as they look to differentiate with cloud-native capabilities. This quarter, we delivered the largest release since the start of MBP, including expansion of commercial deposit functionality as well as new enhancements to our lending module. As we have previously discussed, one of the exciting opportunities with the current MBP clients is an ongoing ability to cross-sell additional functionality in modules. This quarter, we had our first cross-sell to American Express, who added a new checking account feature to their deployment. This is a great example of our ability to land large complex clients and the value of our modern platform. As we continue to add functionality, clients continue adopting these new capabilities to grow their businesses, which drives additional revenue for FIS and expand these important relationships. Fifth Third Bank provides a second key example of the ways we grow our strategic relationships. Fifth Third is a longtime client who is on a journey to reengineer its technical infrastructure with a focus on resiliency and scale. This quarter, they expanded their relationship with us to replace their legacy in-house or with the modern banking platform and their legacy wealth management system with FIS Unity. Unity is our leading-edge global wealth management system and will provide rich data and insights for Fifth Third's customers throughout their wealth journey. It incorporates automated cash management, multicurrency and other advanced wealth management functionality and flexible design that is fully integrated with FIS Trust accounting. T. Rowe Price provides yet another example of an industry leader looking to FIS to help them modernize their 401(k) retirement offering with advanced technology. This landmark win will lay the foundation for other large asset managers to utilize FIS as they look to leverage our scale and expertise in the retirement space. In addition, PayPal and Chevron both expanded their relationships with us to begin utilizing our cloud-enabled payment switching capabilities. And finally, WesBanco joined our merchant referral network in order to upgrade to our leading acquiring technology. As we continue to innovate, our integrated cloud native ecosystem creates a powerful network effect that empowers our clients to transform and grow. 
On Slide 7, I want to highlight another important win. I'm pleased to announce that Walmart will begin utilizing our innovative loyalty network premium payback for both in-store and e-commerce transactions. The value proposition for this solution is exceptional, driving positive outcomes for our merchants, issuers and the end consumer. In other retail locations where we have rolled out the solution, we are seeing consumers accept premium paybacks offered to pay with points approximately 50% of the time when they are prompted. Both our merchant and our issuer clients are increasingly eager to participate and we expect adoption to continue to ramp as we implement the solution with all the innovative clients shown on the slide as well as more in the future. Premium Payback is a clear example of the network effect that we've created by integrating, issuing and acquiring. 
Turning to Slide 8. We invest heavily in new solutions and capabilities with the belief that the market is changing and how it consumes technology and looking for cloud-native architectures. The revenue contribution from solutions developed over the past 3 years continues to grow as a percent of our total revenue mix, up from less than 1% in 2019 to over 4% in 2021. This rapid growth is driven by our ability to cross-sell new solutions into our existing client base as well as adjacent verticals, which increases our total addressable market. New solutions also contribute meaningfully to our total revenue growth, with contribution increasing from less than 1% in 2019 to more than 2% in total revenue growth in 2021. Looking forward, we expect new solutions to drive up to 3 points of incremental growth each year, supporting our outlook for 7% to 9% revenue growth through the midterm. At this point, a strong commitment to innovation is embedded in our culture and will continue to drive growth for years to come. 
I will conclude my prepared remarks with Slide 9 before handing the call to Woody. We are at the forefront of the industry with the broadest collection of cloud-native solutions available. We remain uniquely positioned to serve domestic and multinational merchants who are looking for a single trusted provider for all of their acquiring needs. We solve our clients' most complex problems ranging from global acquiring for their e-commerce business to treasury and cash management with our innovative Quantum software. Further, on the right side of the page, we show our unique bundle of cloud native solutions for financial institutions that demonstrate our ability to innovate at scale. Lastly, we highlight a few examples of innovative solutions that create compelling value propositions for both merchant and FIS clients in the center of the page. Clearly, the investments we've made during the pandemic and driving differentiated outcomes for our clients and for us, and we continue to make these investments today in order to power future growth. It's why we are confident in our forward momentum to drive strong 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024. 
I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and forward guidance. Woody?"

On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion driven by outperformance in each of o",1093,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations. On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion driven by outperformance in each of our operating segments. Organic revenue growth was 16%. We haven't had any material M&A activity over the past year. So the difference between reported and organic revenue growth this quarter is primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 260 basis points to 44%, reflecting strong operating leverage and synergy contribution. As a result, adjusted EPS increased 40% year-over-year to $1.61 per share. As Gary mentioned, we had exceptional cross-selling quarter, driven primarily by premium payback, issuer processing, merchant referral and data analytics win. Given our progress and strength of our pipeline, we are increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by $100 million to exit the year at $700 million on an annualized run rate basis. Our achievement of cost synergies also continues to be successful, running further ahead of schedule than we anticipated when we announced the deal. We have more than doubled our initial cost synergy target of $400 million and are on track to exit the year with approximately $900 million in total annualized savings, including approximately $500 million in operating expense synergies. 
Turning to balance sheet and cash flow. We repurchased 2.7 million shares worth approximately $400 million during the quarter, bringing share repurchase to a total of $800 million year-to-date at an average price of $145 a share. Our leverage ratio declined to 3.3x, keeping us on track to end the year below 3x leverage. Lastly, we generated free cash flow in excess of $1 billion this quarter, which is the most in our company's history and reflects the highly cash generative nature of our business. 
Turning to Slide 12 to review our segments. Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8% due in part to strong issuer processing growth of 17% and a 30% increase in modern banking platform revenue. As Gary noted, we had another 2 MBP wins this quarter as well as an add-on sale and MBP revenue will continue to accelerate as more clients go live. We currently expect MBP revenue growth of nearly 50% for the full year 2021 and for this to further accelerate into 2022. The banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 410 basis points to 46%. These strong results were driven primarily by ramping revenues from our recent large bank wins as well as continued recurring revenue growth. Capital markets revenue growth also accelerated to 6% this quarter, reflecting strong recurring revenue growth and sales execution. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 46%. Lastly, for merchant revenue growth rebounded sharply to 45% in the second quarter, which includes 10 points of yield benefit and the segment generated its largest new seller in the history of the business. Merchants revenue acceleration included 31% revenue growth in e-commerce. Our eComm revenue growth is particularly impressive in light of in-store reopening as lockdown orders eased and cross-border travel remains affected making it an avenue for significant future growth. Growth was also broad-based expanding both domestic and international and discretionary verticals like restaurant are accelerating sharply. Merchants adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 910 basis points to 50%, primarily reflecting its high contribution margin and synergy benefits. As we begin to lap the pandemic with growth spanning online and in-store, SMB and enterprise across North America and International, our results clearly demonstrate the strength of our competitive position. In addition, growth includes both rebounding volume and yields as we expected. Relative to 2019, we've seen no increase in attrition, and we'll continue to grow our client count. We have not taken our foot off the gas, investing through the pandemic, completing now, ramping Access Worldpay, expanding our sales force, entering new countries and adding multiple strategic ISV and bank partners, including expanding integrated payments to Europe. The business clearly has strong underlying momentum. We expect to further drive acceleration relative to 2019 in the second half of the year. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. Based on our strong results and favorable outlook, I'm pleased to raise full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of $13.9 billion to $14 billion for the full year 2021, which represents an increase of $250 million over our prior guidance. This guidance assumes full year revenue growth for banking in the upper single digits and Capital Markets in the mid-single digits. We now expect merchant growth to approach 20% this year ahead of our initial expectations. Relative to 2019, Merchant revenue growth accelerated 9% in the second quarter or 12% in the U.S. We expect Merchant revenue growth to continue to accelerate into the mid- to high teens in the second half of the year as international revenue and discretionary verticals like travel and airlines continue to rebound versus 2019. We're also raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.125 billion to $6.2 billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.60 per share. For the third quarter, we expect 9% to 10% revenue growth and to generate revenue of $3.49 billion to $3.52 billion. As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand more than 50 basis points sequentially or about 200 basis points year-over-year to approximately 44% for the third quarter. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.66 to $1.69 in the first year. I'm excited about our results and raised guidance. Beyond our guidance for the year, we expect to generate 7% to 9% revenue growth in the midterm through 2024, as Gary discussed. 
I have comments on this outlook for a number of reasons. First, our sharp second revenue growth acceleration and our ability to significantly increase revenue guidance, show strong execution and the underlying strength in the business. Second, strong sales and cross-selling activity drove our backlog above $22 billion and increased our revenue synergy attainment by 50% in just 1 quarter, which will continue to drive future growth into 2022 and beyond. And finally, the investments we've made and continue to make are driving strength across our segments and accelerating our revenue growth profile. Our cloud native ecosystem of solutions is highly differentiated, helping us to grow in new and emerging verticals. 
I would like to thank our colleagues for their efforts to drive FIS forward and to empower our clients.

But frankly, we feel very comfortable not only competing in the national markets. But as we push down market into the SMB verticals, you're starting to see we're coming off record growth over the last 2 quarters in our merchant sales as we've now retooled our sales force and increased that and started pushing down market. But clearly, we've got the most extensive capabilities in the merchant acquiring space today, and you're seeing that growth across our large enterprise, our large nationals, our multinationals, and that's playing to our strength in our sales results. But at this point in time, our view on buy-now-pay-later is just that, another payment type that we're going to accept. We'll make sure that we have that available to our customers if they want to offer that, but we're going to minimize taking the credit exposure."

Right now, we feel very good about our competitive position of product set. You're seeing it come through in our our sales results.

But we're also seeing great adoption of our new product and innovation capabilities, modern banking platform is up over 50%. You're seeing our issuer business with payments gone up substantially. You'd look at what we've done in capital markets, about end-to-end solutioning across the front, middle and back office, and you're seeing accelerated revenue growth there in capital markets as well. So when we look at sales holistically, as I said, all 3 segments were up, had a record quarter from a sales perspective. But it really was -- it was new logo sales, actually gaining share and taking share. It was cross-sell to existing customers of new product capabilities we're delivering to market or cross-selling existing products and then revenue synergies across the Worldpay integration efforts. So couldn't be more pleased with our sales channel. And as I point out, you guys have seen this. We've now had multiple years of record sales and seeing that demand continue to accelerate. So that's what has us so bullish on the future of FIS. And you've seen the growth rates across all 3 segments consistently trend up as well.

So you get a ramp effect of that going into that and also the new products and capabilities we're selling. But it's really just in delivery of that backlog into Q3.

When you look at Fifth Third, it's a substantial increase for us in contract value in the relationship because keep in mind a number of those capabilities, they're going off in-house systems to our systems in a fully outsourced manner. And so -- so for us, we see a significant step function as we deliver those capabilities and then start recognizing that revenue through the processing channel.

Discretionary verticals are also improving as we've seen in both restaurant being up very sharply, both domestically and internationally. We really haven't seen any attrition. And our actual merchant count is up year-over-year and about 5% up sequentially during the second quarter. So you have the sales, you add the merchant count, add the outlook in terms of the yield benefit and the volume expectations, we feel really good about the back half of the year being in that mid- to high teens. Further, we saw July improving compared to June and it's in line with our 3Q guidance that we just put out and generally in line with the networks as well. And then the international business is trending a little higher than the U.S. in terms of volume improvement in July. So you add all those things together, that's how we think about mid- to high teens growth compared to 2019, both Q3 and Q4."

And when you look at the backlog, you look at the acceleration of $22 billion, you look at the pipeline, you look at records signings in Q2, following record signings in Q1, followed by a record year last year in sales. You look at the delivery channel of what we're onboarding, you look at the trend and the recovery going on. I mean, we feel very confident in extending to 7% to 9% in growth and look at accelerating further beyond that. You've got capital markets that we used to look as -- a low single-digit grower. You're seeing that move into, what, 6% organic growth this quarter. You're now in the mid-single digits. You're going to see capital markets given its sales success trend towards the upper single digits. Banking is getting well established in the upper single digits, giving its backlog and giving it sales success. And then you look at the strength of the merchant portfolio and the recovery. I mean we had strong recovery across every one of the verticals we participate in. Our sales were strong across all those verticals as well. The yield dynamics have recovered from where we -- just as we said they would back to kind of 2019 levels. So all of that comes together. We just got a lot of confidence that the engine is running very well and the growth aspects, just booking the historical sales to date will continue to propel us into that 7% to 9% range through 2024. Now obviously, we look at the pipeline as well. We've got a lot of confidence in what we're seeing shaping up in Q3, Q4 and into next year.

We started this transformation almost now 4 years ago. Bruce mentioned a number of the products we're bringing online, modern banking platform, Digital One, PaymentsOne, the list goes on and on in banking and you're seeing a high demand for that. So we're taking share from traditional in-house where large -- very large financial initiations actually built their own systems or leverage some type of offshoring capability to build their own through some augmentation or just running a very old piece of technology that's been in existence for decades. And so they're now reaching in and taking advantage of some of our modern architectures. And doing it through our cloud because of all the investments that we've made in cloud-based technologies.

The team has done a very nice job of expanding the sales team and the technology stack and starting to push in the markets that Worldpay traditionally didn't play in. We're starting to see a nice acceleration there. So we expect that segment in the coming years to be a consistent double-digit performer on organic growth, which is used to perform below that historically. When you look at the banking business, I would say the banking business is operating the way we thought it would. We have good line of sight in that for a number of years of our investments. And we're seeing that actually kind of hit the numbers exactly where we projected and realizing that we were expecting some big ramps and big ramps through the sales initiatives. So we made a lot of investments there, and that business has been fundamentally transformed. And so we're seeing the results that we had hoped for. Capital Markets actually has improved over what we thought. We traditionally thought when we bought capital markets, there was a a strong position to expand there. We saw the ability to bring solutions to market, not just products, move beyond the licensing business into an outsourcing business. And we thought if we did that, we were conservative and thought mid- to low single-digits organic growth there. And what we've seen is that business has transformed actually faster and the demand for our front, middle and back office solutioning, the new investments we made around RegTech and some of the higher growth areas of that market have really paid big dividends. And so now we're seeing that move much closer to the banking business. So I think that's going to continue to accelerate for us.

Rowe Price as well as Fifth Third are 2 of the largest transactions that we've ever won in terms of size of contract. And they'll have some short-term pressure on margin as we continue to ramp up those customers and get their revenues moving. This flows all the way from a revenue driving at full run rate, showing the operating leverage in the business.

You certainly saw some benefit in half of July with some of the U.K. reopening as we assume the volume is increasing there. Certainly continue to monitor everything as things go along. But feel good about what we're seeing right now in terms of volumes outside the U.S. continuing to improve. They are lagging the U.S. a little bit, as we talked about. We certainly saw the U.S. outpace international growth in the second quarter, but we anticipate the international areas to continue to drive into the back half of the year."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations across the board and demonstrate the continued success of our pivot to growth strategy that we laid out before the pandemic.Revenue of $",1216,"Thanks, Nate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations across the board and demonstrate the continued success of our pivot to growth strategy that we laid out before the pandemic.
Revenue of $3.5 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. Revenue increased more than $500 million or 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EPS grew 40%. Sales results, which were the strongest in our company's history, are being driven because our solutions remain in high demand, enabling businesses of all sizes to advance the way the world pays, banks and invest.
This demand, combined with our organizational focus on delivering broader value to our clients, was also reflected in a very strong cross sales, driving our largest revenue synergy quarter-to-date, increasing our run rate by 50% or $150 million sequentially to $450 million. This sales execution, in turn, drove a $1.5 billion increase to our backlog, which is now greater than $22 billion. Our strong execution is driving us to raise both our 2021 guidance and increase our year-end revenue synergy target to $700 million.
In addition, as we consider client demand across our portfolio of solutions, we are extending our midterm outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024. I want to thank and recognize our colleagues around the globe for their continued hard work and dedication. They are our most important asset and play a vital role in advancing the commerce and financial technology that keeps thousands of clients up and running and the economy moving today.
Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to highlight a few recent wins that demonstrate FIS' differentiation. Clients are increasingly demanding access to new capabilities that are outside of their traditional solution set so they can innovate in new and interesting ways. We have the unique ability to serve our clients horizontally across the breadth of financial technology with integrated cloud-native platforms.
Further, our open APIs are resilient and easy to use as clients expand their relationships with FIS. Our sales success with the Modern Banking Platform demonstrates its client demand as they look to differentiate with cloud-native capabilities. This quarter, we delivered the largest release since the start of MBP, including expansion of commercial deposit functionality as well as new enhancements to our lending module.
As we have previously discussed, one of the exciting opportunities with the current MBP clients is an ongoing ability to cross-sell additional functionality and modules. This quarter, we had our first cross-sell to American Express who added a new checking account feature to their deployment. This is a great example of our ability to land large, complex clients and the value of our modern platform. As we continue to add functionality, clients continue adopting these new capabilities to grow their businesses, which drives additional revenue for FIS and expands these important relationships.
Fifth Third Bank provides a second key example of the ways we grow our strategic relationships. Fifth Third is a long-time client who is on a journey to reengineer its technical infrastructure with a focus on resiliency and scale. This quarter, they expanded their relationship with us to replace their legacy in-house core with the Modern Banking Platform and their legacy wealth management system with FIS Unity.
Unity is our leading-edge global wealth management system and will provide rich data and insights for Fifth Third's customers throughout their wealth journey. It incorporates automated cash management, multi-currency and other advanced wealth management functionality in a flexible design that is fully integrated with FIS Trust Accounting. 
T. Rowe Price provides yet another example of an industry leader looking to FIS to help them modernize their 401(k) retirement offering with advanced technology. This landmark win will lay the foundation for other large asset managers to utilize FIS as they look to leverage our scale and expertise in the retirement space.
In addition, PayPal and Chevron both expanded their relationships with us to begin utilizing our cloud-enabled payment switching capabilities. And finally, WesBanco joined our merchant referral network in order to upgrade to our leading acquiring technology. As we continue to innovate, our integrated cloud-native ecosystem creates a powerful network effect that empowers our clients to transform and grow.
On Slide 7, I want to highlight another important win. I'm pleased to announce that Walmart will begin utilizing our innovative loyalty network, Premium Payback, for both in-store and e-commerce transactions. The value proposition for this solution is exceptional, driving positive outcomes for our merchants, issuers and the end consumer.
In other retail locations where we have rolled out the solution, we are seeing consumers accept Premium Payback's offer to pay with points approximately 50% of the time when they are prompted. Both our merchant and our issuer clients are increasingly eager to participate. And we expect adoption to continue to ramp as we implement the solution with all the innovative clients shown on the slide as well as more in the future. Premium Payback is a clear example of the network effect that we've created by integrating issuing and acquiring.
Turning to Slide 8. We invest heavily in new solutions and capabilities with the belief that the market is changing in how it consumes technology and looking for cloud-native architectures. The revenue contribution from solutions developed over the past 3 years continues to grow as a percent of our total revenue mix, up from less than 1% in 2019 to over 4% in 2021. This rapid growth is driven by our ability to cross-sell new solutions into our existing client base as well as adjacent verticals which increases our total addressable market.
New solutions also contribute meaningfully to our total revenue growth with contribution increasing from less than 1% in 2019 to more than 2% in total revenue growth in 2021. Looking forward, we expect new solutions to drive up to 3 points of incremental growth each year, supporting our outlook for 7% to 9% revenue growth through the midterm. At this point, a strong commitment to innovation is embedded in our culture and will continue to drive growth for years to come.  
I will conclude my prepared remarks with Slide 9 before handing the call to Woody. We are at the forefront of the industry with the broadest collection of cloud-native solutions available. We remain uniquely positioned to serve domestic and multinational merchants who are looking for a single trusted provider for all of their acquiring needs. We solve our clients' most complex problems ranging from global acquiring for their e-commerce business to treasury and cash management with our innovative Quantum software.
Further, on the right side of the page, we show our unique bundle of cloud-native solutions for financial institutions that demonstrate our ability to innovate at scale. Lastly, we highlight a few examples of innovative solutions that create compelling value propositions for both merchant and FIS clients in the center of the page.
Clearly, the investments we've made, enduring the pandemic and driving differentiated outcomes for our clients and for us, and we continue to make these investments today in order to power future growth. It's why we are confident in our forward momentum to drive strong 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024.  
I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and forward guidance. Woody?"

On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion, driven by outperformance in each of",1094,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today.
Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations. On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion, driven by outperformance in each of our operating segments. Organic revenue growth was 16%. We haven't had any material M&A activity over the past year, so the difference between reported and organic revenue growth this quarter is primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate.
Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 460 basis points to 44%, reflecting strong operating leverage and synergy contribution. As a result, adjusted EPS increased 40% year-over-year to $1.61 per share. As Gary mentioned, we had exceptional cross-selling quarter, driven primarily by Premium Payback, issuer processing, merchant referral and data analytics win. Given our progress and strength of our pipeline, we are increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by $100 million to exit the year at $700 million on an annualized run rate basis.
Our achievement of cost synergies also continues to be successful, running further ahead of schedule than we anticipated when we announced the deal. We have more than doubled our initial cost synergy target of $400 million and are on track to exit the year with approximately $900 million in total annualized savings, including approximately $500 million in operating expense synergies.  
Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, we repurchased 2.7 million shares worth approximately $400 million during the quarter, bringing share repurchase to a total of $800 million year-to-date at an average price of $145 a share. Our leverage ratio declined to 3.3x, keeping us on track to end the year below 3x leverage. Lastly, we generated free cash flow in excess of $1 billion this quarter, which is the most in our company's history and reflects the highly cash-generative nature of our business.  
Turning to Slide 12 to review our segments. Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8% due in part to strong issuer processing growth of 17% and a 30% increase in Modern Banking Platform revenue. As Gary noted, we had another 2 MBP wins this quarter as well as an add-on sale, and MBP revenue will continue to accelerate as more clients go live. We currently expect MBP revenue growth of nearly 50% for the full year 2021 and for this to further accelerate into 2022.
The Banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 410 basis points to 46%. These strong results were driven primarily by ramping revenues from our recent large bank wins as well as continued recurring revenue growth. Capital Markets revenue growth also accelerated to 6% this quarter, reflecting strong recurring revenue growth and sales execution. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 46%. 
Lastly, for Merchant, revenue growth rebounded sharply to 45% in the second quarter, which includes 10 points of yield benefit, and the segment generated its largest new sales quarter in the history of the business. Merchant's revenue acceleration included 31% revenue growth in e-commerce. Our eCom revenue growth is particularly impressive in light of in-store reopening as lockdown orders eased and cross-border travel remains affected, making it an avenue for significant future growth.
Growth was also broad-based, spanning both domestic and international, and discretionary verticals like restaurant are accelerating sharply. Merchant's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 910 basis points to 50%, primarily reflecting its high contribution margin and synergy benefits. As we begin to lap the pandemic with growth spanning online and in-store, SMB and enterprise across North America and international, our results clearly demonstrate the strength of our competitive position. In addition, growth includes both rebounding volume and yields as we expected.
Relative to 2019, we've seen no increase in attrition, and we'll continue to grow our client count. We have not taken our foot off the gas, investing through the pandemic, completing now -- ramping Access Worldpay, expanding our sales force, entering new countries and adding multiple strategic ISV and bank partners, including expanding integrated payments to Europe. The business clearly has strong underlying momentum. We expect to further drive acceleration relative to 2019 in the second half of the year.  
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. Based on our strong results and favorable outlook, I'm pleased to raise full year guidance. We now anticipate revenue of $13.9 billion to $14 billion for the full year 2021, which represents an increase of $250 million over our prior guidance. This guidance assumes full year revenue growth for Banking in the upper single digits and Capital Markets in the mid-single digits. We now expect Merchant growth to approach 20% this year, ahead of our initial expectations.
Relative to 2019, Merchant revenue growth accelerated 9% in the second quarter or 12% in the U.S. We expect Merchant revenue growth to continue to accelerate into the mid to high teens in the second half of the year as international revenue and discretionary verticals like travel and airlines continue to rebound versus 2019. We're also raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.125 billion to $6.2 billion and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.60 per share.
For the third quarter, we expect 9% to 10% revenue growth and to generate revenue of $3.49 billion to $3.52 billion. As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially or about 200 basis points year-over-year to approximately 44% for the third quarter. This will result in adjusted EPS of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. I'm excited about our results and raised guidance. Beyond our guidance for the year, we expect to generate 7% to 9% revenue growth in the midterm through 2024, as Gary discussed.
I have confidence in this outlook for a number of reasons. First, our sharp second quarter revenue growth acceleration and our ability to significantly increase revenue guidance show strong execution and the underlying strength in the business. Second, strong new sales and cross-selling activity drove our backlog above $22 billion and increased our revenue synergy attainment by 50% in just 1 quarter, which will continue to drive future growth into 2022 and beyond. And finally, the investments we've made and continue to make are driving strength across our segments and accelerating our revenue growth profile. Our cloud-native ecosystem of solutions is highly differentiated, helping us to grow in new and emerging verticals.

On the margin itself, we are increasing incentive accruals to reward our people for their very strong performance compared to our operating plan, which we're outpacing significantly this year.

But clearly, we've got the most extensive capabilities in the merchant acquiring space today, and you're seeing that growth across our large enterprise, our large nationals, our multinationals, and that's playing to our strength in our sales results. But at this point in time, our view on buy now, pay later is just that, another payment type that we're going to accept.

Will we do additional M&A in the future? Absolutely. Things are expensive. Right now, we continue to see the intrinsic value of our stock is undervalued. And so obviously, we're very focused on share buybacks and deploying free cash flow in that manner, but we're not opposed to doing M&A activity if it fits our strategy and fills in a gap in our overall capability.
Right now, we feel very good about our competitive position of product set. You're seeing it come through in our sales results.

I mean you're seeing us succeed our cross-sales and revenue synergies with the Worldpay integration. We're real pleased on that, with the acceleration, and Woody highlighted a number of those products. But we're also seeing great adoption of our new product and innovation capabilities. Modern Banking Platform is up over 50%. You're seeing our issuer business with PaymentsOne up substantially. You'd look at what we've done in Capital Markets about end-to-end solutioning across the front, middle and back office, and you're seeing accelerated revenue growth there in Capital Markets as well.
So when we look at sales holistically, as I said, all 3 segments were up, had a record quarter from a sales perspective. But it really was -- it was new logo sales actually gaining share and taking share. It was cross-sells to existing customers of new product capabilities we're delivering to market or cross-selling existing products and then revenue synergies across the Worldpay integration efforts. So couldn't be more pleased with our sales channel.
And as I point out, you guys have seen this, we've now had multiple years of record sales and seeing that demand continue to accelerate. So that's what has us so bullish on the future of FIS. And you've seen the growth rates across all 3 segments consistently trend up as well. And now that the global pandemic, we're starting to see opening, obviously, in the U.S., Europe is lagging a little bit there and Asia, but as you're starting to see reopening, you'll just continue to see more accelerated growth going forward."

We don't need a lot of sales to hit that Q3 number. It really is backlog. You saw the backlog increased 8% which is, I think, on memory, one of the largest increases we've seen of that backlog. It's certainly the largest the backlog has been. So the team is doing a great job of delivering new capabilities. We've now got 6 of our clients on MBP in production. So you get a ramp effect of that going into that and also the new products and capabilities we're selling. But it's really just in delivery of that backlog into Q3. And so that just goes to show as that backlog builds, you're going to see a consistent ramp across that Banking segment.
When you look at Fifth Third, it's a substantial increase for us in contract value and the relationship because keep in mind, a number of those capabilities, they're going off in-house systems to our systems in a fully outsourced manner. And so for us, we see a significant step function as we deliver those capabilities and then start recognizing that revenue through the processing channel. So it's a great relationship we've had with Fifth Third for a very long time. So we're excited about expanding this and excited about helping them re-architect their technology stack for the future."

And our actual merchant count is up year-over-year and about 5% up sequentially during the second quarter.
So you add the sales, you add the merchant count, you add the outlook in terms of the yield benefit and the volume expectations, we feel really good about the back half of the year being in that mid to high teens. Further, we saw July improving compared to June, and it's in line with our 3Q guidance that we just put out and generally in line with the networks as well.

You've got capital markets that we used to look as a low single-digit grower. You're seeing that move into, what, 6% organic growth this quarter. You're now in the mid-single digits. You're going to see Capital Markets, given its sales success, trend towards the upper single digits. Banking is getting well established in the upper single digits, given its backlog and given its sales success. And then you look at the strength of the Merchant portfolio and the recovery, I mean we had strong recovery across every one of the verticals we participate in. Our sales were strong across all those verticals as well. The yield dynamics have recovered from where we -- just as we said they would, back to kind of 2019 levels. 
So all of that comes together. We just got a lot of confidence that the engine is running very well and the growth aspects, just booking the historical sales to date will continue to propel us into that 7% to 9% range through 2024. Now obviously, we look at the pipeline as well. We've got a lot of confidence in what we're seeing shaping up in Q3, Q4 and into next year.

They're trying to respond and becoming more nimble and take cost out and getting more digitally native. And that's where that plays to the strength of FIS. We started this transformation almost now 4 years ago. Bruce mentioned a number of the products we're bringing online, Modern Banking Platform, Digital One, PaymentsOne, the list goes on and on and on in banking, and you're seeing a high demand for that.
So we're taking share from traditional in-house where large -- very large financial institutions actually built their own systems or leveraged some type of off-shoring capability to build their own through some augmentation or just running a very old piece of technology that's been in existence for decades. And so they're now reaching in and taking advantage of some of our modern architectures and doing it through our cloud because of all the investments that we've made in cloud-based technologies.

The team has done a very nice job of expanding the sales team and the technology stack and starting to push in the markets that Worldpay traditionally didn't play in. We're starting to see a nice acceleration there. So we expect that segment in the coming years to be a consistent double-digit performer on organic growth, which used to perform below that historically. 
When you look at the Banking business, I would say the Banking business is operating the way we thought it would. We've had good line of sight in that for a number of years of our investments. And we're seeing that actually kind of hit the numbers exactly where we projected and realizing that we were expecting some big ramps and big ramps through the sales initiatives. So we made a lot of investments there, and that business has been fundamentally transformed. And so we're seeing the results that we had hoped for.
Capital Markets actually has improved over what we thought. We traditionally thought when we bought Capital Markets, there was a strong position to expand there. We saw the ability to bring solutions to market, not just products, move beyond the licensing business into an outsourcing business. And we thought if we did that, we were conservative and thought mid- to low-single-digits organic growth there. And what we've seen is that business has transformed actually faster. And the demand for our front, middle and back-office solutioning, the new investments we made around RegTech and some of the higher growth areas of that market have really paid big dividends. And so now we're seeing that move much closer to the Banking business. So I think that's going to continue to accelerate for us.

We are seeing higher incentive accruals, as we've talked about, driving that up to reward our people for outperforming our operating plan. You've got that as one component.

We are seeing higher incentive accruals, as we've talked about, driving that up to reward our people for outperforming our operating plan. You've got that as one component. I would tell you, incremental incentive accruals, Ashwin, are about $0.04 in our full year outlook of incremental there. We also are seeing continued wins in these large deals that are taking some time to get up and running. T. Rowe Price as well as Fifth Third are 2 of the largest transactions that we've ever won in terms of size of contract. And they'll have some short-term pressure on margin as we continue to ramp up those customers and get their revenues moving.
This flows all the way from a revenue driving at full run rate, showing the operating leverage in the business. But you have to ramp that revenue up and you have a little bit of a headwind in terms of the margin rate as we continue to see accelerated revenue on the top line. So those are really kind of the components I've tried to highlight in there as what's driving the margin. From a one-timer perspective, not a lot of one-timers in here, pretty clean in terms of the quarter, and feel good about what we've executed on."

We'll have really strong margin expansion for the full year this year. Also highlights just how well we're doing with operating synergies and all of the revenue growth.

Our third quarter results demonstrate continued strength of execution across the company, with revenue growing 10% to reach $3.5 billion. Margins expanded 270 basis points to exceed 45% and adjusted EPS increase",1884,"Thanks, Nate, and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results demonstrate continued strength of execution across the company, with revenue growing 10% to reach $3.5 billion. Margins expanded 270 basis points to exceed 45% and adjusted EPS increased 22% to $1.73 per share.
We continue to see elevated demand across our solution portfolio with sales execution driving a 7% organic increase in our $22 billion backlog across banking and capital markets. Revenue synergies related to our Worldpay integration increased to $150 million in the quarter, bringing the total $600 million on an annual run rate basis. We remain on schedule to exceed $700 million exiting this year, beating our original target by 40% while accomplishing this feet a year early.
Our cost synergies tell a similar story, increasing to $875 million in the quarter and on schedule to exit the year around $900 million. This is inclusive of approximately $500 million in operational expense as we look to conclude our Worldpay integration well ahead of schedule.
In the quarter, new wins across a wide range of clients illustrate strategy is working and gives us confidence in our growth. In Banking, these include another 2 Modern Banking Platform wins, including one with PayPal. PayPal will utilize the Modern Banking Platform to enable their new high-yield savings account. These new wins continue to demonstrate the versatility of our new cloud-native software.
Turning to our Merchant segment. We continue to build on its differentiated global e-commerce offering. Our extensive global reach is a significant differentiator for us. We operate in 146 countries, accounting for 126 different currencies and support more than 300 alternative payment methods. This allows us to remove complexity and cost while increasing authorization rates for multinational enterprises like Microsoft, who recently expanded our relationship from a single region to now span the globe.
Our ability to offer sophisticated capabilities and rapidly expand into emerging new verticals also differentiates FIS. For example, we continue to build a strong foundation in crypto, signing Crypto.com, this quarter. We won this business by demonstrating authorization rates that are far superior to their incumbent provider. We also expanded our global travel and airlines market share, winning Allegiant as an impressive new domestic carrier.
In capital markets, Citi is the latest example of a client transitioning from legacy in-house to a fully outsourced solution with FIS, while another innovative technology company will leverage 7 of our capabilities to help power their digital registered investment advisory solution. We cannot be happier with the significant growth the team is driving out of our Capital Markets segment. Our solutions are highly differentiated and proven throughout the industry.
It's important to note that our new wins across all our segments include financial institutions, domestic and multinational merchants as well as leading technology companies and innovative fintechs. Few other companies can provide such a complementary set of solutions. I am proud of our team for their ongoing dedication to our clients and for delivering another strong performance this quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. While our team continues to execute at a very high level, our share price is clearly not performing well. Over the last few months, our management team engaged in open and constructive dialogue with the investment community about areas where we can improve the messaging and transparency of our business. We believe in the strength and value of our company. And on today's call, we will directly address the 3 most common questions we heard. 
I'll begin by providing an update on our leading competitive position as well as our capital allocation strategy to sustain and accelerate growth. Woody will then provide a deep dive into the merchant segment after he recaps the quarter's financial performance.
The bear case assumes that FIS is standing still or unable to compete, and this is definitely not the case. We anticipated the changing competitive landscape and invested heavily in technology and innovation over the last 5 years. Ours is a durable business model, and FIS will remain a global leader with sustainable competitive advantages now and into the future. Therefore, we will continue to provide additional clarity, as needed, to ensure that our shareholders properly understand our business, strategy and the true value of FIS.
Turning to Slide 7. FIS has the best collection of assets in the industry. Banking and capital markets generate approximately 2/3 of our revenue mix with exclusive long-term contracts and deep client relationships, covering mission-critical applications needed to operate our clients' businesses. These segments grew through the pandemic, demonstrating the durability of their revenue streams and are growing faster than ever.
Our ongoing investment in new technologies, Indian software suites within these segments generates increased recurring revenue and accelerated organic growth. Through 3 quarters, our year-to-date new sales already exceeded that of the entire year in 2020, which was also a record year for FIS. This historical success has now created $22 billion in backlog of signed revenue, which I referenced earlier. 
Given our year-to-date success, 2021 is going to be another record-setting year for sales, and that will drive continued strong growth across these segments into 2022 and beyond.
Our Merchant segment currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenue mix. It boasts deep client relationships with exceptionally high retention rates that are supported by sophisticated vertical expertise and 5-star client service. Our expert professionals are on the ground in every geography to meet any need.
Our clients depend on us to support their global ambitions by opening every sales channel to them with innovative software-led and omnichannel capabilities. Here, too, we are generating record new sales, and revenue growth is accelerating as high-growth channels account for an increasing proportion of the segment's growth. Given the market dynamics in these high-growth channels, we expect to consistently win new clients and expand our share of wallet. 
Another key advantage is our extensive global distribution and enviable client portfolio, which enable us to quickly and effectively drive adoption of new technologies. There's a reason why incumbents, innovators and disruptors consistently choose FIS as their partner of choice. These durable revenue streams, combined with our scale of delivery, allow us to aggressively invest in differentiated solutions and capabilities.
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to directly address the strength of our competitive position and why this company will continue to lead the way powering the global digital economy. FIS powers the intersection of software, payments and embedded finance. Our core competency is commerce enablement, whether that's the electronification of banking, enabling electronic transactions online or at the point of sale or automating treasury, B2B and wealth and retirement. We have multiple competitive advantages, including breadth of capability, global reach, extensive distribution and an enviable client portfolio.
With our infrastructure migration to the cloud now complete and the Worldpay integration coming to a close, I'd like to share our strategy to further enhance our competitive position and generate shareholder value. Our strategy is to unlock the true value of FIS by weaving together our extensive digital assets into a global platform that facilitates the rapid adoption of new technology and speeds innovation.
By componentizing our capabilities, we will expose our unique set of financial assets to the market as well as continue to push new product through this emerging platform. It expands our TAM by positioning FIS as the destination for innovators and developers, where they can get everything they need to create exciting new customer experiences. And it helps them to do it faster by providing preconfigured capabilities, low-code and no-code technology, third-party integration as well as sandboxes for experimentation and rapid prototyping, complete with the developer forum.
Importantly, for our shareholders, it will speed time to revenue for FIS through automation and self-service, while simultaneously creating additional scale benefits by eliminating technology debt. This strategy supports our midterm outlook for 7% to 9% revenue growth, 50 to 100 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and superior free cash flow. Our past success demonstrates that we execute major programs very well, and our team will keep FIS at the forefront of the industry by executing the next phase of our enterprise technology transformation.
As we do this over the next 3 years, you'll hear us talk less and less about segments as traditional silos and old ways of thinking fade to the background. Instead, we'll begin sharing exciting examples of a new class of super users, who combine technology across the breadth of FIS in new and exciting ways. Each of these super users is buying capabilities from all 3 of our traditional segments, demonstrating a powerful value unlock for FIS.
Amazon is a great example of the power that our portfolio brings to clients. They started their journey with us by leveraging our nice debit network capabilities a decade ago. Today, they utilize our enterprise acquiring capability for Whole Foods, our global e-commerce capability, to enter new online markets and our treasury cash management solution out of capital markets. And we've expanded the relationship by leveraging our omnichannel capability to empower their new Amazon 4-star in-store concept internationally, opening its first location in the U.K.
At FIS, we embrace being a scaled technology leader and look forward to continuing to advance the industry by enabling the next generation of innovative client experiences.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reviewing our capital allocation strategy on Slide 9. Our priority is to deliver long-term growth by investing internally to improve the value we bring to our clients while expanding our TAM. In parallel, we continue to actively pursue M&A to add innovative new capabilities as well as to enter high-growth adjacencies.
Our team has a well-established track record of successfully integrating the businesses we acquire, consistently outperforming our synergy targets and driving shareholder value. Through this combination of investments in organic and inorganic opportunities, we have successfully accelerated revenue growth by positioning FIS to deliver innovative solutions in attractive markets where our technology and expertise are highly differentiated.
The scale and profitability of our business puts us in the enviable position of being able to both invest for growth while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $2 billion in shares, reflecting our view that FIS currently represents a generational buying opportunity.
We still maintain significant headroom for accelerated share repurchase with 85 million shares of authorization remaining, and we will buy back stock aggressively. We are committed to consistent dividend growth and are increasing our expected annual dividend growth rate to 20% in 2022 and beyond. This will enable us to expand our dividend payout ratio over several years without affecting our ability to invest in growth. Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. This strategy has been consistent for many years, and we will continue to allocate capital to drive robust shareholder returns.
In conclusion, while competition is intense across our industry. FIS is built for purpose as the leading commerce enablement company. At FIS, we're doing what no one else can, bringing together a unique breadth of capability and global reach to enable our clients to innovate at speed.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and to provide a deep dive into the Merchant segment. Woody?"
10081196,1684497289,2424860,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our third quarter results and touch on our balance sheet, cash flow and guidance before taking you through our additional merchant disclosures.Both reported an",1650,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our third quarter results and touch on our balance sheet, cash flow and guidance before taking you through our additional merchant disclosures.
Both reported and organic revenue growth were 10%.  Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 270 basis points, reflecting high contribution margins and ongoing synergy benefit. Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8%, reflecting continued new sales execution. The Banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points to 46%, primarily due to ramping revenues from recent large bank wins as well as continued recurring revenue growth.
Capital Market's revenue growth also accelerated to 11% this quarter, primarily due to strong recurring revenue growth as well as 2 points of tailwind created by aiming of client renewals. Capital Market's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 330 basis points to 48%, again reflecting high contribution margins and operating leverage. I'll leave Merchant for now and discuss its quarterly performance with its deep dive later.
Turning to Slide 12. We generated free cash flow in excess of $1.1 billion in the quarter, representing 33% of revenue or 107% of adjusted net earnings. We tripled the pace of our share buybacks during the quarter, repurchasing 9 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. While we are aggressively buying stock back right now, we remain active in the M&A market.
As Gary mentioned, we are increasing our dividend growth rate in 2022 from 10% to 20% per year. We're going to continue to invest for growth, and this will have no impact on our ability or intention to do so. In fact, it will only consume about $100 million of incremental cash during 2022, which is insignificant as compared to our annual free cash flow. To be clear, if our adjusted EPS grows mid-teens and our dividend grows by 20%, we will reach the 35% payout ratio towards the end of this decade.
On Slide 13, you'll see that we're keeping our full year guidance mostly unchanged after raising it earlier this year. We're increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range to $6.50 from $6.45 per share. We brought up the lower end of our EPS guide due to our operating results and share repurchase during the third quarter. To add further color on fourth quarter, consensus revenue and EPS are in line with our expectations. I'm expecting some incremental pressure on margins due to rising labor costs and for this to be offset by lower share count.
As it pertains to the platform initiatives Gary mentioned, this does not represent incremental investment but continues the enterprise transformation that we've been executing on for the past 5 years. This is included in our midterm outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth and 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion. As usual, we will provide detailed guidance assumptions in the appendix.
With that, let's begin the merchant deep dive on Slide 15. As Gary mentioned, we heard your feedback and are striving to further increase transparency into the merchant business. I will provide an additional layer of revenue detail and outlook for the business in the next several slides.
Starting with our third quarter results. Merchant revenue grew 18%, excluding about 4 points of headwind created by the unusual timing of the U.S. tax filing deadline in 2020. Merchant's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 380 basis points to approximately 52%, which reflects the segment's high contribution margins and ongoing synergy benefit.
Many of our shareholders told us they are evaluating Merchant growth rates versus the comparable period in 2019. Therefore, I will describe growth rates through the rest of this deep dive on that basis as compared to 2019 and pro forma for the Worldpay acquisition.
It's clear that our business is rebounding, with revenue growth accelerating from 3% in the first quarter to 9% in the second quarter to 16% in the third quarter. On Slide 16, we show how closely our volumes continue to track with the networks. Clearly, the 3 of us don't grow exactly the same every quarter or in every country, but the consistency of FIS' performance relative to the networks throughout the pandemic challenges the bear case in my mind.
In addition, we included quarterly volume and transaction data within our earnings release going back to the first quarter of 2019. We provide this extra level of transparency to create easy comparisons so that shareholders can better evaluate any concerns about share loss.
We provide additional revenue detail by client type on Slide 17. Our global e-commerce business serves web-only merchants. It excludes omnichannel merchant revenue, which is included in enterprise. Global e-commerce is our fastest-growing client type and creates a key strategic advantage. Enterprise includes North American merchants with more than $5 million in annual sales volume in the U.K. This is a scale business with meaningful cross-selling opportunities. We have powerful distribution channels and serve marquee brands across both global e-commerce and enterprise, making us the go-to choice for new technology partners striving for adoption.
Finally, software-led SMB is comprised of U.S. small merchants with less than $5 million in annual sales volume. We service these merchants primarily through software-led or technology-enabled partners who are attracted to our world-class scale and leading enterprise capabilities.
Moving down this slide, the pie chart show merchants revenue mix by these 3 client types. The text below the pies defines each client type and summarizes our respective strategies for each. Along the bottom of the slide, we show the quarterly revenue growth progression on a pro forma basis as compared to 2019, where the clear takeaway is the recovery thus far. The next 3 slides dive deeper, including TAM growth for each client type based on total merchant acquiring TAM from BCG's Global Payments 2020, Global Payments 2021 report.
Beginning on Slide 18, our global e-commerce business is differentiated by its global reach. We have the unique ability to help leading multinational companies and global brands seamlessly transact around the world. Unlike most of our peers, who gateway domestic card-not-present transactions within various countries, we enable multinational transactions with local licensing to support our clients' global expansion.
In the upper right-hand corner, we show Global e-commerce's estimated TAM growth of 13% to 15% on a revenue basis. Our e-com mix is split roughly 50-50 between the U.S. and international. As you can see, domestic e-com TAM is growing upper single digits, while cross-border TAM is growing 25% to 30%. This is why our global reach is so important. It provides a distinct advantage in the fast-growing area of the market. Lastly, SMB e-com TAM is growing 12% to 14%. We don't currently play in this portion of the market and see it as a strategic expansion opportunity.
As you can see by the elevated growth rates in the lower right corner, FIS is benefiting from the accelerating shift online. Our mix of fast-growing e-com revenue continues to increase, creating the opportunity for us to continue to outpace global merchant acquiring TAM as a whole.
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss enterprise. Many of our enterprise relationships are decades long and built on sophisticated vertical expertise, such as our unique debit routing, Snap and Wick capabilities within the grocery vertical. Serving global enterprise clients require significant scale economies to compete at low price points, while quickly and nimbly integrating new technologies. Enterprise TAM is growing 4% to 7%, split between the U.S. and international. Within the enterprise, we see the greatest potential for future growth through continued geographic expansion enabled by our global footprint and international banking relationships.
Our software-led SMB business is shown on Slide 20. U.S. SMB TAM is growing 7% to 9%. We have experienced significant recovery each quarter this year, with most of our verticals growing 20%-plus during the quarter. Restaurant is the notable exception. While also demonstrating a strong recovery trend, its growth is slower than other verticals. It's difficult to discern whether this is due to slower reopenings, staffing challenges or the performance of some of our partners. However, our win rates continue to improve on leads given to us by our ISV partners, and we continue to sign new ISV partners, making it clear that there is not a problem with our service. Further, our software-led strategy provides significant advantages across the SMB space by providing deep vertical expertise. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that expanding SMB e-com is a significant opportunity for us, especially following the launch of Access Worldpay. In any event, as you can see on Slide 21, it's 2% of our consolidated revenue.
I'd like to leave you with 2 thoughts before we open the line to Q&A. First, we continue to enjoy significant competitive advantages across the breadth of our business. 65% of our revenue is driven from banking, capital markets with long-term contracts and sticky client relationships. Within the 32% of our revenue mix in merchant, we are differentiated by our global e-com, enterprise and software-led capabilities. While the market appears to be focused on U.S. SMB, which represents a sliver of our revenue, our strategy is about driving growth across the enterprise by enabling digital commerce in every segment and in every vertical, as Gary described.
Second, on Slide 22, we believe that 8% to 10% TAM growth for the total acquiring market reinforces our outlook for sustained double-digit revenue growth within merchant. We have a strong e-commerce business that continues to grow as a portion of our overall revenue mix. The international expansion opportunity in enterprise creates additional upside, and we have a really unique opportunity to drive our e-com capabilities downstream into SMB.
We are confident in the future of FIS, and I would like to thank our colleagues for their continued efforts and serving our clients and driving our business forward.

But I guess, the revenue side, you do derive revenue both from volume and transactions. So if we want to benchmark revenue against some of those metrics, how would you guide us there? And I think, ultimately, we all want to get a better sense of pricing like-for-like and how that's evolving because mix clearly plays a role?"

We tried to outline both volume growth and transaction growth within the detailed materials in the press release. I think we also gave growth back to 2019 as many of us have been trying to effectively forget 2020 in some levels and ways. We have seen volume growth compared to 2019, a track very closely to the networks. We've also see transaction growth slow a little bit in terms of its growth rate, ultimately providing us incremental yield on that volume, which is what we expected and where we expected to continue to track.
If you look at 2Q 2019 growth of revenue versus the global volume compared to the third quarter, we had about 9 points of incremental yield benefit. And that really takes out kind of the noise between both 2020 and the move shift of the tax movement. So that's the one we've been very focused on. But we try to be extremely transparent today to give you every piece of data that we look at and thinking about our revenue growth trajectory."

Does this mean you envision FIS servicing larger diversified clients that I would imagine have some buying power? But are you also suggesting that there's a shift from maybe point solutions or best-of-breed consumption versus bundled buying? Just trying to think about all of this because you have different peers and of course, you have a lot of scale across all these different businesses. But what's the vision here longer term?"

What we've seen across all markets, all industries is really what we've talked about is more around solutioning and being able to leverage the platform in a way to drive very dynamic outcomes for our customers, and that's what we're all about. 
So as you think about FIS, all large companies are going to have to go through a massive transformation. And so we started that 5 years ago. And we now have completed -- completely completed our transition to cloud. So we've made that migration and we're getting all the benefits of the cloud platforms that are available. We then leaned in with next-generation application stacks, and we talked a lot about that through componentization, whether it's modern banking platform, whether it's Payments One, whether it's Digital One, whether it's NAP, the list goes on and on.
So now the next phase is how do you bring that together and weave that together to a one-stop place for innovators, large conglomerates, anybody looking to take advantage of various capabilities in the open market, and we see it as a huge opportunity. We highlighted just a very small subset of clients already leveraging our next-generation capabilities across all 3 segments. 
You're going to see that grow very dramatically over the next 3 years. You will also continue to see our level of technology debt get displaced as our existing clients migrate to this framework as well. So we're really excited about the future. We highlighted another 2 wins on modern banking platform today. One of those wins was the first customer that is signed up for an existing core banking system of FIS to start transitioning to MVP.
So as we've talked a lot, we're really at the forefront of this transformation, and this is just the next step in FIS' journey. And we'll continue -- and while we're so confident in our long-term guide of 7% to 9% and mid-teens EPS, and you'll continue to see that resonate in the coming years."

So yes, Jason, those are the 2 comments I really would think about margin. If you think about 2022, we're not updating our formal 2022 guide until February. That said, we're not changing anything in terms of our midterm outlook around 2022 of 7% to 9% revenue growth and 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion.

As you know, we've also been very consistent about getting other large M&A opportunities behind us before we typically move on into other areas. We've talked on prior calls, the market is pricey on certain things, but we're definitely going to continue to lean in on M&A. We're going to be a buyer in the market on things that fit our strategy, that expand our TAM, that drive us new product or new capabilities that drive us in the adjacent market.

Secondly, on your accretion dilution comment around whether we would do something that's dilutive, we don't look at accretion dilution as the only value metric. In fact, we think it's probably just one of many. Value creation long term is much more in how we think about M&A, whether it's enhancing our growth profile or filling out gaps strategically into our product portfolio that we can push through our distribution channel.

So you're now seeing the results of that. Our pipeline is the fullest -- continues to grow. You're also seeing record quarters being put up by the sales team in record years, year after year. This -- if you'll remember in banking, especially, this journey started well over 3 years ago. And you've seen that growth rate move from low single digits to mid-single digits, and now it's performing consistently in the upper single digits. So we feel great about the business. We feel great about our solution set.
The TAM is very broad because, obviously, we're not just a domestic player in the U.S. We can expand out into international markets. as well in global markets. So we've got a really bright future with this group. And frankly, it's where the industry is moving, more importantly.
Capital markets, as I said in my prepared remarks, couldn't be prouder of the team of what they've done. When you go back to 2015, you had a business that was growing negative -- about negative 2%. We've repositioned the portfolio. We invested heavily in product and solutioning. We started going -- and we expanded outside of traditional customers because what we found is there was a lot of market that needed those kind of capabilities, and you're now seeing the results.
That's a very, very clean quarter for capital markets. I mean there was a 2 percentage point tailwind on license renewals. But once again, what a great part of that business is those licenses are term in nature. And so you get those bumps. But even if you adjust that out, just really, really strong results."

And our teams have really rallied around that. They've done an excellent job of building out the product set, building out how people consume them and put us in a very good position.
As Gary mentioned, our pipeline has been excellent. Sales execution has been at an all-time high. Yet again, after an all-time high last year, capital market is same thing, a lot of crazy. Probably the other comment I would add is, as we've gone through these projects over the last several years, while our capital was originally on data center consolidation and some of those things, as we've come to a close of those, we're taking that capital and redeploying it in new products and accelerating our new products to meet the challenges of our customers.

And these customers have traditionally been on older, more legacy technologies.

And you just can't do that on your historical point-to-point solutions.
At FIS, we've made the investments to time this shift. And so as you -- now you're seeing the benefits of what that timing is starting to produce. So these are very long-term contracts, are high reoccurring. We're averaging 9- to 12-month sales cycle. We're averaging about 9 months now on an onboarding cycle. Bruce and his team has done a nice job of pulling that back, and that will get faster over time.

I would tell you, I don't know that we believe it's going to be back at 100% by the end of 2022, but it's certainly going to be better than where it is today, which is at about 65% or 70% of what we saw in 2019.

But the reality is, given the nature of our e-commerce business and how rapidly it's growing, you see the disclosure there almost mid-30% in the last several quarters and trending up. T&A will become a smaller and smaller segment of our overall business.
And so that's what we're really thrilled about our positioning in the merchant space. As you look at that business, we are best positioned in the market area that's growing the fastest. And so -- and we've got industry-leading capabilities there.
So as long as we continue to execute on it, like Woody said, we're seeing a little slowing in the recovery in T&A. But the good news is the other side of the business has actually accelerated a little faster in some of the verticals. 
So all in all, we've got a great business model, and we've got one that's going to continue to perform in the double digits going forward in 2022 and beyond."

As you know, Ash, when we own the consulting company for a number of years and actually didn't see that fit in our overall strategic narrative. So we'll continue to partner with large system integrators out there and other large consulting firms. As you can imagine, given the investment we've made in componentization, we have a lot of people wanting to partner with us on that front, which is great.
And given the demand we've had, you'll continue to see those partnerships grow. But that's owning another consulting group is not necessary. I think Bruce summed it up on a prior question very well, and Woody just confirmed it. If you look at the amount of CapEx that we're investing back into our existing systems, really, right now, it's operating about 8.5% of revenue that's trended up a little bit. historically before we started on this journey. As you might remember, it was down in the 4.5% type range. So we trended it up years ago because we saw this coming.
The reality is, as you think about it, this transformation has come in waves, right? We had to embrace the cloud technology to get our cost down, to get our availability up, to get our speed on delivery up. You're seeing that in the numbers. You then saw us come on our application wave and really building out within our industry verticals, whether that's NAP, Access Worldpay, whether that's modern banking platform, Payments One, Digital One, whether that's all the things we're doing in capital markets around solutioning and really going into in and front-minded back office. 
You've now heard us talk about, on this call, We're now -- rolling out the next generation of our platform, which is really taking those components and weaving them together in a really way to embrace new markets that we're not serving today. So we're still going to be taking advantage of all the markets we're in, driving the kind of growth you're seeing.
But now as you weave that in through a platform as you start bringing in low code and no code environments, as you start bringing in places for innovators to come and incubate, we see that a whole another opportunity to expand TAM given the investments we've made. And we don't think that's going to require an increased capital investment at all because as those other programs are closing, that frees up capital to now redeploy.
So I think it shows a real confidence in execution, given where our guide is. It shows a real confidence in the company, and we'll continue to lean in on all those fronts."

Ashwin, it's a great question. I think you've heard us over the last several quarters and really even pre our acquisition of Worldpay that the Worldpay team, and we believe it was the right strategy continues to focus and invest on e-com to drive e-com growth even faster. If you remember, this 27% of our revenue mix in the highest growing segment, was significantly lower, 4, 5 points lower than that just a few years ago. So most of our investment in geo expansion, most of our investment in NAP, most of our investment and Access Worldpay continuing to improve speed of onboarding capabilities in market and investment in that growth profile. That's absolutely where we've been focusing. 
Further, if you go back to the global e-commerce slide where we talk about it specifically, our mix right now is 50-50 between domestic and cross-border. We think you can also grab some incremental e-commerce market share over time in a pretty high growing SMB market, where we really don't play today.
So yes, that's where a lot of our focus is, is to drive this portion of our revenue mix up significantly. Hopefully, over time, going in as much as 50% of our total revenue mix in these high-growth markets. And we think that's an excellent way for us to continue to sustain very strong growth in the Merchant segment."

Our third quarter results demonstrate continued strength of execution across the company, with revenue growing 10% to reach $3.5 billion.

Our third quarter results demonstrate continued strength of execution across the company, with revenue growing 10% to reach $3.5 billion. Margins expanded 270 basis points to exceed 45%, and adjusted EPS increased 22% to $1.73 per share. 
We continue to see elevated demand across our solution portfolio, with sales execution driving a 7% organic increase in our $22 billion backlog across banking and capital markets. Revenue synergies related to our Worldpay integration increased to $150 million in the quarter, bringing the total to $600 million on an annual run rate basis. We remain on schedule to exceed $700 million exiting this year, beating our original target by 40%, while accomplishing this feat a year early. 
Our cost synergies tell a similar story, increasing to $875 million in the quarter and on schedule to exit the year around $900 million. This is inclusive of approximately $500 million in operational expense as we look to conclude our Worldpay integration well ahead of schedule. 
In the quarter, new wins across a wide range of clients illustrate that our strategy is working and gives us confidence in our growth. In Banking, these include another 2 modern banking platform wins, including one with PayPal. PayPal will utilize the Modern Banking Platform to enable their new high-yield savings account. These new wins continue to demonstrate the versatility of our new cloud-native software. 
Turning to our Merchant segment. We continue to build on its differentiated global e-commerce offering. Our extensive global reach is a significant differentiator for us. We operate in 146 countries, accounting for 126 different currencies and support more than 300 alternative payment methods. This allows us to remove complexity and cost, while increasing authorization rates for multinational enterprises like Microsoft, who recently expanded our relationship from a single region to now span the globe. 
Our ability to offer sophisticated capabilities and rapidly expand into emerging new verticals also differentiates FIS. For example, we continue to build a strong foundation in crypto, signing Crypto.com, this quarter. We won this business by demonstrating authorization rates that are far superior to their incumbent provider. 
We also expanded our global travel and airlines market share, winning Allegiant as an impressive new domestic carrier. 
In Capital Markets, Citi is the latest example of a client transitioning from legacy in-house to a fully outsourced solution with FIS, while another innovative technology company will leverage 7 of our capabilities to help power their digital registered investment advisory solution. We cannot be happier with the significant growth the team is driving out of our Capital Markets segment. Our solutions are highly differentiated and proven throughout the industry. 
It's important to note that our new wins across all our segments include financial institutions, domestic and multinational merchants as well as leading technology companies and innovative fintechs. Few other companies can provide such a complementary set of solutions. I am proud of our team for their ongoing dedication to our clients and for delivering another strong performance this quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. While our team continues to execute at a very high level, our share price is clearly not performing well. Over the last few months, our management team engaged in open and constructive dialogue with the investment community about areas where we can improve the messaging and transparency of our business. We believe in the strength and value of our company. And on today's call, we will directly address the 3 most common questions we heard.  
I'll begin by providing an update on our leading competitive position as well as our capital allocation strategy to sustain and accelerate growth. Woody will then provide a deep dive into the Merchant segment after he recaps the quarter's financial performance. 
The bear case assumes that FIS is standing still or unable to compete, and this is definitely not the case. We anticipated the changing competitive landscape and invested heavily in technology and innovation over the last 5 years. Ours is a durable business model, and FIS will remain a global leader with sustainable competitive advantages now and into the future. Therefore, we will continue to provide additional clarity as needed to ensure that our shareholders properly understand our business, strategy and the true value of FIS. 
Turning to Slide 7. FIS has the best collection of assets in the industry. Banking and Capital Markets generate approximately 2/3 of our revenue mix, with exclusive long-term contracts and deep client relationships covering mission-critical applications needed to operate our clients' businesses. These segments grew through the pandemic, demonstrating the durability of their revenue streams and are growing faster than ever. 
Our ongoing investment in new technologies, Indian software suites within these segments generates increased recurring revenue and accelerated organic growth. Through 3 quarters, our year-to-date new sales already exceed that of the entire year in 2020, which was also a record year for FIS. 
This historical success has now created $22 billion in backlog of signed revenue, which I referenced earlier. Given our year-to-date success, 2021 is going to be another record-setting year for sales, and that will drive continued strong growth across these segments into 2022 and beyond. 
Our Merchant segment currently accounts for about 1/3 of our revenue mix. It boasts deep client relationships with exceptionally high retention rates that are supported by sophisticated vertical expertise and 5-star client service. Our expert professionals are on the ground in every geography to meet any need. 
Our clients depend on us to support their global ambitions by opening every sales channel to them with innovative software-led and omnichannel capabilities. Here, too, we are generating record new sales, and revenue growth is accelerating as high-growth channels account for an increasing proportion of the segment's growth. Given the market dynamics in these high-growth channels, we expect to consistently win new clients and expand our share of wallet.  
Another key advantage is our extensive global distribution and enviable client portfolio, which enable us to quickly and effectively drive adoption of new technologies. There's a reason why incumbents, innovators and disruptors consistently choose FIS as their partner of choice. These durable revenue streams, combined with our scale of delivery, allow us to aggressively invest in differentiated solutions and capabilities. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to directly address the strength of our competitive position and why this company will continue to lead the way powering the global digital economy. FIS powers the intersection of software, payments and embedded finance. Our core competency is commerce enablement, whether that's the electronification of banking, enabling electronic transactions online or at the point of sale or automating treasury, B2B and wealth and retirement. We have multiple competitive advantages, including breadth of capability, global reach, extensive distribution and an enviable client portfolio. 
With our infrastructure migration to the cloud now complete and the Worldpay integration coming to a close, I'd like to share our strategy to further enhance our competitive position and generate shareholder value. Our strategy is to unlock the true value of FIS by weaving together our extensive digital assets into a global platform that facilitates the rapid adoption of new technology and speeds innovation. 
By componentizing our capabilities, we will expose our unique set of financial assets to the market as well as continue to push new product through this emerging platform. It expands our TAM by positioning FIS as the destination for innovators and developers, where they can get everything they need to create exciting new customer experiences. 
And it helps them to do it faster by providing preconfigured capabilities, low-code and no-code technology, third-party integration as well as sandboxes for experimentation and rapid prototyping, complete with the developer forum. 
Importantly, for our shareholders, it will speed time to revenue for FIS through automation and self-service, while simultaneously creating additional scale benefits by eliminating technology debt. 
This strategy supports our midterm outlook for 7% to 9% revenue growth, 50 to 100 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and superior free cash flow. Our past success demonstrates that we execute major programs very well, and our team will keep FIS at the forefront of the industry by executing the next phase of our enterprise technology transformation. 
As we do this over the next 3 years, you'll hear us talk less and less about segments, as traditional silos and old ways of thinking fade to the background. Instead, we'll begin sharing exciting examples of a new class of super users, who combine technology across the breadth of FIS in new and exciting ways. Each of these super users is buying capabilities from all 3 of our traditional segments, demonstrating a powerful value unlock for FIS. 
Amazon is a great example of the power that our portfolio brings to clients. They started their journey with us by leveraging our nice debit network capabilities a decade ago. Today, they utilize our enterprise acquiring capability for Whole Foods, our global e-commerce capability to enter new online markets and our treasury cash management solution out of Capital Markets. And we've expanded the relationship by leveraging our omnichannel capability to empower their new Amazon 4-star in-store concept internationally, opening its first location in the U.K. 
At FIS, we embrace being a scaled technology leader and look forward to continuing to advance the industry by enabling the next generation of innovative client experiences. 
I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reviewing our capital allocation strategy on Slide 9. Our priority is to deliver long-term growth by investing internally to improve the value we bring to our clients, while expanding our TAM. In parallel, we continue to actively pursue M&A to add innovative new capabilities as well as to enter high-growth adjacencies. 
Our team has a well-established track record of successfully integrating the businesses we acquire, consistently outperforming our synergy targets and driving shareholder value. Through this combination of investments in organic and inorganic opportunities, we have successfully accelerated revenue growth by positioning FIS to deliver innovative solutions in attractive markets where our technology and expertise are highly differentiated. 
The scale and profitability of our business puts us in the enviable position of being able to both invest for growth while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $2 billion in shares, reflecting our view that FIS currently represents a generational buying opportunity. 
We still maintain significant headroom for accelerated share repurchase, with 85 million shares of authorization remaining, and we will buy back stock aggressively. We are committed to consistent dividend growth and are increasing our expected annual dividend growth rate to 20% in 2022 and beyond. 
This will enable us to expand our dividend payout ratio over several years without affecting our ability to invest in growth. Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. This strategy has been consistent for many years, and we will continue to allocate capital to drive robust shareholder returns. 
In conclusion, while competition is intense across our industry, FIS is built for purpose as the leading commerce enablement company. At FIS, we're doing what no one else can, bringing together a unique breadth of capability and global reach to enable our clients to innovate at speed. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and to provide a deep dive into the Merchant segment. Woody?"
10081196,1684497289,2425005,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our third quarter results and touch on our balance sheet, cash flow and guidance before taking you through our additional merchant disclosures. Both reported a",1657,"Thanks, Gary, and thank you all for joining us today. Starting on Slide 11, I will begin with our third quarter results and touch on our balance sheet, cash flow and guidance before taking you through our additional merchant disclosures. 
Both reported and organic revenue growth were 10%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 270 basis points, reflecting high contribution margins and ongoing synergy benefit. 
Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8%, reflecting continued new sales execution. The Banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points to 46% primarily due to ramping revenues from recent large bank wins as well as continued recurring revenue growth. 
Capital Markets revenue growth also accelerated to 11% this quarter primarily due to strong recurring revenue growth as well as 2 points of tailwind created by the timing of client renewals. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 330 basis points to 48%, again reflecting high contribution margins and operating leverage. I'll leave Merchant for now and discuss its quarterly performance with its deep dive later. 
Turning to Slide 12. We generated free cash flow in excess of $1.1 billion in the quarter, representing 33% of revenue or 107% of adjusted net earnings. We tripled the pace of our share buybacks during the quarter, repurchasing 9 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion. While we are aggressively buying stock back right now, we remain active in the M&A market. 
As Gary mentioned, we are increasing our dividend growth rate in 2022 from 10% to 20% per year. We're going to continue to invest for growth, and this will have no impact on our ability or intention to do so. In fact, it will only consume about $100 million of incremental cash during 2022, which is insignificant as compared to our annual free cash flow. To be clear, if our adjusted EPS grows mid-teens and our dividend grows by 20%, we will reach the 35% payout ratio towards the end of this decade. 
On Slide 13, you'll see that we're keeping our full year guidance mostly unchanged after raising it earlier this year. We're increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range to $6.50 from $6.45 per share. We brought up the lower end of our EPS guide due to our operating results and share repurchase during the third quarter. 
To add further color on fourth quarter, consensus revenue and EPS are in line with our expectations. I'm expecting some incremental pressure on margins due to rising labor costs and for this to be offset by lower share count. 
As it pertains to the platform initiatives Gary mentioned, this does not represent incremental investment, but continues the enterprise transformation that we've been executing on for the past 5 years. This is included in our midterm outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth and 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion. As usual, we will provide detailed guidance assumptions in the appendix. 
With that, let's begin the Merchant deep dive on Slide 15. As Gary mentioned, we heard your feedback and are striving to further increase transparency into the Merchant business. I will provide an additional layer of revenue detail and outlook for the business in the next several slides. 
Starting with our third quarter results, Merchant revenue grew 18%, excluding about 4 points of headwind created by the unusual timing of the U.S. tax filing deadline in 2020. Merchant's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 380 basis points to approximately 52%, which reflects the segment's high contribution margins and ongoing synergy benefit. 
Many of our shareholders told us they are evaluating Merchant growth rates versus the comparable period in 2019. Therefore, I will describe growth rates through the rest of this deep dive on that basis as compared to 2019 and pro forma for the Worldpay acquisition. 
It's clear that our business is rebounding, with revenue growth accelerating from 3% in the first quarter to 9% in the second quarter to 16% in the third quarter. On Slide 16, we show how closely our volumes continue to track with the networks. Clearly, the 3 of us don't grow exactly the same every quarter or in every country, but the consistency of FIS' performance relative to the networks throughout the pandemic challenges the bear case in my mind. 
In addition, we included quarterly volume and transaction data within our earnings release going back to the first quarter of 2019. We provide this extra level of transparency to create easy comparisons, so the shareholders can better evaluate any concerns about share loss. 
We provide additional revenue detail by client type on Slide 17. Our global e-commerce business serves web-only merchants. It excludes omnichannel merchant revenue, which is included in enterprise. 
Global e-commerce is our fastest-growing client type and creates a key strategic advantage. Enterprise includes North American merchants with more than $5 million in annual sales volume in the U.K. This is a scale business with meaningful cross-selling opportunities. We have powerful distribution channels and serve marquee brands across both global e-commerce and enterprise, making us the go-to choice for new technology partners striving for adoption. 
Finally, software-led SMB is comprised of U.S. small merchants with less than $5 million in annual sales volume. We service these merchants primarily through software-led or technology-enabled partners who are attracted to our world-class scale and leading enterprise capabilities. 
Moving down this slide, the pie chart show merchants revenue mix by these 3 client types. The text below the pies defines each client type and summarizes our respective strategies for each. Along the bottom of the slide, we show the quarterly revenue growth progression on a pro forma basis as compared to 2019, where the clear takeaway is the [ quick ] recovery thus far. 
The next 3 slides dive deeper, including TAM growth for each client type based on total merchant acquiring TAM from BCG's Global Payments 2021 report. 
Beginning on Slide 18, our global e-commerce business is differentiated by its global reach. We have the unique ability to help leading multinational companies and global brands seamlessly transact around the world. Unlike most of our peers, who gateway domestic card-not-present transactions within various countries, we enable multinational transactions with local licensing to support our clients' global expansion. 
In the upper right-hand corner, we show global e-commerce's estimated TAM growth of 13% to 15% on a revenue basis. Our e-com mix is split roughly 50-50 between the U.S. and international. As you can see, domestic e-com TAM is growing upper single digits, while cross-border TAM is growing 25% to 30%. This is why our global reach is so important. It provides a distinct advantage in the fast-growing area -- fastest growing area of the market. Lastly, SMB e-com TAM is growing 12% to 14%. We don't currently play in this portion of the market and see it as a strategic expansion opportunity. 
As you can see by the elevated growth rates in the lower right corner, FIS is benefiting from the accelerating shift online. Our mix of fast-growing e-com revenue continues to increase, creating the opportunity for us to continue to outpace global merchant acquiring TAM as a whole. 
Turning to Slide 19 to discuss enterprise. Many of our enterprise relationships are decades long and built on sophisticated vertical expertise, such as our unique debit routing, SNAP and WIC capabilities within the grocery vertical. Serving global enterprise clients require significant scale economies to compete at low price points, while quickly and nimbly integrating new technologies. 
Enterprise TAM is growing 4% to 7%, split between the U.S. and international. Within the enterprise, we see the greatest potential for future growth through continued geographic expansion, enabled by our global footprint and international banking relationships. 
Our software-led SMB business is shown on Slide 20. U.S. SMB TAM is growing 7% to 9%. We have experienced significant recovery each quarter this year, with most of our verticals growing 20%-plus during the quarter. 
Restaurant is the notable exception. While it's also demonstrating a strong recovery trend, its growth is slower than other verticals. It's difficult to discern whether this is due to slower reopenings, staffing challenges or the performance of some of our partners. However, our win rates continue to improve on leads given to us by our ISV partners, and we continue to sign new ISV partners, making it clear that there is not a problem with our service. 
Further, our software-led strategy provides significant advantages across the SMB space by providing deep vertical expertise. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that expanding SMB e-com is a significant opportunity for us, especially following the launch of Access Worldpay. In any event, as you can see on Slide 21, it's 2% of our consolidated revenue. 
I'd like to leave you with 2 thoughts before we open the line to Q&A. First, we continue to enjoy significant competitive advantages across the breadth of our business. 65% of our revenue is driven from Banking and Capital Markets with long-term contracts and sticky client relationships. Within the 32% of our revenue mix in Merchant, we are differentiated by our global e-com, enterprise and software-led capabilities. 
While the market appears to be focused on U.S. SMB, which represents a sliver of our revenue, our strategy is about driving growth across the enterprise by enabling digital commerce in every segment and in every vertical, as Gary described. 
Second, on Slide 22, we believe that 8% to 10% TAM growth for the total acquiring market reinforces our outlook for sustained double-digit revenue growth within Merchant. We have a strong e-commerce business that continues to grow as a portion of our overall revenue mix. The international expansion opportunity in enterprise creates additional upside, and we have a really unique opportunity to drive our e-com capabilities downstream into SMB. 
We are confident in the future of FIS, and I would like to thank our colleagues for their continued efforts in serving our clients and driving our business forward.

Just on the Merchant volume and transaction data, you've given us a lot of good stuff here. The lines clearly show you're tracking very well with the network data. 
But I guess, on the revenue side, you do derive revenue both from volume and transactions. So if we want to benchmark revenue against some of those metrics, how would you guide us there? And I think, ultimately, we all want to get a better sense of pricing like-for-like and how that's evolving because mix clearly plays a role."

We've tried to outline both volume growth and transaction growth within the detailed materials in the press release. I think we also gave growth back to 2019 as many of us have been trying to effectively forget 2020 in some levels and ways. 
We have seen volume growth compared to 2019, a track very closely to the networks. We've also see transaction growth slow a little bit in terms of its growth rate, ultimately providing us incremental yield on that volume, which is what we expected and where we expected to continue to track. 
If you look at 2000 -- 2Q 2019 growth of revenue versus the global volume compared to the third quarter, we had about 9 points of incremental yield benefit, and that really takes out kind of the noise between both 2020 and the move shift of the tax movement. 
So that's the one we've been very focused on. But we try to be extremely transparent today to give you every piece of data that we look at and thinking about our revenue growth trajectory."

What we've seen across all markets, all industries is really what we've talked about is more around solutioning and being able to leverage a platform in a way to drive very dynamic outcomes for our customers, and that's what we're all about.  
So as you think about FIS, all large companies are going to have to go through a massive transformation, and so we started that journey 5 years ago. And we now have completed -- completely completed our transition to cloud. 
So we've made that migration, and we're getting all the benefits of the cloud platforms that are available. We then leaned in with next-generation application stacks, and we talked a lot about that through componentization, whether it's Modern Banking Platform, whether it's Payments One, whether it's Digital One, whether it's NAP, the list goes on and on. 
So now the next phase is how do you bring that together and weave that together to a one-stop place for innovators, large conglomerates, anybody looking to take advantage of various capabilities in the open market, and we see it as a huge opportunity. We highlighted just a very small subset of clients already leveraging our next-generation capabilities across all 3 segments.  
You're going to see that grow very dramatically over the next 3 years. You will also continue to see our level of technology debt get displaced, as our existing clients migrate to this framework as well. 
So we're really excited about the future. We highlighted another 2 wins on Modern Banking Platform today. One of those wins was the first customer that has signed up for an existing core banking system of FIS to start transitioning to MBP. 
So as we've talked a lot, we're really at the forefront of this transformation, and this is just the next step in FIS' journey. And we'll continue -- and while we're so confident in our long-term guide of 7% to 9% and mid-teens EPS, and you'll continue to see that resonate in the coming years."

As we've talked about numerous times, there's tremendous operating leverage within the business, as we continue to drive automation and drive efficiencies through normal operations of the business. Incremental revenues have high contribution margins that help with that margin expansion as well. 
With regard to the investment side of it, we've baked in our expectations of investment into that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion. So we feel good about our ability to continue to invest to drive and sustain that accelerated growth profile that we've built out. So yes, Jason, those are the 2 comments I really would think about margin. 
If you think about 2022, we're not updating our formal 2022 guide until February. That said, we're not changing anything in terms of our midterm outlook around 2022 of 7% to 9% revenue growth and 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion.

As you know, we've also been very consistent about getting other large M&A opportunities behind us before we typically move on into other areas. We've talked on prior calls, the market is pricey on certain things, but we're definitely going to continue to lean in on M&A. 
We're going to be a buyer in the market on things that fit our strategy, that expand our TAM, that drive us new product or new capabilities, that drive us in to adjacent market. Anything we do, we will look for things that will accelerate our growth. And so that's going to continue throughout 2021 and 2022 and beyond. So it will always be an important part of our strategy."

Secondly, on your accretion dilution comment around whether we would do something that's dilutive, we don't look at accretion dilution as the only value metric. In fact, we think it's probably just one of many. 
Value creation long term is much more in how we think about M&A, whether it's enhancing our growth profile or filling out gaps strategically into our product portfolio that we can push through our distribution channel. 
So yes, we would think about something potentially dilutive from an accretion dilution analysis, but never that doesn't drive incremental value to shareholders long term."

I'll remind you, we started this journey over -- almost 5 years ago as we started really embracing cloud computing, and then we started really leaning in on next-generation capabilities that I mentioned when I was talking to Tien-Tsin about and all the investments we've made. 
So you're now seeing the results of that. Our pipeline is the fullest -- continues to grow. You're also seeing record quarters being put up by the sales team in record years, year after year. 
This -- if you'll remember in Banking, especially, this journey started well over 3 years ago, and you've seen that growth rate move from low single digits to mid-single digits. And now it's performing consistently in the upper single digits. So we feel great about the business. We feel great about our solution set. 
We -- the TAM is very broad because, obviously, we're not just a domestic player in the U.S. We can expand out into international markets as well in global markets. So we've got a really bright future with this group. And frankly, it's where the industry is moving, more importantly. 
Capital Markets, as I said in my prepared remarks, couldn't be prouder of the team of what they've done. We -- when you go back to 2015, you had a business that was growing negative -- about negative 2%. 
We've repositioned the portfolio. We invested heavily in product and solutioning. We started going -- and we expanded outside of traditional customers because what we found is there was a lot of market that needed those kind of capabilities, and you're now seeing the results. 
That's a very, very clean quarter for Capital Markets. I mean, there was a 2 percentage point tailwind on license renewals. But once again, what a great part of that business is those licenses are term in nature. And so you get those bumps. But even if you adjust that out, just really, really strong results."

And even to the question earlier, we focused on how do we cross-sell. We have this big broad set of assets that we wanted to be able to cross-sell into our client bases. And our teams have really rallied around that. They've done an excellent job of building out the product set, building out how people consume them and put us in a very good position. 
As Gary mentioned, our pipeline has been excellent. Sales execution has been at an all-time high. Yet again, after an all-time high last year, Capital Market is same thing, a lot of is [ pretty crazy ]. 
Probably the other comment I would add is, as we've gone through these projects over the last several years, while our capital was originally on data center consolidation and some of those things, as we've come to a close of those, we're taking that capital and redeploying it in new products and accelerating our new products to meet the challenges of our customers. 
And we stand today very excited about the opportunities to continue to grow, to continue to cross-sell. We see lots of TAM expansion as we're moving into these markets. So we feel very comfortable that we can continue to grow this business at a very healthy clip."

I think -- Darrin, I think at the end of the day, you got to back up a little bit and really look at these businesses and look at the customers they serve. And these customers have traditionally been on older, more legacy technologies. 
And so I've shared for the last several quarters, we're at an inflection point where our clients and our prospects are going to have to start moving and lower their overall total cost of ownership, increase their openness in the way they deliver, increase their speed, which is what Bruce likes to always talk about, the speed at which they serve their customers. And you just can't do that on your historical point-to-point solutions. 
At FIS, we've made the investments to time this shift. And so as you -- now you're seeing the benefits of what that timing is starting to produce. So these are very long-term contracts, are high reoccurring. We're averaging 9- to 12-month sales cycle. We're averaging about 9 months now on an onboarding cycle. Bruce and his team has done a nice job of pulling that back, and that will get faster over time.  
But you're seeing a very different businesses and very different segments positioned very well for a unique inflection point in the industry. And so you will continue to see these segments maintain and grow not only mid, but upper single digits given the nature of what's going on in the markets."

And as that increases, as a percent of revenue, I would think that would be accretive to your revenue yield, right? You should be able to increase that, and there's no reason you shouldn't get back to where you were in 2019, if not higher going forward. Is that the correct assumption?"

I think there's been at least some skepticism that we won't be able to support double-digit Merchant growth for the long term, and we really tried to highlight that, that we do not believe that is the case, with global e-com really helping us drive that accelerated growth longer term and/or to sustain that accelerated growth longer term.
But I think you're right. We continue to see yields coming back as we thought. We think, over time, as everything normalizes out, call it, end of 2022, you'll see those yields where they were pre, with continued double-digit revenue growth within the Merchant business."

The discussion today does not anticipate any incremental CapEx, which I think is supported by my continued free cash flow yield discussion, and that we're not changing anything around free cash flow yields or expectations there. So no incremental CapEx over what we've historically been doing.

We're going to continue to -- I appreciate you pointing out, really, our capital allocation strategy has not changed other than we are raising our dividend starting next year by 20%. But Woody talked through all the financials that it's really immaterial in the overall use of cash. So we've got a very open lens of our free cash flow to either buy companies or continue to buy back our share back. 
And you -- as you saw, we think it's a generational buying opportunity for FIS at the moment. We really leaned in Q3. So -- but we'll continue to look for things that we think can accelerate our growth rate from where we are, keeping in mind that, really, all 3 of our segments are really operating at some of the highest levels in their history. 
I mean, we just -- Q3 was the biggest quarter for Capital Markets and Banking, I think, in its history of this company. And so -- but meanwhile, you see Merchant every trend we'll give you shows that Merchant is heading in the right direction at an accelerated rate over where it was pre-pandemic. 
And it's a very durable business -- all 3 are very durable business model. So if we can find M&A that complements that from a strategy standpoint, that expands that market, drives new TAM, grows us faster, then we absolutely are going to be in -- continue to be in the M&A business."

Woody did a great -- I think a very good job of describing what's going on in our software-led initiatives in SMB specifically. You have seen restaurants starting to recover. I mean, it's a very small overall percentage of our company, so it's really a bit of immaterial at this point in time.
But you have seen it starting to recover. And whether that was due to closures, whether that was due to staffing issues, whether that was due to some of our software partners didn't respond to some of the changing needs as quickly as they might should have during the pandemic, all of that would be open to debate. 
But we feel very good about our software-led strategy within SMB and going to that with partners. The team has done a great job of continuing to sign up partners throughout the pandemic. Bruce just highlighted our sales strength. 
And that's not just in SMB, I mean, our strength in e-com has been fantastic. And what we've seen driving across our e-commerce segment, we've disclosed a lot here on what we're seeing the growth rates going on with and without travel. 
You can actually see travel's improvement Q2 to Q3, which Woody talked about from a domestic standpoint. Now we've got to start leaning into international. But the business is really solid across all of those fronts, and we'll continue to go to the SMB market through our software-led strategy."

As you know, Ash, when we own the consulting company for a number of years and actually didn't see that fit in our overall strategic narrative. 
So we'll continue to partner with large system integrators out there and other large consulting firms. As you can imagine, given the investment we've made in componentization, we have a lot of people wanting to partner with us on that front, which is great. And given the demand we've had, you'll continue to see those partnerships grow, but that's owning another consulting group is not necessary. 
I think Bruce summed it up on a prior question very well, and Woody just confirmed it. If you look at the amount of CapEx that we're investing back into our existing systems, really, right now, it's operating about 8.5% of revenue that's trended up a little bit. Historically, before we started on this journey, as you might remember, it was down in the 4.5% type range. So we trended it up years ago because we saw this coming.
The reality is, as you think about it, this transformation has come in waves, right? We had to embrace the cloud technology to get our cost down, to get our availability up, to get our speed on delivery up. 
You're seeing that in the numbers. You then saw us come on our application wave and really building out within our industry verticals, whether that's NAP, Access Worldpay, whether that's Modern Banking Platform, Payments One, Digital One, whether that's all the things we're doing in Capital Markets around solutioning and really going end to end and front, middle and back office. 
You've now heard us talk about, on this call, we're now waving -- rolling out the next generation of our platform, which is really taking those components and weaving them together in a really way to embrace new markets that we're not serving today. 
So we're still going to be taking advantage of all the markets we're in, driving the kind of growth you're seeing, but now as you weave that in through a platform, as you start bringing in low code and no code environments, as you start bringing in places for innovators to come and incubate, we see that a whole another opportunity to expand TAM given the investments we've made. 
And we don't think that's going to require an increased capital investment at all because as those other programs are closing, that frees up capital to now redeploy. So I think it shows a real confidence in execution. Given where our guide is, it shows a real confidence in the company, and we'll continue to lean in on all those fronts."

I think you've heard us over the last several quarters and really even pre our acquisition of Worldpay that the Worldpay team, and we believe it was the right strategy, continues to focus and invest on e-com and to drive e-com growth even faster. 
If you remember, this 27% of our revenue mix in the highest growing segment,was significantly lower, about 4, 5 points lower than that just a few years ago. So most of our investment in geo expansion, most of our investment in NAP, most of our investment in Access Worldpay, continuing to improve speed of onboarding, capabilities in market and investment in that growth profile, that's absolutely where we've been focusing. 
Further, if you go back to the global e-commerce slide where we talk about it specifically, our mix right now is 50-50 between domestic and cross-border. We think you can also grab some incremental e-commerce market share over time in a pretty high growing SMB market, where we really don't play today.
So yes, that's where a lot of our focus is, is to drive this portion of our revenue mix up significantly, hopefully, over time, getting in as much as 50% of our total revenue mix in these high-growth markets.
