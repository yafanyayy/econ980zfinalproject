And thanks for joining us for our first quarterly earnings call as Viatris. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a strong start with high-quality first quarter results across the board. And this strong performance com",940,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning. And thanks for joining us for our first quarterly earnings call as Viatris. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a strong start with high-quality first quarter results across the board. And this strong performance comes at a time when the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve, taking different courses across the many geographies in which Viatris operates. 
We're grateful to our colleagues around the world who continue to put patients first, ensuring stable access to needed medicines, particularly in India and parts of Latin America, where significant resurgence has impacted our teams there. The health and safety of our colleagues and their families is our highest priority, and we're supporting the continually evolving situation around the globe with urgency, with care and with compassion. 
And for our patients, we're working diligently to bring the medicines they need, including ramping up the production of antiviral medicines remdesivir in India and closely partnering with the government there to ensure access to this critical medicine. 
Back when we launched Viatris in November 2020, our vision was to build a new kind of health care company, differentiated by a global operating platform with significant scale, and commercial capabilities and expertise across science, manufacturing, legal and IP. A broad, diverse product portfolio that includes brands, complex generics and biosimilars and generics, and is agnostic to therapeutic categories, dosage forms and delivery mechanisms, and a strong R&D platform that is well positioned to deliver a broad pipeline of complex novel products including late-stage biosimilar programs. 
Our strong first quarter results validate the success of a diversified and robust business that can absorb headwinds in any individual part of the business while seizing market opportunities where and when they present themselves. In the first quarter, we reported net sales of USD 4.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.6 billion and free cash flow of USD 799 million, which were above our original expectations. These results reflect the strength of our business and were also partially helped by favorable timing of some revenue and expenses and by favorable FX. 
Now let me give you some key highlights for the quarter. The strength of our business was driven by solid performance across all 4 of our commercial segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, Emerging Markets and JANZ, which is Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Excluding the effect of LOEs or loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in Japan and Celebrex in Japan, this quarter, we would have reported 3% growth on actual exchange rate basis or 2% decline on a constant currency basis as compared to the combined LOE adjusted quarter 1 2020 results. 
Lyrica Japan is our last major LOE, and we see no further significant LOEs impacting our business in the coming years. This quarter, we generated USD 163 million in new product revenue to partially offset inherent product erosion, and we're on track to achieve USD 690 million in new product revenue for the full year. We're continuing to shift to more differentiated and sustainable portfolio with strong growth in complex generics and biosimilars and growth of our recently acquired thrombosis franchise in Europe. 
Regarding our pipeline. This quarter, we received notable approvals in Europe for Insulin Aspart and bevacizumab, and we made significant progress on many key pipeline projects, which Rajiv will discuss later in more detail. With regard to the integration of our 2 legacy companies, we are pleased to say our plans are progressing smoothly. This quarter, I also have the opportunity to meet remotely with hundreds of colleagues around the world and I continue to be impressed with the talent, the passion and the engagement that we have at Viatris. We are well on our way to forming as one team and making our performance-driven, highly engaging and inclusive culture a reality. 
And for our shareholders, we're delivering on our commitments. The Viatris Board has declared an overall quarterly dividend of $0.11 a share, consistent was 25% of the midpoint of the 2021 full year free cash flow guidance. We are on track to achieve $500 million in synergies this year. We are on plan and continue to target $6.5 billion in debt repayment by 2023. And we're reporting our first quarter results with the enhanced disclosures and transparency that we previously committed to. 
We're also aware of the interest by our shareholders in the sustainability of our business and our commitment to corporate social responsibility. And sustainability is fundamental to our mission and embedded in everything we do. And I'm pleased to share that we published our inaugural sustainability report as Viatris. More details on that can be found on our website, including a deeper look at Viatris' role in the important fight against COVID-19. 
In closing, we're proud to report a very strong and high-quality first quarter. We're seeing underlying strength in our business and we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2021, which incorporates the known potential headwinds and tailwinds for the remainder of the year. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we will be reassessing whether to update guidance for the full year. And while we're not giving long-term guidance at this time, we continue to feel strongly that 2021 is our trough year as defined by the midpoint of our guidance of USD 6.2 billion adjusted EBITDA. And we believe that, that $6.2 billion is a true floor of our business, not just for this year but also for future years. 
Now with that, let me turn it over to Rajiv to give you more details about our segment results, pipeline progress and restructuring and integration efforts. Rajiv?"

I would like to say hello to our employees around the world and thank them for all of their hard work and commitment to Viatris. I would especially like to recognize my colleagues in France and India and express my deepest sympathies to everyone who is enduring a very difficult situation as the pandemic resurges in the parts of the world. 
Earlier this year, we shared with you our approach to execute our '21 plan, minimizing the base business erosion, executing the new launches, and integrate and synergize. I'm very pleased to inform you that we are off to a great start. I'll be making certain comparisons to combined LOE adjusted quarter 12020 results on a constant currency basis, as well as comparison versus our expectations as included in our full year guidance. 
Beginning on Slide 10. Our business performed better than expectations, but was down 2% in this quarter as compared to combined LOE adjusted quarter 1 2020 results. Our brand business performed better than our expectations driven by products such as EpiPen, Amitiza, Lipitor and Viagra. Our complex generics and biosimilar business grew by 27%, largely driven by biosimilars. And our global generics business performed in line with our expectations. We delivered $163 million for the new launches and remain on track to meet or $690 million target for the year. We continue to expect normalized base business erosion of 3% to 4% for the year. 
Our Developed market Segment performed better than our expectations this quarter. Our brand portfolio performance was driven by higher EpiPen sales in the U.S., largely due to vaccination related buying. [indiscernible], our first nebulized LAMA, performed in line with our expectations, and we are well positioned to expand this market. Our European brand business was helped by Creon, Dymista as well as our thrombosis portfolio acquired from Aspen, highlighting our ability to attractively manage our portfolio of established brands. Our complex generics and biosimilar portfolio grew by 27% in developed markets, largely driven by pegfilgrastin, trastuzumab, as well as adalimumab biosimilars. 
Our generics portfolio performed in line with our expectations once adjusted for COVID surge pine in the first quarter of 2020, which accounts for half of the year-over-year decline. I would like to provide a bit more color around our U.S. generics business, which is approximately 11% of our total business now. Our current generics portfolio is now a combination of diversified product forms, including extended-release oral [ solids, ] injectables, [indiscernible] and topicals. We implemented our disciplined approach to resource allocation and portfolio management, including the rationalization of negative margin products. 
We believe that extending this approach to our overall business will help us match our base business more effectively. Looking ahead, we have assumed increased competition for our complex products like XULANE, Wixela, [indiscernible] in addition to loss of exclusivity outperformance. 
Moving to the next slide. Our emerging market segment performed in line with expectations. Our business was affected by the negative impact of COVID on our lifestyle brands as well as a onetime impact of change in go-to-market strategy in Vietnam. We see our complex generics and biosimilar business growing over the year, driven by a number of new launches in multiple countries. Our Generic business was roughly flat and in line with expectations. Our JANZ segment grew 14% as we adjusted for onetime Lyrica, Celebrex LOEs. Our brand portfolio in Japan had a strong performance driven by Amitiza, Lipitor and Creon. Lyrica LOE is performing to our expectations. We also launched the first adalimumab biosimilar in Japan. Our generics business performed strongly. 
Now to Slide 14. Our Greater China segment performed strongly and grew by 9%. This was primarily driven by 30% growth of our retail channel, better than expected hospital channel performance, as well as the benefits from the COVID recovery. Our retail channel now represents 40% of our China business. We have assumed the full impact of VBP for '21, as well as midyear implementation of URP in southern regions. 
As already mentioned on our guidance call, the trough of our China business will be determined by the timing of the full implementation of ERP. We see continued momentum, and we look forward to investing in our pipeline in this region. Out of 25 products we identified for Greater China, we are well positioned to file 6 regulatory submissions in '21. 
Now switching to providing more details around the impact of the COVID-19. India is currently going through its worst pandemic phase, and we are doing everything possible to protect the health and safety of our employees in India. We are also working closely with the health authorities to maintain supply of remdesivir. We have a broad, diverse and resilient global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. We are not depending on any one country or a site. Even in India, our manufacturing footprint is spread over 5 different states, which mitigates the risk of disruption in any given part of the country. As Viatris, our reliance on India as a supply hub has relatively come down as compared to legacy Mylan. 
The diversity of our network helped us achieve an approximate -- approximately 95% customer service level across the globe last year. We are continuously monitoring our inventories and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
I would now like to share some key updates on our pipeline shared with you on Investor Day. I'll start with our biosimilars franchise on Slide 17. Our [ 351 K ] insulin glargine for interchangeability is on track for a July FDA goal date. Our insulin aspart is also tracking towards its FDA goal date in July and is expected to include interchangeability. We are making steady progress for our biosimilar to BOTOX and recently submitted our briefing package to FDA for agreement on Phase III. 
We have just received top line results for our clinical Phase III study for our biosimilar to EYLEA and are pleased to report that we have met the primary endpoint for this study. We received European approval for the biosimilar to Avastin and insulin aspart. While we no longer have any open scientific questions with FDA, our U.S. approval of biosimilar [indiscernible] has been impacted by the delay in a pre-approval inspection due to COVID travel restrictions. 
The next slide shows our complex product pipeline. For our Glatiramer once monthly, we have dosed more than 900 patients and are on track for our submission at the end of 2022. We also achieved positive results in Phase II trial for meloxicam, which was designed as a proof-of-concept study for a quicker onset of acute pain relief as an alternative to opioids. We are excited that we have advanced a new low-dose formulation of XULANE, which we formerly called MR100. We are expecting this product to be one of the smallest low-dose patches in its class and our Phase III clinical trial has been initiated. 
The next slide shows our continued progress in our complex injectable pipeline. Our octreotide MR injection clinical study is well underway to support our U.S. submission. Clinical study for [ EU TRINZA ] are on track for quarter 2 2021. We are also in the process of initiating clinical studies for amphotericin B, previously called MR118. 
I'll finish with an update on our integration and restructuring program. As you can see on Slide 21, we remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies this year. Our workforce actions are well underway, including a recently announced voluntary retirement program in Japan, which is on schedule. As we announced earlier this year, the rationalization of 13 manufacturing sites have been identified and closure or divestiture equities are in process. We are working very closely with regulators and our customers to avoid any supply disruptions and are building appropriate safety stocks. 
With all of these actions underway, we remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion in cumulative cost savings by 2023. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."

As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we're off to a strong start, and I'll walk you through the key drivers and how we see certain trends shaping up for the rest of the year. As you will see in coming slides, I'll make",884,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we're off to a strong start, and I'll walk you through the key drivers and how we see certain trends shaping up for the rest of the year. 
As you will see in coming slides, I'll make comparison to prior year Mylan stand-alone combined adjusted as well as our 2021 expectations. On Slide 23, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's stand-alone results for quarter 1 2020. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA benefited from contributions of Amgen branded products and the strength of China, which was driven by stable sales in hospital business and retail growth, including COVID recovery. In total, these factors led to a significant increase in financial strength, including profitability and cash flow generation. 
Moving to Slide 24. I have highlighted the drivers in the quarter compared to combined adjusted Q1 2020 results. As a reminder, this chart reflects the sum of Mylan's stand-alone results and Upjohn [indiscernible] Financial for a period of January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020, adjusted for certain transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with combination. A few key comments on this chart. Beginning with LOEs, as Rajiv mentioned, Generic penetration is tracking in line with our expectation and year-on-year Lyrica and Celebrex in Japan are down by $206 million. 
COVID continues to negatively impact our business as a result of lower volumes across many of key markets, particularly Europe, where we saw pre-COVID surge buying last year and to a lesser extent in the U.S. In China, we saw favorable impact due to COVID recovery. While we're still anticipating a gradual recovery beginning in the second half, the recovery is likely to be slower across some emerging markets. Base business erosion was driven by normal price erosion and volume declines in U.S., Europe and Emerging Market. And for rest of the year, we still forecast the erosion of about 3% to 4%. 
We're off to a good start with new products. Revenue was primarily driven by European Thrombosis business, which grew versus prior year an additional uptick of complex generic and biosimilars. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, it's important to remember, approximately 70% of our business is outside the U.S. In the quarter, the weaker dollars relative to key currencies such as euro, Chinese RMB provided approximately 5% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 revenue results. 
Moving forward, if rate remains at the current level, we expect a continued tailwind from foreign exchange, consistent with full year guidance, but not to the level realized in quarter 1. Moving to Slide 25, which bridges adjusted EBITDA. The year-on-year margin is declining because of item listed on the bridge. As you will recall from our 2021 financial guidance bridge, we were impacted by lower depreciation and amortization associated with Pfizer TSA, which negatively impacts EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 26. Free cash flow came in above our expectations, driven by strong operating performance, benefits from working capital improvement initiatives, and timing of onetime cost and CapEx. For the quarter, onetime cash costs were approximately $340 million, primarily related to integration cost in TSA startup. For quarter 2, we expect both to increase over Q1 levels. 
With respect to cash flow phasing, we expect Q2 cash flow to be significantly reduced versus Q1 and expect it to be our lowest for the year. The decline is driven by expected increase in onetime cash cost, interest payments, which occur semiannually in Q2 and Q4 and increasing capital expenditures. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Strong cash flow allowed us to pay down approximately $1 billion in short-term debt. We anticipate that Q2 short-term debt will increase as a result of June maturity of $2.25 billion final payment of European Thrombosis business and the quarterly dividend. From a capital deployment standpoint, we declared our first quarterly dividend, which is consistent with our guidance framework. We do not expect the $0.11 per share amount to change for subsequent quarters in 2021, but all future dividend declarations are subject to approval. Overall, we remain on track with our 2021 free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
Moving to Slide 28. As you heard from Michael earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2021 guidance ranges based on a strong start we saw in Q1, balanced by expected headwinds for the remainder of the year. In terms of revenue phasing, we expect Q2 2021 to be roughly in line with Q1 2021 due to modest recovery from COVID in Europe, continued strong performance in China, offset by expected negative impact of LOEs, competition and more normalized EpiPen sales. 
Going forward, these items will pressure our gross margin to be more in line with our guidance range. As we look out to Q2, we expect SG&A to be in line with Q1 on an absolute basis. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A to be within our previously indicated range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Given these dynamics, it is likely that Q1 will be highest adjusted EBITDA quarter. Overall, I'm really pleased with the execution in this quarter and the commitment we delivered against, including the initiation of dividend. 
With that, let me open the call to Q&A. Operator?"

Could you just maybe talk a little bit more in detail about some of the working capital initiatives that you've undertaken? How they impacted first quarter results and then maybe just a little bit of color commentary on how working capital trends performed in the quarter versus your expectation? And just a quick clarification. You highlight $315 million in restructuring costs in the deck. And I think the guidance was originally for $450 million for the full year. Just want to make sure that the remaining cash flow drag related to restructuring is only $135 million for the balance of the year. I'm not sure if there's other items that I should be thinking about, but just some clarification on that item."

So there are a couple of questions in that. So let me take them 0 by one. So first off, we're very pleased with the cash flow generation in the business. Specifically talking about net working capital, there are 2 thin",400,"Elliot, thank you for your question. So there are a couple of questions in that. So let me take them 0 by one. So first off, we're very pleased with the cash flow generation in the business. Specifically talking about net working capital, there are 2 things going on. One is on the positive side, which is the initiative we're taking as a company. When you bring 2 companies together, managing our receivables, our payables and inventory. So that created an upside of roughly about $65 million in this quarter, and that's going to continue to be -- we continue to build on that. So that's clearly a positive. On other side, on the net working capital from operations, we did [ little bit ] have a timing benefit we were able to accelerate certain collections in Europe in this quarter, which actually helped us and will have an impact on the second quarter. But overall, we're very pleased and I expect the net working capital improvement initiative to continue to help us for the rest of the year. 
Coming to the kind of phasing, as I mentioned about on the cash flow. Second quarter, as I said, would be significantly lower. Our net working capital requirement for second quarter will go up, Elliot, because a couple of things going on, particularly about our debt -- interest and debt, it's about $200 million we'll be paying in second quarter, which is only paid in second and fourth quarter. So there is a quarter-to-quarter variation that is happening, but we are very pleased with that. 
With regard to your second question about $350 million, as we have in our disclosures, it's a combination of 2 items. One is the restructuring, which is related to the unabsorbed overhead of the 13 plants that we've got announced, including Morgantown. And then the second part of that is about the severance. That's across the board based on the initiative that we've taken on the synergy part. So that's in line with our expectation. And the comment that you made about $400 million, that was on the onetime cost as part of the $1.5 billion. So all in line, what you see in this quarter is in line with $1.5 billion and then it's a combination of 2 items, which is the severance cost and the restructuring cost, which is all part of $1.5 billion."

We have come to a point where we're just seeking the agreement on basically both the [indiscernible] as well as the clinical program. So we have enough data now to go back and share with them before we move on. So we are at a critical stage of this. And I see -- I'm very optimistic about this program as we roll on."

Now the second question was about the complex and biosimilar categories, the current markets. The biosimilars are key contributors to this growth, driven by the launch over the last year -- or excuse me, year-over-year. Trastuzumab, backfill drafting, Hulio growing in -- Hulio growing in -- especially in Germany. And us launching these biosimilars also between Australia and Canada and many of these European markets.

Overall, pricing trends are very similar to what we had expected of mid-single digit. If you -- if I correct it for COVID, because if you remember, Balaji, last year, Q1 was when the COVID impacted and there were some last 50 days surge buying on some of the products. If I correct it, U.S. generics are roughly around 4% decline year-over-year, very much in line with what we had expected. 
So -- and specifically from a U.S. point of business point of view, we have healthy inventories in the channel. We have strong customer service levels and believe our diversified portfolio or new launches and steady supply is being appreciated by the customer. So we feel very good about our -- this 11% part of the business also. Now coming back to India. Last year was no different. 5 months almost, Balaji, if you remember, India was in complete lockdown from March onwards to almost up to July or August. There were 4, 5 months of complete lockdown. We closed about 95%, 96% of our customer service level over the period. Specifically regarding to Biocon, we are working very closely with Biocon. And at this point of time, where we stand, I don't see any issue. 
If I look -- if I forward look, we are keeping our eyes to the ground. We are staying close with our customers. We are working closely with the regulators. We're trying everything to take care of our employees, especially the frontline employees. So Yes, India is important. And at the same point of time, what Mylan legacy -- the way Mylan legacy was depending upon India, I think our dependence as a new company veterans is very different now on India. So I think all in all, it's tough, it's challenging over there, but we feel good where we stand from a supply point of view."

In China, for example, has been actually headwinds because we compare this quarter to a very low first quarter last year because COVID started there first. We see other regions slowly recovering mostly due to vaccinations and then we see countries getting worse, like India or Latin America. 
So I think what we can say overall at this point, we're reaffirming our guidance.

And I think you saw us do that in quarter 1. 
You also see the strength of quarter 1 being in all 4 of our commercial segments, in all 3 of our categories, whether it's brand, generics or complex generics and biosimilars. And we've been, I think, very transparent what part of that is due to timing, what part of that is due to FX and what part of it is real underlying business performance. But it's also just 1 quarter. So what we're saying is, at this point, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. We're very confident in that. That applies to revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. We're confident we're delivering on our commitments. 
And as we would a regular course of business do, we'll look at it again after the second quarter and then update the guidance at that point. So that's what that comment is. On the question you have on Organon, I think it's very clear that we're very pleased with this because it's a real positive for investors to have another company to add as a comparable to our newly created peer set. But we are obviously focused on running Viatris, 100% focused on that. And we're excited about the differentiated platform that we have. And let me give you some of that differentiation. One, we have a truly global operating platform, one that has significant scale, significant commercial capabilities, expertise across science and manufacturing with legal and IP. 
Very importantly, we've got a broad and diverse product portfolio that includes brands, complex and biosimilars and generics. And that is as important is agnostic to any particular therapeutic area, so in particular, dosage form and in particular, delivery mechanism. And that gives us robustness and opportunities going forward. And we're very proud of the strong R&D that we have, that really positions us well to deliver a broad pipeline of complex and novel products, including the late-stage biosimilars. You saw some of the progress we made on the pipeline just this quarter. So that's what I would comment there.

For the U.S. and Europe, this market -- these products are commoditized. They are steady eddy, whatever is left is steady teddy that these are for reasons they're called iconic brands. So there's still brand share they command in some of these markets. So we have seen over the last 3, 4, 5 years, there's a pretty steady business, not much erosion there. 
Emerging markets are still they're the iconic brands, and there's a getting for these brands. People are looking for these iconic names. And these are the branded generic market per se, the health care environment as the consumerism is growing, as spend on the health care cost is growing, we see the opportunity over there. Many of these markets, there is a mixed bag, but the growing emerging markets, we sometimes call them between us. This is where we see some opportunity over there. You've seen [indiscernible], once you lose it -- you have an LOE, there's a combination of retaining some of the brand business and the AG business. That kicks in for us. 
We have a pretty effective weapon in terms of authorizing [indiscernible] to retain our market share in markets like Japan, especially Japan. And you are already seeing the value of iconic brand and how much equity they can hold in a retail channel like China. So per se, we are not very much -- overall, if I have to say, we are not very much concerned about the competition coming in from generics to this brand. I think we have factored in the way we are managing this business is at a very granular level, not one global approach, but a country-by-country approach."

But the one thing I do want to highlight though is the Thrombosis business was always part of the number we gave you for the pipeline, so that's in line with expectations. And I think the important thing that I would like to highlight for this quarter is that we are growing that business on a like-for-like basis. So that, I think, shows the strength of what we can bring to a business like this that we take over. Rajiv?"

Now obviously, when you have a portfolio of products, some products can be little bit delayed, somebody -- some products better perform better than expectations. We remain very confident that we're going to achieve $690 million despite we are seeing a little bit delays in some inspections in India, for example. As Biocon called out, the bevazuzimab biosimilar. But it's not going to impact us materially from the numbers point of view [indiscernible] sitting over here. We just got approval in -- of [indiscernible] in Australia. So approvals are picking in from all over the rest of the world.

First, on China, how much of the -- like the revs in the quarter were from FX? And I asked because the pie charts you showed earlier this year kind of implied about $1.75 billion in Chinese revenues this year. And I think like the run rate now is a good bit above that. So is this just an FX issue or is this like need to be adjusted downward for additional pressures from like BBP and URP coming in the back half of the year? And then secondly, on EBITDA growth. If I use your starting debt this year, the midpoint of your guide and your debt paydown guidance and your leverage goal and I put those things together. It kind of implies to me that you're looking at a 2023 EBITDA figure somewhere between like [ 6 8 ] and [ 6 9. ] Given you're going to get another $500 million in synergies over '22 and '23, that would imply organic EBITDA growth somewhere in the like $100 million to $200 million range. So pretty flat on that item. Is that the right way to think about it? And are there other levers you can pull to change how this would look in out here?"

Chinese RMB, which was RMB 7 to $1 is roughly at 6.5% this time. So there's obviously a tailwind coming from the FX. But operationally as well, Greater China has done well. Part of it is driven by the fact last year we were impacted by COVID big way in products like Viagra, we're doing better this quarter. But again, operationally, as Rajiv pointed out in his comment, we're doing well. So that's the answer to China question.

Two questions, if you don't mind, product specific. First, about the interchangeability for glargine and aspart, so first that will obviously be quite an achievement being the first biosimilars approved is interchangeable. I guess the question I have is about the commercial levers that you can play here. It seems that the payer market is somewhat locked by the competitors, at least that's what they're suggesting. I was wondering if you do have some levers in the channel that interchangeability gives you that will allow you to leverage those products? And should we expect that in '21 or is this more for '22, 2023 contributor? 
And second, regarding botulinum toxin biosimilar, the requirements in the guidance talks about characterizing the quarter structure and the post consolation modification across multiple batches, which seems to be very hard in the case of botulinum toxin. I was kind of wondering if you actually just met those or has the FDA simply established more functional guidelines for the botulinum toxin just given the very small amount of product in every sample."

But it's not where we want to be. 
So that's going to give us an optionality and opportunity to look into this product in a very different way and essentially relaunch the product as we go further. Now on from the BOTOX point of view, you're right. This is where I think the FDA's guidance and thinking continues to evolve as we keep on sharing with them the information. It's just nothing different than what happened on Advair. When you continue to interact with the FDA between the -- from the science point of view, the challenges you have, what's achievable, what's not achievable.

So you can absolutely expect us to be very active in the space, but consistent with our capital allocation priorities. In terms of focus areas, I want to maybe highlight four. One is established brands within our therapeutic categories or established channels that we have that are synergistic to that. You've seen what we can do with the Thrombosis franchise, for example, where we take it and improve on it. Biosimilars, clearly a focus area for us. China is a focus area for us.

Clearly, the other thing important to note is quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be variability. As I said, quarter 2, the onetime cost is going to be higher because of a lot of the tax and legal settlements that are happening in quarter 2. But overall, for the full year, we expect that to be around $1.5 billion. Going forward, again, not giving the guidance, and I think the simple way to think about this is, by the end of third year, I expect the $1.5 billion to be down significantly to the level that legacy Mylan used to be, which was I think in 2017, 2018 used to be about $500 million. So as you can see, the trajectory is going to come down significantly next year. And obviously, when we provide the 2022 guidance, we'll let you know about the exact amount."

And this strong performance com",940,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning. And thanks for joining us for our first quarterly earnings call as Viatris. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a strong start with high-quality first quarter results across the board. And this strong performance comes at a time when the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve, taking different courses across the many geographies to which Viatris operates. 
We're grateful to our colleagues around the world who continue to put patients first, ensuring stable access to needed medicines, particularly in India and parts of Latin America, where significant resurgence has impacted our teams there. The health and safety of our colleagues and their families is our highest priority, and we're supporting the continually evolving situation around the globe with urgency, with care and with compassion. 
And for our patients, we're working diligently to bring the medicines they need, including ramping up the production of antiviral medicines remdesivir in India and closely partnering with the government there to ensure access to this critical medicine. 
Back when we launched Viatris in November 2020, our vision was to build a new kind of health care company, differentiated by a global operating platform with significant scale, and commercial capabilities and expertise across science, manufacturing, legal and IP. A broad, diverse product portfolio that includes brands, complex generics and biosimilars and generics, and is agnostic to therapeutic categories, dosage forms and delivery mechanisms, and a strong R&D platform that is well positioned to deliver a broad pipeline of complex novel products, including late-stage biosimilar programs. 
Our strong first quarter results validate the success of a diversified and robust business that can absorb headwinds in any individual part of the business while seizing market opportunities where and when they present themselves. In the first quarter, we reported net sales of USD 4.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.6 billion and free cash flow of USD 799 million, which were above our original expectations. These results reflect the strength of our business and were also partially helped by favorable timing of some revenue and expenses and by favorable FX. 
Now let me give you some key highlights for the quarter. The strength of our business was driven by solid performance across all 4 of our commercial segments: Developed Markets, Greater China, Emerging Markets and JANZ, which is Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Excluding the effect of LOEs or loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in Japan and Celebrex in Japan, this quarter, we would have reported 3% growth on actual exchange rate basis or 2% decline on a constant currency basis as compared to the combined LOE adjusted quarter 1 2020 results. 
Lyrica Japan is our last major LOE, and we see no further significant LOEs impacting our business in the coming years. This quarter, we generated USD 163 million in new product revenue to partially offset inherent product erosion, and we're on track to achieve USD 690 million in new product revenue for the full year. We're continuing to shift to more differentiated and sustainable portfolio with strong growth in complex generics and biosimilars and growth of our recently acquired thrombosis franchise in Europe. 
Regarding our pipeline. This quarter, we received notable approvals in Europe for Insulin Aspart and bevacizumab, and we made significant progress on many key pipeline projects, which Rajiv will discuss later in more detail. With regard to the integration of our 2 legacy companies, we are pleased to say our plans are progressing smoothly. This quarter, I also have the opportunity to meet remotely with hundreds of colleagues around the world and I continue to be impressed with the talent, the passion and the engagement that we have at Viatris. We are well on our way to forming as one team and making our performance-driven, highly engaging and inclusive culture a reality. 
And for our shareholders, we're delivering on our commitments. The Viatris Board has declared an overall quarterly dividend of $0.11 a share, consistent was 25% of the midpoint of the 2021 full year free cash flow guidance. We are on track to achieve $500 million in synergies this year. We are on plan and continue to target $6.5 billion in debt repayment by 2023. And we're reporting our first quarter results with the enhanced disclosures and transparency that we previously committed to. 
We're also aware of the interest by our shareholders in the sustainability of our business and our commitment to corporate social responsibility. And sustainability is fundamental to our mission and embedded in everything we do. And I'm pleased to share that we published our inaugural sustainability report as Viatris. More details on that can be found on our website, including a deeper look at Viatris' role in the important fight against COVID-19. 
In closing, we're proud to report a very strong and high-quality first quarter. We're seeing underlying strength in our business and we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance for 2021, which incorporates the known potential headwinds and tailwinds for the remainder of the year. At the conclusion of the second quarter, we will be reassessing whether to update guidance for the full year. And while we're not giving long-term guidance at this time, we continue to feel strongly that 2021 is our trough year as defined by the midpoint of our guidance of USD 6.2 billion adjusted EBITDA. And we believe that, that $6.2 billion is a true floor of our business, not just for this year but also for future years. 
Now with that, let me turn it over to Rajiv to give you more details about our segment results, pipeline progress and restructuring and integration efforts. Rajiv?"

I would especially like to recognize my colleagues in France and India and express my deepest sympathies to everyone who is enduring a very difficult situation as the pandemic resurges in the parts of the world. 
Earlier this year, we shared with you our approach to execute our '21 plan, minimizing the base business erosion, executing the new launches, and integrate and synergize. I'm very pleased to inform you that we are off to a great start. I'll be making certain comparisons to combined LOE adjusted quarter 1 2020 results on a constant currency basis, as well as comparison versus our expectations as included in our full year guidance. 
Beginning on Slide 10. Our business performed better than expectations, but was down 2% in this quarter as compared to combined LOE adjusted quarter 1 2020 results. Our brand business performed better than our expectations driven by products such as EpiPen, Amitiza, Lipitor and Viagra. Our complex generics and biosimilar business grew by 27%, largely driven by biosimilars. And our global generics business performed in line with our expectations. We delivered $163 million for the new launches and remain on track to meet our $690 million target for the year. We continue to expect normalized base business erosion of 3% to 4% for the year. 
Our developed market segment performed better than our expectations this quarter. Our brand portfolio performance was driven by higher EpiPen sales in the U.S., largely due to vaccination related buying. Yupelri, our first nebulized LAMA, performed in line with our expectations, and we are well positioned to expand this market. Our European brand business was helped by Creon, Dymista as well as our thrombosis portfolio acquired from Aspen, highlighting our ability to attractively manage our portfolio of established brands. Our complex generics and biosimilar portfolio grew by 27% in developed markets, largely driven by pegfilgrastin, trastuzumab as well as adalimumab biosimilars. 
Our generics portfolio performed in line with our expectations once adjusted for COVID surge pine in the first quarter of 2020, which accounts for half of the year-over-year decline. I would like to provide a bit more color around our U.S. generics business, which is approximately 11% of our total business now. Our current generics portfolio is now a combination of diversified product forms, including extended-release oral solids, injectables, transdermals and topicals. We implemented our disciplined approach to resource allocation and portfolio management, including the rationalization of negative margin products. 
We believe that extending this approach to our overall business will help us manage our base business more effectively. Looking ahead, we have assumed increased competition for our complex products like XULANE, Wixela, glatiramer acetate in addition to the loss of exclusivity of performance. 
Moving to the next slide. Our emerging market segment performed in line with expectations. Our business was affected by the negative impact of COVID on our lifestyle brands as well as a onetime impact of change in go-to-market strategy in Vietnam. We see our complex generics and biosimilar business growing over the year, driven by a number of new launches in multiple countries. Our Generic business was roughly flat and in line with expectations. Our JANZ segment grew 14% as we adjusted for onetime Lyrica, Celebrex LOEs. Our brand portfolio in Japan had a strong performance driven by Amitiza, Lipitor and Creon. Lyrica LOE is performing to our expectations. We also launched the first adalimumab biosimilar in Japan. Our generics business performed strongly. 
Now to Slide 14. Our Greater China segment performed strongly and grew by 9%. This was primarily driven by 30% growth of our retail channel, better than expected hospital channel performance as well as the benefits from the COVID recovery. Our retail channel now represents 40% of our China business. We have assumed the full impact of VBP for '21, as well as midyear implementation of URP in southern regions. 
As already mentioned on our guidance call, the trough of our China business will be determined by the timing of the full implementation of URP. We see continued momentum, and we look forward to investing in our pipeline in this region. Out of 25 products we identified for Greater China, we are well positioned to file 6 regulatory submissions in '21. 
Now switching to providing more details around the impact of the COVID-19. India is currently going through its worst pandemic phase, and we are doing everything possible to protect the health and safety of our employees in India. We are also working closely with the health authorities to maintain supply of remdesivir. We have a broad, diverse and resilient global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. We are not depending on any one country or a site. Even in India, our manufacturing footprint is spread over 5 different states, which mitigates the risk of disruption in any given part of the country. As Viatris, our reliance on India as a supply hub has relatively come down as compared to legacy Mylan. 
The diversity of our network helped us achieve an approximate -- approximately 95% customer service level across the globe last year. We are continuously monitoring our inventories and currently are in a strong position from a supply point of view to meet our customer needs across the globe. 
I would now like to share some key updates on our pipeline shared with you on Investor Day. I'll start with our biosimilars franchise on Slide 17. Our 351k insulin glargine for interchangeability is on track for our July FDA goal date. Our insulin aspart is also tracking towards its FDA goal date in July and is expected to include interchangeability. We are making steady progress for our biosimilar to BOTOX and recently submitted our briefing package to FDA for agreement on Phase III. 
We have just received top line results for our clinical Phase III study for our biosimilar to EYLEA and are pleased to report that we have met the primary endpoint for this study. We received European approval for the biosimilar to Avastin and insulin aspart. While we no longer have any open scientific questions with FDA, our U.S. approval of biosimilar to Avestin has been impacted by the delay in a pre-approval inspection due to COVID travel restrictions. 
The next slide shows our complex product pipeline. For our Glatiramer acetate once monthly, we have dosed more than 900 patients and are on track for our submission at the end of 2022. We also achieved positive results in Phase II trial for meloxicam, which was designed as a proof-of-concept study for a quicker onset of acute pain relief as an alternative to opioids. We are excited that we have advanced a new low-dose formulation of XULANE, which we formerly call MR100. We are expecting this product to be one of the smallest low-dose patches in its class and our Phase III clinical trial has been initiated. 
The next slide shows our continued progress in our complex injectable pipeline. Our octreotide MR injection clinical study is well underway to support our U.S. submission. Clinical study for EU TRINZA are on track for quarter 2 2021. We are also in the process of initiating clinical studies for amphotericin B, previously called MR118. 
I'll finish with an update on our integration and restructuring program. As you can see on Slide 21, we remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies this year. Our workforce actions are well underway, including a recently announced voluntary retirement program in Japan, which is on schedule. As we announced earlier this year, the rationalization of 13 manufacturing sites have been identified and closure or divestiture equities are in process. We are working very closely with regulators and our customers to avoid any supply disruptions and are building appropriate safety stocks. 
With all of these actions underway, we remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion in cumulative cost savings by 2023. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."

As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we're off to a strong start, and I'll walk you through the key drivers and how we see certain trends shaping up for the rest of the year. As you will see in coming slides, I'll make",885,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we're off to a strong start, and I'll walk you through the key drivers and how we see certain trends shaping up for the rest of the year. 
As you will see in coming slides, I'll make comparison to prior year Mylan stand-alone combined adjusted as well as our 2021 expectations. On Slide 23, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's stand-alone results for quarter 1 2020. Adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA benefited from contributions of Amgen branded products and the strength of China, which was driven by stable sales in hospital business and retail growth, including COVID recovery. In total, these factors led to a significant increase in financial strength, including profitability and cash flow generation. 
Moving to Slide 24. I have highlighted the drivers in the quarter compared to combined adjusted Q1 2020 results. As a reminder, this chart reflects the sum of Mylan's stand-alone results and Upjohn [ Combined ] Financial for a period of January 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020, adjusted for certain transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with combination. A few key comments on this chart. Beginning with LOEs. As Rajiv mentioned, Generic penetration is tracking in line with our expectation and year-on-year Lyrica and Celebrex in Japan are down by $206 million. 
COVID continues to negatively impact our business as a result of lower volumes across many of key markets, particularly Europe, where we saw pre-COVID surge buying last year and to a lesser extent, in the U.S. In China, we saw favorable impact due to COVID recovery. While we're still anticipating a gradual recovery beginning in the second half, the recovery is likely to be slower across some emerging markets. Base business erosion was driven by normal price erosion and volume declines in U.S., Europe and Emerging Market. And for rest of the year, we still forecast erosion of about 3% to 4%. 
We're off to a good start with new products. Revenue was primarily driven by European Thrombosis business, which grew versus prior year, an additional uptick of complex generic and biosimilars. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, it's important to remember, approximately 70% of our business is outside the U.S. In the quarter, the weaker dollars relative to key currencies such as euro, Chinese RMB provided approximately 5% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 revenue results. 
Moving forward, if rate remains at the current level, we expect a continued tailwind from foreign exchange consistent with full year guidance, though not to the level realized in quarter 1. Moving to Slide 25, which bridges adjusted EBITDA. The year-on-year margin is declining because of item listed on the bridge. As you will recall from our 2021 financial guidance bridge, we were impacted by lower depreciation and amortization associated with Pfizer TSA, which negatively impacts EBITDA. 
Turning to Slide 26. Free cash flow came in above our expectations, driven by strong operating performance, benefits from working capital improvement initiatives, and timing of onetime cost and CapEx. For the quarter, onetime cash costs were approximately $340 million, primarily related to integration cost in TSA startup. For quarter 2, we expect both to increase over Q1 levels. 
With respect to cash flow phasing. We expect Q2 cash flow to be significantly reduced versus Q1 and expect it to be our lowest for the year. The decline is driven by expected increase in onetime cash cost, interest payments, which occur semiannually in Q2 and Q4 and increasing capital expenditures. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Strong cash flow allowed us to pay down approximately $1 billion in short-term debt. We anticipate that Q2 short-term debt will increase as a result of June maturity of $2.25 billion final payment of European Thrombosis business and the quarterly dividend. From a capital deployment standpoint, we declared our first quarterly dividend, which is consistent with our guidance framework. We do not expect the $0.11 per share amount to change for subsequent quarters in 2021, but all future dividend declarations are subject to approval. Overall, we remain on track with our 2021 free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
Moving to Slide 28. As you heard from Michael earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2021 guidance ranges based on a strong start we saw in Q1, balanced by expected headwinds for the remainder of the year. In terms of revenue phasing, we expect Q2 2021 to be roughly in line with Q1 2021 due to modest recovery from COVID in Europe, continued strong performance in China, offset by expected negative impact of LOEs, competition and more normalized EpiPen sales. 
Going forward, these items will pressure our gross margin to be more in line with our guidance range. As we look out to Q2, we expect SG&A to be in line with Q1 on an absolute basis. On a full year basis, we expect SG&A to be within our previously indicated range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Given these dynamics, it is likely that Q1 will be highest adjusted EBITDA quarter. Overall, I'm really pleased with the execution in this quarter and the commitment we delivered against, including the initiation of dividend. 
With that, let me open the call to Q&A. Operator?"

Could you just maybe talk a little bit more in detail about some of the working capital initiatives that you've undertaken? How they impacted first quarter results, and then maybe just a little bit of color commentary on how working capital trends performed in the quarter versus your expectation. And just a quick clarification. You highlight $315 million in restructuring costs in the deck. And I think the guidance was originally for $450 million for the full year. Just want to make sure that the remaining cash flow drag related to restructuring is only $135 million for the balance of the year. I'm not sure if there's other items that I should be thinking about, but just some clarification on that item."

So first off, we're very pleased with the cash flow generation in the business. Specifically talking about net working capital, there are 2 things going on. One is on the positive side, which is the initiative we're taking as a company when you bring 2 companies together, managing our receivables, our payables and inventory. So that created an upside of roughly about $65 million in this quarter, and that's going to continue to be -- we continue to build on that. So that's clearly a positive. On other side, on the net working capital from operations, we did little bit have a timing benefit. We were able to accelerate certain collections in Europe in this quarter, which actually helped us and will have an impact on the second quarter. But overall, we're very pleased and I expect the net working capital improvement initiative to continue to help us for the rest of the year. 
Coming to the kind of phasing, as I mentioned about on the cash flow. Second quarter, as I said, would be significantly lower. Our net working capital requirement for second quarter will go up, Elliot, because a couple of things going on, particularly about our debt -- interest and debt, it's about $200 million we'll be paying in second quarter, which is only paid in second and fourth quarter. So there is a quarter-to-quarter variation that is happening, but we are very pleased with that. 
With regard to your second question about $350 million. As we have in our disclosures, it's a combination of 2 items. One is the restructuring, which is related to the unabsorbed overhead of the 13 plants that we've got announced, including Morgantown. And then the second part of that is about the severance. That's, across the board, based on the initiative that we've taken on the synergy part. So that's in line with our expectation. And then the comment that you made about $400 million, that was on the onetime cost as part of the $1.5 billion. So all in line, what you see in this quarter is in line with $1.5 billion and then it's a combination of 2 items, which is the severance cost and the restructuring cost, which is all part of $1.5 billion."

But there's a little bit of employer-based sort of health care -- when you have their health care support. That's a little bit of still where the payers are involved. I can give you exactly what percentage is of that, but it's predominantly the cash base. 
Now second question on the BOTOX. Our program is moving on. Very well aligned with our partner, Revance. We had laid out -- we had gone and met FDA a couple of times. We understand their expectations. We have come to a point where we're just seeking the agreement on basically both the biosimilarity as well as the clinical program.

The U.S. as Michael said, 11% of our total business, diversified mix between the -- even within the generics, if we said select or extended release tablets, as I mentioned. A lot of injectables, a lot of batches and topicals. Overall, pricing trends are very similar to what we had expected of mid-single digit. If you -- if I correct it for COVID, because if you remember, Balaji, last year, Q1 was when the COVID impacted and there were some last 50 days surge buying on some of the products. If I correct it, U.S. generics are roughly around 4% decline year-over-year, very much in line with what we had expected. 
So -- and specifically from a U.S. point of -- business point of view, we have healthy inventories in the channel. We have strong customer service levels and believe our diversified portfolio or new launches and steady supply is being appreciated by the customer. So we feel very good about our -- this 11% part of the business also. Now coming back to India. Last year was no different. Five months almost, Balaji, if you remember, India was in complete lockdown from March onwards to almost up to July or August. There were 4, 5 months of complete lockdown. We closed about 95%, 96% of our customer service level over the period. Specifically regarding to Biocon, we are working very closely with Biocon. And at this point of time, where we stand, I don't see any issue. 
If I look -- if I forward look, we are keeping our eyes to the ground. We are staying close with our customers. We are working closely with the regulators. We're trying everything to take care of our employees, especially the frontline employees. So yes, India is important. And at the same point of time, what Mylan legacy -- the way Mylan legacy was depending upon India, I think our dependence as a new company, Viatris is very different now on India. So I think all in all, it's tough, it's challenging over there, but we feel good where we stand from a supply point of view."

I think as a general comment on COVID, it's obviously still ongoing. We're still very much in the midst of it. What we do see is, from a demand perspective, kind of a divergence in the countries where some countries are clearly improving. In China, for example, has been actually headwinds because we compare this quarter to a very low first quarter last year because COVID started there first. We see other regions slowly recovering mostly due to vaccinations. And then we see countries getting worse, like India or Latin America. 
So I think what we can say overall at this point, we're reaffirming our guidance. We assume a gradual recovery in the second quarter. And we're very confident that the diversity and the robustness that we have, both on the commercial side as well as the supply side shows the strength of our model."

Look, I think it's very clear that we are very, very pleased with our quarter 1 results. We come from a position of strength. There's no other way to say it. I think the results show, and we did validate with it multiple times, the diversified and robust business model that we have that can absorb individual headwinds in one part of the business while really jumping and seizing opportunities where and when we see them. And I think you saw us do that in quarter 1. 
You also see the strength of quarter 1 being in all 4 of our commercial segments, in all 3 of our categories, whether it's brand, generics or complex generics and biosimilars. And we've been, I think, very transparent what part of that is due to timing, what part of that is due to FX and what part of it is really underlying business performance. But it's also just 1 quarter. So what we're saying is, at this point, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. We're very confident in that. That applies to revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. We're confident we're delivering on our commitments. 
And as we would a regular course of business do, we'll look at it again after the second quarter and then update the guidance at that point. So that's what that comment is. On the question you have on [ Organon ], look, I think it's very clear that we're very pleased with this because it's a real positive for investors to have another company to add as a comparable to our newly created peer set. But we are obviously focused on running Viatris, we're 100% focused on that. And we're excited about the differentiated platform that we have. And let me give you some of that differentiation. One, we have a truly global operating platform, one that has significant scale, significant commercial capabilities, expertise across science and manufacturing with even IP. 
Very importantly, we've got a broad and diverse product portfolio that includes brands, complex and biosimilars and generics. And that's important, is agnostic to any particular therapeutic area. So in particular, dosage form and in particular, delivery mechanism. And that gives us robustness and opportunities going forward. And we're very proud of the strong R&D that we have, that really positions us well to deliver a broad pipeline of complex and novel products, including the late-stage biosimilars. You saw some of the progress we made on the pipeline just this quarter. So that's what I would comment there. We're focused on Viatris, and I think the robustness and diversity of the platform is unique that we have."

For the U.S. and Europe, this market -- these products are commoditized. They are steady teddy, whatever is left is steady teddy that these are for reasons they're called iconic brands. So there's still brand share they command in some of these markets. So we have seen over the last 3, 4, 5 years, there's a pretty steady business, not much erosion there. 
Emerging markets are still they're the iconic brands, and there's a getting for these brands. People are looking for these iconic names. And these are the branded generic market per se, the health care environment as the consumerism is growing, as spend on the health care cost is growing, we see the opportunity over there. Many of these markets, there is a mixed bag, but the growing emerging markets, we sometimes call them between us. This is where we see some opportunity over there. You've seen at JANZ, once you lose it -- you have an LOE, there's a combination of retaining some of the brand business and the AG business. That kicks in for us. 
We have a pretty effective weapon in terms of authorized JANZ which includes data market share in markets like Japan, especially Japan. And you are already seeing the value of iconic brand and how much equity they can hold in a retail channel like China. So per se, we are not very much -- overall, if I have to say, we are not very much concerned about the competition coming in from generics to this brand. I think we have factored in the way we are managing this business is at a very granular level, not one global approach, but a country-by-country approach."

On revenue, we've got a good understanding of the base erosion that we have in the business. We have a good understanding of the new pipeline revenue we can bring. But if you look at it quarter-on-quarter or even year-on-year, it can be a bit choppy because of things like COVID, for example, or because of URP China timing. If that gets further delayed, that would change a little bit how '21 over '22 develops.

And then secondly, on EBITDA growth. If I use your starting debt this year, the midpoint of your guide and your debt paydown guidance and your leverage goal and I put those things together, it kind of implies to me that you're looking at a 2023 EBITDA figure somewhere between like 6.8% and 6.9%. Given you're going to get another $500 million in synergies over '22 and '23, that would imply organic EBITDA growth somewhere in the like $100 million to $200 million range.

The requirements in the guidance talks about characterizing the quarter structure and the post consolation modification across multiple batches, which seems to be very hard in the case of botulinum toxin.

And we're going to always apply a disciplined investment criteria and very, very strictly diligence on that. So you can absolutely expect us to be very active in the space, but consistent with our capital allocation priorities. In terms of focus areas, I want to maybe highlight 4. One is established brands within our therapeutic categories or established channels that we have that are synergistic to that. You've seen what we can do with the Thrombosis franchise, for example, where we take it and improve on it. Biosimilars, clearly a focus area for us. China is a focus area for us. And then anything that helps us go up the value chain with more differentiation and longer tails. We not -- we're looking for long-term sustainable kind of revenue in these areas. So that's -- I would say, these are the areas that I want to focus on. And then on the $1.5 billion, Sanjeev, if you could take that question."

Clearly, the other thing important to note is quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be variability. As I said, quarter 2, the onetime cost is going to be higher because of a lot of the tax and legal settlements that are happening in quarter 2. But overall, for the full year, we expect that to be around $1.5 billion. Going forward, again, not giving the guidance, and I think the simple way to think about this is, by the end of third year, I expect the $1.5 billion to be down significantly to the level that legacy Mylan used to be, which was I think in 2017, 2018 used to be about $500 million. So as you can see, the trajectory is going to come down significantly next year. And obviously, when we provide the 2022 guidance, we'll let you know about the exact amount."

I'm pleased to say that the strong execution we showed in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. We are performing a",1015,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarterly earnings call as Viatris. I'm pleased to say that the strong execution we showed in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. We are performing at or above the upper end of our own expectations across the entire business. All 4 of our commercial segments, all 3 of our product categories, our manufacturing operations, our R&D and our enabling functions and thereby laying a solid foundation for future performance. 
Today's strong results are not only a testament to the flawless execution of our colleagues who have quickly come together as 1 Viatris team but also validate the vision and the strategy we had in combining the 2 legacy organizations. The combination brought together 2 highly complementary, high-quality, investment-grade companies creating an even stronger, more powerful, unique and differentiated global platform, focused on empowering people worldwide to live healthy at every stage of life by ensuring patient access to safe, effective and high-quality medicines. 
Mylan brought Viatris portfolio diversity, a rich R&D pipeline, strong internal scientific capabilities and proven integration expertise. And Upjohn provided strong iconic brands, a global commercial engine and scale in critical markets. The result is an even stronger future-ready and resilient platform with enhanced global scale and geographic reach, a sustainable, diverse and differentiated portfolio and pipeline, a powerful operating platform and strong commercial capabilities with significant future potential and the power to generate strong and sustainable cash flows. And today marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have demonstrated our ability to drive the value of this combination and we remain confident in our outlook. 
Now let me dive into the quarter. In the second quarter, we reported total revenue of USD 4.58 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.68 billion and free cash flow of $470 million. For the first half of the year, meaning quarter 1 and quarter 2 combined, we have generated $1.27 billion in free cash flow, more than half of our initial guidance for the full year. 
Free cash flow generation continues to be our North Star. Our unique global platform has the ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flows, and we anticipate significant increases in the coming years, driven by continued strong performance, a reduction in onetime costs and continued improvements in cash flow conversion. And given how critical cash flow is to our long-term financials, our strategy and commitment to shareholders, the Board has also made it one of the key metrics of management's short- and long-term compensation. 
But performance extends not only to our commercial segments but also to our operations. Even in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing supply network optimization efforts, we have seen customer service levels that are at or above historic peaks. And I continue to be impressed with our internal R&D engine and scientific capabilities. In July, we received a historic approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the industry's first-ever interchangeable biosimilar product in the U.S., Semglee or insulin glargine. We're extremely proud of this achievement, which will help broaden access to this important diabetes medicine for patients, for physicians, for payers and for providers. 
And as you know from what's said by FDA and policymakers throughout the government, there is significant interest in this approval and what it can mean for patients and the health care system overall, both now and in the future. The interchangeable assembly product, which will allow for substitution for the reference product at the pharmacy counter, will be introduced before the end of the year. 
Assembly is not the only advancement in our pipeline this quarter. With regard to our biosimilar and complex product pipeline, we're making steady progress across multiple programs, which Rajiv will discuss in more detail. Overall, we generated $224 million in new product revenue, and we continue to be on track for $690 million in new product revenue for the full year. 
This high level of performance enables us to continue to deliver on our commitments. We've paid down $1.15 billion in debt year-to-date, and we're well on track to achieve $6.5 billion in debt repayment by 2023. In June, we returned value to shareholders by paying our first quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, and the Viatris Board has declared another $0.11 per share dividend for the next quarter. And we're on track to achieve $500 million in synergies this year and on track for at least $1 billion by the end of 2023. 
On last quarter's earnings call, I said that we would reassess guidance for the full year. Based on our strong first and second quarter performance, I'm pleased to report that we are raising our guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which Sanjeev will discuss in more detail. We have strong momentum going to the second half of the year, and we will be once again open to reassessing financial guidance at the end of the third quarter. 
Also on last earnings call, I stated that we see $6.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA as a true floor of our business going forward. And with the momentum we have, this is now clearer than ever. We also continue to make good progress in our rigorous bottom-up strategic planning effort. By better understanding how our portfolio will evolve over the next several years and looking at all the strategic levers at our disposal, we will be better able to serve patients, provide increased access to medicine and unlock value for our shareholders. And that work will complete towards the end of the year. 
Lastly, and as I've already mentioned, I cannot emphasize enough the impressive R&D engine and scientific [indiscernible] As we prepare to deliver our strategic plan, you can fully expect that we will continue to add high-value assets to our pipeline and further leverage our scientific expertise and R&D platform. With that said, now let me turn it over to Rajiv for more details about our segment results, pipeline progress and restructuring and integration efforts. Rajiv?"

We had another strong quarter and are very pleased with the positive momentum across our entire business, driven by strong commercial performance supported by excellent customer service levels, continued scientific execution of our diversified pipeline, including a historic first approval of an interchangeable biosimilar to insulin glargine. This was achieved while we continue to successfully integrate fee structure and navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our performance would not be possible without the dedication of our global workforce, and I would like to thank them for their continued commitment. 
Over the next several slides, I will walk you through the performance in each of our segments and product categories. I will be making certain comparisons to the combined LOE adjusted second quarter 2020 results on a constant currency basis as well as comparisons versus our expectations as included in our initial guidance. 
Beginning on Slide 6. Each of our segments and product categories delivered a strong performance. When excluding the impact of Japan's Lyrica and Celebrex LOEs, as seen on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, net sales were up 4% this quarter as compared to the combined LOE adjusted quarter 2 2020 results. Our brand business grew by 3% year-over-year and performed better than our expectations. We are pleased to report that our global biosimilar portfolio grew by 40% this quarter, while our overall complex generics and biosimilars category declined by 8% year-over-year, mainly due to anticipated competition on certain products in our complex generics portfolio. 
Our global generics business grew by 8% year-over-year and performed better than our expectations. We delivered $224 million for new launches in the second quarter. And as we look ahead, we remain on track to meet our $690 million target in 2021. We believe that the diversity of our portfolio and commercial reach positions us well to balance the impact of any changes in the market and eliminate our reliance on any 1 product or geography. Accordingly, we expect our base business to continue to perform strongly. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our developed market segment grew by 2% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by brands like Yupelri, Dymista and Creon. Our thrombosis portfolio also performed better than expected, which continues to highlight our ability to effectively manage and grow established brands and expand our presence in the hospital segment. Our biosimilars performed strongly with 47% growth this quarter, which helped offset the negative impact of the previously anticipated competition to Wixela and XULANE. 
Our generics portfolio also performed better than our expectations, primarily driven by our U.S. injectables portfolio as well as favorable COVID-related buying patterns in Europe. Having said that, we see our biosimilars portfolio driving continued growth while offsetting anticipated competition in our complex generics space. 
Moving to the next slide. Our emerging markets segment delivered 12% year-over-year growth and performed better than our expectations. Brands like Viagra and Lyrica drove strong performance as certain countries started recovering from COVID. Our better-than-expected results of our generics business was helped by certain COVID-related products. The next slide shows that our JANZ segment grew 6% year-over-year and performed in line with our expectations. 
Our brand portfolio of products like Lyrica and EpiPen primarily contributed to the strong performance of Japan. We continue to be pleased with the growth of our generics business in JANZ, especially the contribution from our expanded authorized generics offering, including authorized generics to Lyrica and Celebrex. It should be noted that approximately half of the overall generics growth is due to the termination of our collaboration with Pfizer from the prior year. 
The next slide is our last segment slide and shows that our greater China business once again delivered a strong performance, which was better than our expectations. Our retail channel showed double-digit growth and our hospital channel performed better than our expectations while managing the impact of VBP and URP. The 3% year-over-year decline was driven by anticipated VBP implementation of Celebrex and Zoloft. As we look at the rest of the year, we anticipate the full year to be better than our original expectations, although we see the second half being softer than the first because of the implementation of URP. 
Now turning to Slide 12, which highlights our proven track record of introducing several first-to-market complex products. Breaking down barriers goes beyond best-in-class science. And right from day 1, our cross-functional team of R&D, regulatory, legal, medical, and policy experts worked diligently and collaboratively with regulators, partners and other stakeholders to seek and create pathways to clear hurdles that enable access. It can take on average 7 to 9 years from development to regulatory approval, given the highly complex nature of these molecules. 
Getting to the finish line requires tremendous perseverance, tenacity and an unwavering commitment to patients. The success stories of receiving the first approval for our Copaxone 40-milligram Advair, Neulasta, Herceptin, Symbicort and most recently, the first interchangeable biosimilars to the test give us great confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our pipeline. We intend to leverage our deep scientific capabilities to further expand access to the complex products for patients. 
I will now walk you through some key pipeline updates starting on Slide 13. As it relates to our biosimilars' key pipeline, I would like to take a moment to echo Michael's remarks and applaud the efforts of so many Viatris colleagues who played a huge role in achieving this historic FDA approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar, Semglee. We look forward to launch this exciting opportunity before the end of the year. 
Moving to Park, a pre-approval inspection from FDA of Biocon's manufacturing facility in Malaysia is now scheduled for the end of this quarter. Scientifically, we believe we are on track to achieve interchangeability for [indiscernible] which should further expand our portfolio of interchangeable insulin. We remain on schedule for a submission in quarter 4 of this year for [indiscernible] Our program for BOTOX is progressing well, and we have a meeting scheduled with the FDA in September of this year to align on our path forward. 
Moving to biosimilar to Avastin. While we have no open scientific questions with FDA, our U.S. approval has been impacted by the delay in a pre-approval inspection due to COVID travel restrictions. The same product has been approved by TGA, MHRA and several other regulators. 
As you will see on the next slide, we continue to make steady progress on our complex product programs and have some important upcoming milestones. We submitted our 505(b)(2) application to FDA for our levothyroxine oral solution in June as planned. For our meloxicam, we expect an IND submission with Phase IIb study planned for quarter 4 this year. We are excited with the progress of our new low-dose formulation of XULANE, and we plan to initiate our clinical dosing for our Phase III program in September. 
We also continue to make comprehensive progress on our complex injectable pipeline. We are happy to report that we are first to file on paliperidone once 3-month product [indiscernible] INVEGA TRINZA on the 546-milligram and 829-milligram strengths. The remaining strengths of 410 and 273 milligrams have already been submitted and are pending acceptance from FDA. 
Before I conclude, I would like to touch upon our integration and restructuring activities. Since closing the transaction almost 9 months ago, our teams have been hard at work to ensure no business disruption. We remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies this year and confident in our overall plans to achieve at least $1 billion of cost synergies by 2023. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."

As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another strong quarter with better-than-expected revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. These results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business and the mom",1163,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another strong quarter with better-than-expected revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. These results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business and the momentum we have going into rest of the year. In slides ahead, I will make comparison to prior year Mylan stand-alone, combined adjusted for Viatris and the factors that are leading to an increase in our 2021 guidance. 
On Slide 17, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's stand-alone results for quarter 2 2020. Moving to Slide 18. We've highlighted the drivers in the quarter compared to combined adjusted Q2 2020 results. This chart reflects the sum of Mylan's stand-alone results and Upjohn's carve-out financials for a period of April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, adjusted for certain LOEs and transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with the combination. 
A few key comments on this slide, beginning with Lyrica and Celebrex LOE. While we continue to see anticipated decline versus last year, our commercial teams have done a nice job in managing rate of erosion as the generic penetration levels have come in better than our expectations. Adjusting for LOEs, operationally, total net sales in the quarter were up 4%. This growth was driven by strong demand across Yupelri, Dymista, the thrombosis portfolio, Viagra and the new product revenue. 
Base business erosion was driven by price declines in our generic business and was in line with our expectation and also anticipated competition across 3 of our complex products. For example, competition in Wixela, XULANE and Perforomist contributed to base erosion in the quarter. This erosion was partially offset by 40% growth of our global biosimilar portfolio. For the year, we continue to expect base business erosion to be approximately 3% to 4%. 
As compared to Q2 2020, COVID had a positive impact in the quarter primarily due to full recovery in China and partial recovery in emerging market in Europe. Given the evolving COVID situation, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect a slower recovery than originally anticipated across key markets. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, the weaker dollar relative to key currencies such as euro and Chinese renminbi provided an approximately 4% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 results. 
Moving to Slide 19, which bridges adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter, we had a higher run rate of inventory write-off, which had a negative impact on our gross margin. We don't expect this level of write-offs to continue in the subsequent quarters. As mentioned previously and as expected, base business erosion was predominantly driven by competitive pressure on high-margin complex products and, to a lesser extent, anticipated price decline across rest of the portfolio in North America and Europe. As you look at gross margin, it is down slightly on a sequential basis. This is primarily driven by anticipated product mix and the higher inventory write-offs. Integration and restructuring activities remain on track and SG&A was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 20. For quarter 2 2021, free cash flow generation was strong and better than expected at $470 million. As I highlighted during quarter 1, free cash flow declined versus quarter 1 due to increased onetime cash costs, interest payment in Q2 and increased operational working capital and CapEx. I'm encouraged by higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA to cash flow conversion and year-to-date cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. This is net of approximately $800 million in onetime cost. The results reflect the organization focus and company's commitment to cash flow, and we are seeing an early benefit from cash flow improvement initiatives. 
Turning to balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects a repayment of June $2.2 billion maturity, partially offset by lower-than-anticipated increase in our [ term ] short-term balance. In the quarter, cash was used for the European thrombosis transaction and dividend payment to the shareholders. We also extended our $4 billion revolving credit facility to a 5-year term and, for the first time, incorporated the option to include sustainability metrics consistent with our future corporate ESG goals. 
Moving to Slide 22. Based on underlying strength of our business, we're raising our full year 2021 guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The expected increase in revenue was driven by stronger performance in the underlying business. This includes the lower than previously anticipated full year impact of URP in the greater China region, year-to-date tailwind from foreign exchange rate, lower generic penetration for Lyrica in Japan and sustained strength from brand. Partially offsetting these positive trends include anticipated competition in North America, lower generic volume in emerging markets and slower COVID recovery. 
As a result of increased top line expectation and margin pull-through on these items, we are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance. This includes SG&A investment that is now expected to bring us to the high end of the range of [ 20.5 to 21.5 ] as a percentage of total revenue. Free cash flow guidance has also been increased as a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash taxes and continued cash flow improvement initiatives. 
With respect to key metrics underlying our financial guidance, which are largely unchanged, we have lowered our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18% due to the favorable mix of income across our tax jurisdiction. 
Now with few comments on second half phasing. We now expect second half revenue to be slightly lower than first half. This is primarily driven by anticipated competition in select brands and complex generics and expected lower sales of COVID-related products. With respect to Greater China, we anticipate slightly lower revenue as a result of VBP and URP timing. 
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. While the strength in the base business continues, we'll also expect competition to negatively impact gross margin slightly in the second half of the year. In addition, we are assuming R&D and SG&A investment to sequentially pick up, which we expect will help fuel long-term sustainability and growth for the business. We're also expecting the second half free cash flow phasing will be impacted by timing of capital expenditure. The underlying strength and momentum we see in business and solid execution gives us confidence in the outlook for the back half of 2021 and I believe positions us for a solid starting point heading into 2022. 
As we mentioned previously, we expect onetime cash for the next 2 years to a historical Mylan level of approximately $500 million. With the momentum we have built and what we can see to date, highly confident that we will meet our stated objectives of potential dividend growth, $6.5 billion of debt paydown by 2023 and increased financial flexibility for the company going forward. With the execution I've seen and our ability to [indiscernible] that, let me open the call for Q&A."

We're very, very pleased with the performance, strength of the business, all segments, all product grouping and the momentum we have getting into the second half. So there are a couple of things that are going on, and I'll walk you through both on the revenue and EBITDA lines. 
So revenue line, starting with that. So we talked about China, again performing better than our expectation but we'll expect a step down in the second half because of the timing of COVID and VBP. The second part we have is the anticipated competition in products like Wixela, XULANE, Perforomist, all reflected in the -- in our guidance, but that will have an impact in the second half versus first half, and that will have an impact on our gross margin as well. 
And then you have, to a lesser extent, you have some of the COVID-related buying that happened in quarter 2, that's going to step down in quarter 3, quarter 4. Put all those things together, you will see roughly second half revenue to be lower than the first half, though the underlying strength of the business continues. Now taking the EBITDA, exactly some of these elements that I mentioned, will have a flow-through impact on the gross margin, even though I expect the gross margin for full year to be in the range of 58% to 59%. 
The other important item that's having an effect on the EBITDA is the pickup sequentially on SG&A and R&D expenses. And that's all, again, reflected in the guidance. We're expecting the SG&A and R&D to pick up, part of it is COVID but part of it is deliberate design of investing into the business, so that we have not only achieved our objective for this year but have a stronger momentum getting into next year. 
All those are reflecting in the EBITDA for second half to be slightly lower, but again, strong. And on the cash flow, again, the performance, strength and everything continues that I mentioned about it, the working capital improvement initiatives, better cash flow from operations and the higher -- the only offsetting on the cash flow side is the higher CapEx that we expect in the second half versus the first half, which is on the timing of that. So that kind of gives you the sense of the rhythm of all 3 items."

And 1 other question was about how difficult is interchangeability. And I would say, look, Gary, ideally suited products for interchangeability of a chronically administered biosimilars, where disease needs to be relatively stable and with a limited chance of rapid decline and it's a case by case. And it does include the current guidance across for the biosimilars on interchangeability includes pharmacokinetic equivalence after 3 switches of test reference, test versus the reference so there is additional work in science and 
Now coming back to the launch, very excited and very proud of this achievement. It's a new level with the new NDC and FDA has agreed with our set framework to transition in the interchangeable product while transitioning out the non-interchangeable. And we have agreed also in the time frame of a period of about 6 months to manage this, which aligns well with ramping up our supply of interchangeable markets. 
From a commercial point of view, if anybody knows this market, this market is not just commercial driven by the just formularies or PBMs. It's made up of Medicare Part D, that's the second 1 controlled by the PBMs. The third one, Medicaid, the government, VA hospital, corrections, Cashway and FS. And every market channel segment has its own dynamics and nuances. So there is no 1 silver bullet or 1 strategy to commercialize. 
Our goal will be to basically drive the excess, and we believe that the substitution at the pharmacy level will help us drive that. And we see, from a timing perspective, we see some -- you will see some uptick in the market share around [indiscernible] but the actual and the decent impact of interchangeability to the market share perspective and excess will be seen over the next year. 
For us, I see this as a long-term opportunity with a long tail. And just 1 thing I missed, I think, on your question around how long, we do have 12-month exclusivity for any other interchangeable product to come. So I think I've answered most of your questions."

I'm pleased to say that the strong execution we showed in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. We are performing a",1018,"Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarterly earnings call as Viatris. I'm pleased to say that the strong execution we showed in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. We are performing at or above the upper end of our own expectations across the entire business. All 4 of our commercial segments, all 3 of our product categories, our manufacturing operations, our R&D and our enabling function and thereby laying a solid foundation for future performance.
Today's strong results are not only a testament to the flawless execution of our colleagues who have quickly come together as one Viatris team but also validate the vision and the strategy we have in combining the 2 legacy organizations. The combination brought together 2 highly complementary, high-quality, investment-grade companies creating an even stronger, more powerful, unique and differentiated global platform, focused on empowering people worldwide to live healthy at every stage of life by ensuring patient access to safe, effective and high-quality medicines.
Mylan brought Viatris portfolio diversity, a rich R&D pipeline, strong internal scientific capabilities and proven integration expertise. And Upjohn provided strong iconic brands, a global commercial engine and scale in critical markets. The result is an even stronger future-ready and resilient platform with enhanced global scale and geographic reach, a sustainable, diverse and differentiated portfolio and pipeline, a powerful operating platform and strong commercial capabilities with significant future potential and the power to generate strong and sustainable cash flows. And today marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have demonstrated our ability to drive the value of this combination, and we remain confident in our outlook. 
Now let me dive into the quarter. In the second quarter, we reported total revenue of USD 4.58 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.68 billion and free cash flow of $470 million. For the first half of the year, meaning quarter 1 and quarter 2 combined, we have generated $1.27 billion in free cash flow, more than half of our initial guidance for the full year.
Free cash flow generation continues to be our north star. Our unique global platform has the ability to consistently generate substantial free cash flows, and we anticipate significant increases in the coming years, driven by continued strong performance, a reduction in onetime cost and continued improvements in cash flow conversion. And given how critical cash flow is to our long-term financials, our strategy and commitment to shareholders, the Board has also made it one of the key metrics of management's short- and long-term compensation.
But performance extends not only to our commercial segments but also to our operations. Even in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic and our ongoing supply network optimization efforts, we have seen customer service levels that are at or above historic peaks. And I continue to be impressed with our internal R&D engine and scientific capabilities. In July, we received a historic approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the industry's first-ever interchangeable biosimilar product in the U.S., Semglee or insulin glargine. We're extremely proud of this achievement, which will help broaden access to this important diabetes medicine for patients, for physicians, for payers and for providers.
And as you know from what's said by FDA and policymakers throughout the government, there is significant interest in this approval and what it can mean for patients and the health care system overall, both now and in the future. The interchangeable assembly product, which will allow for substitution for the reference product at the pharmacy counter, will be introduced before the end of the year.
Assembly is not the only advancement in our pipeline this quarter. With regard to our biosimilar and complex products pipeline, we're making steady progress across multiple programs, which Rajiv will discuss in more detail. Overall, we generated $224 million in new product revenue, and we continue to be on track for $690 million in new product revenue for the full year.
This high level of performance enables us to continue to deliver on our commitments. We've paid down $1.15 billion in debt year-to-date, and we're well on track to achieve $6.5 billion in debt repayment by 2023. In June, we returned value to shareholders by paying our first quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, and the Viatris Board has declared another $0.11 per share dividend for the next quarter. And we're on track to achieve $500 million in synergies this year and on track for at least $1 billion by the end of 2023. 
On last quarter's earnings call, I said that we would reassess guidance for the full year. Based on our strong first and second quarter performance, I'm pleased to report that we are raising our guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which Sanjeev will discuss in more detail. We have strong momentum going to the second half of the year, and we will be once again open to reassessing financial guidance at the end of the third quarter.
Also on last earnings call, I stated that we see $6.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA as a true floor of our business going forward. And with the momentum we have, this is now clearer than ever. We also continue to make good progress in our rigorous bottom-up strategic planning effort. By better understanding how our portfolio will evolve over the next several years and looking at all the strategic levers at our disposal, we will be better able to serve patients, provide increased access to medicine and unlock value for our shareholders. And that work will complete towards the end of the year. 
Lastly, and as I've already mentioned, I cannot emphasize enough the impressive R&D engine and scientific capabilities that we have. As we prepare to deliver our strategic plan, you can fully expect that we will continue to add high-value assets to our pipeline and further leverage our scientific expertise and R&D platform. With that said, now let me turn it over to Rajiv for more details about our segment results, pipeline progress and restructuring and integration efforts. Rajiv?"

We had another strong quarter and are very pleased with the positive momentum across our entire business, driven by strong commercial performance, supported by excellent customer service levels, continued scientific execution of our diversified pipeline, including a historic first approval of an interchangeable biosimilar to insulin glargine. This was achieved while we continue to successfully integrate fee structure and navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our performance would not be possible without the dedication of our global workforce, and I would like to thank them for their continued commitment.
Over the next several slides, I will walk you through the performance in each of our segments and product categories. I will be making certain comparisons to the combined LOE adjusted second quarter 2020 results on a constant currency basis as well as comparisons versus our expectations as included in our initial guidance. 
Beginning on Slide 6. Each of our segments and product categories delivered a strong performance. When excluding the impact of Japan's Lyrica and Celebrex LOEs, as seen on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, net sales were up 4% this quarter as compared to the combined LOE adjusted quarter 2 2020 results. Our brand business grew by 3% year-over-year and performed better than our expectations. We are pleased to report that our global biosimilar portfolio grew by 40% this quarter, while our overall complex generics and biosimilars category declined by 8% year-over-year, mainly due to anticipated competition on certain products in our complex generics portfolio.
Our global generics business grew by 8% year-over-year and performed better than our expectations. We delivered $224 million for new launches in the second quarter. And as we look ahead, we remain on track to meet our $690 million target in 2021. We believe that the diversity of our portfolio and commercial reach positions us well to balance the impact of any changes in the market and eliminate our reliance on any one product or geography. Accordingly, we expect our base business to continue to perform strongly. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our Developed Markets segment grew by 2% year-over-year. This was primarily driven by brands like Yupelri, Dymista and Creon. Our thrombosis portfolio also performed better than expected, which continues to highlight our ability to effectively manage and grow established brands and expand our presence in the hospital segment. Our biosimilars performed strongly with 47% growth this quarter, which helped offset the negative impact of the previously anticipated competition to Wixela and XULANE. Our generics portfolio also performed better than our expectations, primarily driven by our U.S. injectables portfolio, as well as favorable COVID-related buying patterns in Europe. Having said that, we see our biosimilars portfolio driving continued growth while offsetting anticipated competition in our complex generics space.
Moving to the next slide. Our Emerging Markets segment delivered 12% year-over-year growth and performed better than our expectations. Brands like Viagra and Lyrica drove strong performance as certain countries started recovering from COVID. Our better-than-expected results of our generics business was helped by certain COVID-related products. 
The next slide shows that our JANZ segment grew 6% year-over-year and performed in line with our expectations. Our brand portfolio of products like Lyrica and EpiPen primarily contributed to the strong performance of Japan. We continue to be pleased with the growth of our generics business in JANZ, especially the contribution from our expanded authorized generics offering, including authorized generics to Lyrica and Celebrex. It should be noted that approximately half of the overall generics growth is due to the termination of our collaboration with Pfizer from the prior year.
The next slide is our last segment slide and shows that our Greater China business once again delivered a strong performance, which was better than our expectations. Our retail channel showed double-digit growth, and our hospital channel performed better than our expectations while managing the impact of VBP and URP. The 3% year-over-year decline was driven by anticipated VBP implementation of Celebrex and Zoloft. As we look at the rest of the year, we anticipate the full year to be better than our original expectations, although we see the second half being softer than the first because of the implementation of URP.
Now turning to Slide 12, which highlights our proven track record of introducing several first-to-market complex products. Breaking down barriers goes beyond best-in-class science. And right from day 1, our cross-functional team of R&D, regulatory, legal, medical, and policy experts worked diligently and collaboratively with regulators, partners and other stakeholders to seek and create pathways to clear hurdles that enable access. It can take, on average, 7 to 9 years from development to regulatory approval, given the highly complex nature of these molecules. Getting to the finish line requires tremendous perseverance, tenacity and an unwavering commitment to patients. The success stories of receiving the first approval for our Copaxone 40-milligram, Advair, Neulasta, Herceptin, Symbicort, and most recently, the first interchangeable biosimilar to the Lantus, give us great confidence that we are well positioned to deliver on our pipeline. We intend to leverage our deep scientific capabilities to further expand access to the complex products for patients.
I will now walk you through some key pipeline updates starting on Slide 13. As it relates to our biosimilars' key pipeline, I would like to take a moment to echo Michael's remarks and applaud the efforts of so many Viatris colleagues who played a huge role in achieving this historic FDA approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar, Semglee. We look forward to launch this exciting opportunity before the end of the year.
Moving to [ F Park ], a pre-approval inspection from FDA of Biocon's manufacturing facility in Malaysia is now scheduled for the end of this quarter. Scientifically, we believe we are on track to achieve interchangeability for [F Park ] which should further expand our portfolio of interchangeable insulin. 
We remain on schedule for a submission in quarter 4 of this year for EYLEA. Our program for BOTOX is progressing well, and we have a meeting scheduled with the FDA in September of this year to align on our path forward.
Moving to biosimilar to Avastin. While we have no open scientific questions with the FDA, our U.S. approval has been impacted by the delay in a pre-approval inspection due to COVID travel restrictions. The same product has been approved by TGA, MHRA and several other regulators.
As you will see on the next slide, we continue to make steady progress on our complex product programs and have some important upcoming milestones. We submitted our 505(b)(2) application to FDA for our levothyroxine oral solution in June, as planned. For our meloxicam, we expect an IND submission with Phase IIb study planned for quarter 4 this year. We are excited with the progress of our new low-dose formulation of XULANE, and we plan to initiate our clinical dosing for our Phase III program in September.
We also continue to make comprehensive progress on our complex injectable pipeline. We are happy to report that we are first to file on paliperidone once/3 months product if led to Invega TRINZA on the 546-milligram and 829-milligram strengths. The remaining strengths of 410 and 273 milligrams have already been submitted and are pending acceptance from FDA. 
Before I conclude, I would like to touch upon our integration and restructuring activities. Since closing the transaction almost 9 months ago, our teams have been hard at work to ensure no business disruption. We remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies this year and confident in our overall plans to achieve at least $1 billion of cost synergies by 2023. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."
290203,1673391999,2370114,"Viatris Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2021",2021-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another strong quarter with better-than-expected revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation.

As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another strong quarter with better-than-expected revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. These results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business and the momentum we have going into rest of the year. In slides ahead, I will make comparison to prior year Mylan standalone, combined adjusted for Viatris and the factors that are leading to an increase in our 2021 guidance. 
On Slide 17, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's standalone results for quarter 2 2020. 
Moving to Slide 18. We've highlighted the drivers in the quarter compared to combined adjusted Q2 2020 results. This chart reflects the sum of Mylan's standalone results and Upjohn's carve-out financials for a period of April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, adjusted for certain LOEs and transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with the combination.
A few key comments on this slide, beginning with Lyrica and Celebrex LOE. While we continue to see anticipated decline versus last year, our commercial teams have done a nice job in managing rate of erosion as the generic penetration levels have come in better than our expectations. Adjusting for LOEs, operationally, total net sales in the quarter were up 4%. This growth was driven by strong demand across Yupelri, Dymista, the thrombosis portfolio, Viagra and the new product revenue. 
Base business erosion was driven by price declines in our generic business and was in line with our expectation and also anticipated competition across 3 of our complex products. For example, competition in Wixela, XULANE and PERFOROMIST contributed to base erosion in the quarter. This erosion was partially offset by 40% growth of our global biosimilar portfolio. For the year, we continue to expect base business erosion to be approximately 3% to 4%. 
As compared to Q2 2020, COVID had a positive impact in the quarter, primarily due to full recovery in China and partial recovery in emerging market in Europe. Given the evolving COVID situation, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect a slower recovery than originally anticipated across key markets. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, the weaker dollar relative to key currencies, such as euro and Chinese renminbi, provided an approximately 4% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 results. 
Moving to Slide 19 which bridges adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter, we had a higher run rate of inventory write-off, which had a negative impact on our gross margin. We don't expect this level of write-offs to continue in the subsequent quarters. As mentioned previously and as expected, base business erosion was predominantly driven by competitive pressure on high-margin complex products, and to a lesser extent, anticipated price decline across rest of the portfolio in North America and Europe. As you look at gross margin, it is down slightly on a sequential basis. This is primarily driven by anticipated product mix and the higher inventory write-offs. Integration and restructuring activities remain on track and SG&A was in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Slide 20. For quarter 2 2021, free cash flow generation was strong and better than expected at $470 million. As I highlighted during quarter 1, free cash flow declined versus quarter 1 due to increased onetime cash cost, interest payment in Q2 and increased operational working capital and CapEx. I'm encouraged by higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA to cash flow conversion and year-to-date cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion. This is net of approximately $800 million in onetime cost. The results reflect the organization focus and company's commitment to cash flow, and we are seeing an early benefit from cash flow improvement initiatives.
Turning to balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have reduced our debt by approximately $1.2 billion, which reflects a repayment of June $2.2 billion maturity, partially offset by lower-than-anticipated increase in our [ Q term ] short-term balance. In the quarter, cash was used for the European thrombosis transaction and dividend payment to the shareholders. We also extended our $4 billion revolving credit facility to a 5-year term, and for the first time, incorporated the option to include sustainability metrics consistent with our future corporate ESG goals. 
Moving to Slide 22. Based on underlying strength of our business, we're raising our full year 2021 guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The expected increase in revenue was driven by stronger performance in the underlying business. This includes the lower than previously anticipated full year impact of URP in the Greater China region, year-to-date tailwind from foreign exchange rate, lower generic penetration for Lyrica in Japan and sustained strength from brand. Partially offsetting these positive trends include anticipated competition in North America, lower generic volume in emerging markets and slower COVID recovery. 
As a result of increased top line expectation and margin pull-through on these items, we are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance. This includes SG&A investment that is now expected to bring us to the high end of the range of 20.5% to 21.5% as a percentage of total revenue. Free cash flow guidance has also been increased as a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash taxes and continued cash flow improvement initiatives. With respect to key metrics underlying our financial guidance, which are largely unchanged, we have lowered our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18% due to the favorable mix of income across our tax jurisdiction. 
Now with few comments on second half phasing. We now expect second half revenue to be slightly lower than first half. This is primarily driven by anticipated competition in select brands and complex generics and expected lower sales of COVID-related products. With respect to Greater China, we anticipate slightly lower revenue as a result of VBP and URP timing. 
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. While the strength in the base business continues, we'll also expect competition to negatively impact gross margin slightly in the second half of the year. In addition, we are assuming R&D and SG&A investment to sequentially pick up, which we expect will help fuel long-term sustainability and growth of the business. We're also expecting the second half free cash flow phasing will be impacted by timing of capital expenditure. The underlying strength and momentum we see in business and solid execution gives us confidence in the outlook for the back half of 2021 and I believe positions us for a solid starting point heading into 2022. 
As we mentioned previously, we expect onetime cash cost to decrease significantly over the next 2 years to historical Mylan level of approximately $500 million. With the momentum we have built and what we can see to date, our 3-year cash outlook makes us highly confident that we will meet our stated objectives of potential dividend growth, $6.5 billion of debt paydown by 2023 and increased financial flexibility for the company going forward. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the execution I've seen and our ability to deliver on our commitments. 
With that, let me open the call for Q&A."

The third aspect is the modest benefit because of the lower cash tax that we see for the remainder in the year. 
So overall, those 3 items are contributing to our increase in free cash flow, not only for rest of the year, but I see that momentum exiting into next year.

We're very, very pleased with the performance, strength of the business, all segments, all product grouping and the momentum we have getting into the second half. So there are a couple of things that are going on, and I'll walk you through, both on the revenue and EBITDA lines. 
So revenue line, starting with that. So we talked about China, again performing better than our expectation, but we'll expect a step-down in the second half because of the timing of COVID and VBP. The second part we have is the anticipated competition in products like Wixela, XULANE, PERFOROMIST, all reflected in the -- in our guidance, but that will have an impact in the second half versus first half, and that will have an impact on our gross margin as well. 
And then you have, to a lesser extent, you have some of the COVID-related buying that happened in quarter 2 that's going to step down in quarter 3, quarter 4. Put all those things together, you will see roughly second half revenue to be lower than the first half, though the underlying strength of the business continues. 
Now taking the EBITDA, exactly some of these elements that I mentioned, will have a flow-through impact on the gross margin, even though I expect the gross margin for full year to be in the range of 58% to 59%. The other important item that's having an effect on the EBITDA is the pickup sequentially on SG&A and R&D expenses. And that's all, again, reflected in the guidance. We're expecting the SG&A and R&D to pick up, part of it is COVID, but part of it is deliberate design of investing into the business so that we have, not only achieved our objective for this year, but have a stronger momentum getting into next year. All those are reflecting in the EBITDA for second half to be slightly lower, but again, was strong. 
And on the cash flow, again, the performance, strength and everything continues that I mentioned about it, the working capital improvement initiatives, better cash flow from operations and the higher -- the only offsetting on the cash flow side is the higher CapEx that we expect in the second half versus the first half, which is on the timing of that. So that kind of gives you the sense of the rhythm of all 3 items."

The second piece is the new products, which, without losing every time, we have -- as we said, we have identified about 30 products now. Six of them are scheduled for filing over this year. Three have already been filed, so we are very much on the track. And I think from a regulatory point of view, it takes about 2 to 3 years to get these products over the finish line when it comes to China."

The regulatory landscape has evolved. We've evolved with it, and I think we should be so proud of what we have done as a team in enabling this and being tenacious enough to evolve with it and sticking to it and actually getting this done.
There's significant interest, as you know, from policymakers, from advocacy groups, et cetera, and what this potentially can mean for access for patients. And it's, to be honest, meaningful for me on a personal level because, 20 years ago, I led the global marketing effort for [indiscernible] launch. So I know what this product can do, how good is [ a patient ]. We're excited about -- specifically what this means, and we're excited what this potentially means for patients. And I want to ask Rajiv to comment on the commercial potential and the time line also that we see in rolling this out."

And one other question was about how difficult is interchangeability, and I would say, look, Gary, ideally suited products for interchangeability of a chronically administered biosimilars where disease needs to be relatively stable and with a limited chance of rapid decline, and it's a case by case. And it does include -- the current guidance across for the biosimilars on interchangeability includes pharmacokinetic equivalence after 3 switches of test reference, test versus the reference product. So there is additional work and science involved. 
Now coming back to the launch, very excited and very proud of this achievement. It's a new level with the new NDC and FDA has agreed with us a framework to transition in the interchangeable product while transitioning out the non-interchangeable. And we had agreed also in the time frame of a period of about 6 months to manage this, which aligns well with ramping up our supply of interchangeable markets. 
From a commercial point of view, if anybody knows this market, this market is not just commercial, driven by the just formularies or PBMs. This is made up of Medicare Part D., the second one controlled by the PBMs. The third one, Medicaid, the government, VA hospital, corrections, cash pay and FFS. And every market channel segment has its own dynamics and nuances, so there is no one silver bullet or one strategy to commercialize. 
Our goal would be to basically drive the excess, and we believe that the substitution at the pharmacy level will help us drive that. And we see, from a timing perspective, we see some -- you will see some uptick in the market share around quarter 4, but the actual and the decent impact of interchangeability to the market share perspective and excess will be seen over the next year. 
For us, I see this as a long-term opportunity with a long tail. And interchangeability -- and just one thing I've missed, I think, on your question around how long, we do have 12-month exclusivity for any other interchangeable product to come. So I think I've answered most of your questions."

But on the '22 question, let me just reemphasize again what I also said in my prepared remarks is that we really see the $6.2 billion true floor for this business. I think with the performance we have under our belt now from both the first and the second quarter, it's more clear than ever to us that that's the case. 
We have really strong momentum coming from both, and that's for EBITDA. Clearly, we see cash flow growing. That's because of the continued performance and where we see EBITDA. It's from reduction in onetime costs, and Sanjeev was very clear about where we see legacy Mylan levels by the end of 2023. So you see the improvement that can come from just that factor. 
And then as we've seen in this quarter, I know on capital and cash flow conversion, cash flow very strongly. And then if you ask about revenue, we're not really talking about revenue yet. I mean we are completing the strategy plan that we're doing. That will be completed towards the end of the year.

I'm pleased to say that we have, again, reported another strong quarter, generating robust free cash flow, delivering on our financial commitments and building a strong foundation for our future. 
Nearly 1 year ago today, we formed Viatris with the vision to assemble best-in-class capabilities across commercial, manufacturing, R&D and enabling function in pursuit of removing barriers and expanding access for patients we serve while also returning value to shareholders. Today's continued strong results are a testament to that vision and to the execution of our colleagues around the world whose shared dedication to patients and shareholders drives our strong business results and we believe is putting Viatris on a path for an even stronger future. I could not be proud of all that we have accomplished together. 
Now here are some highlights. In the third quarter, we reported total revenues of USD 4.54 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.7 billion and free cash flow of USD 965 million. Year-to-date, that is quarter 1 through quarter 3 combined, we have generated approximately USD 2.2 billion in free cash flow, already exceeding the lower end of our most recent guidance for the full year. Optimizing cash flow generation will continue to be our financial north star, and we anticipate cash flow to grow in the coming years as a result of our expected continued strong performance, a reduction in onetime costs and continued improvements in cash flow conversion. 
In North America, we're preparing for the imminent launch of Semglee, which, as most of you know, received historic approval from the FDA for the industry's first-ever interchangeable biosimilar designation in the U.S. in July. We expect that Semglee will be available in pharmacies before the end of the year, and we believe this is an important milestone to help increase access to insulin for those living with diabetes in the United States. Rajiv will later provide more details on the progress we're making in that regard.
In addition, at the end of October, we filed a BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA with the FDA as planned. We believe this is the first biosimilar registration of this important medicine to treat age-related macular degeneration. And looking further into the future, we're excited about the potential to be first to market for our BOTOX biosimilar. 
Overall, we generated $158 million in new product revenue in the third quarter, $557 million year-to-date. We're therefore well on track for approximately $690 million in new product revenue for the full year. Importantly, our strong performance enables us to continue to execute on Phase 1 of our strategic road map, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. During this time, we're focused on strengthening our balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders in form of a dividend and building a strong foundation for the future. We're now 1 year into that 3-year effort, and we continue to deliver on our financial commitments for debt repayment, dividend and synergies. 
On the last quarter's earnings call, we said we would reevaluate our 2021 financial guidance at the end of the third quarter. Based on our strong performance to date, we are again raising our financial guidance across total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which Sanjeev will discuss in more detail later. 
I'm also pleased to say that we are near completion of our rigorous bottom-up strategic planning effort. We look forward to sharing the results of these plans with the investment community at a virtual investor event now scheduled for the morning of January 7, 2022. And on that day, we'll provide additional details on our 2-phase strategic road map, including for the rest of Phase 1, that is the years 2022 and 2023. We'll be providing specific financial guidance, targets and metrics to complete this phase. 
We'll also be discussing the substantial free cash flow that we will be generating over this period to satisfy our Phase 1 capital allocation priorities of returning capital to shareholders and of repaying $6.5 billion of debt. And with that said, we continue to remain confident that $6.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA is the true floor of our business. 
For Phase 2 of our road map that's 2024 and beyond, we will provide an overview of the catalysts that we expect will drive future growth, including laying out our capital allocation priorities for the space in order to maximize and further unlock shareholder value during this period. We'll also be giving specific details of our own organic opportunities by discussing our own pipeline at length, and we will be providing the inorganic business development priorities that we'll be focusing on through our Global Healthcare Gateway. 
Before I close, I'd be remiss to not call out that Viatris was recently recognized as a top 5 company on the prestigious Fortune's Change the World list. This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues to stem the tide of HIV/AIDS over the course of more than 10 years, and it's just 1 example of how corporate social responsibility is deeply embedded in our mission and our operating model. And in addition, we were recognized on the Forbes 2021 World's Best Employers list, underscoring our success in laying the foundation for the kind of company we want to be. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv for more details. Rajiv?"

Before I get into the quarter at hand, I would like to echo Michael's excitement about our upcoming investor event. What you can expect to hear from me is a comprehensive review of the significant value and the depth of our pipeline and clinical programs, including biosimilars' complex generics and our medicines that we have been strategically building over many years. 
These development programs are expected to play a significant role in our ability to drive organic growth over time, especially as our cost synergies roll off at the end of 2023. Once laid out in January, we believe our pipeline will be recognized as one of the company's most underappreciated assets that will enable us to continue to deliver value while fulfilling our mission of expanding access and addressing patient needs. 
Now let's get into our results. I'm pleased to report that we have executed 3 strong quarters, which is a testament to our diversified and differentiated commercial and operations platform, but more importantly, the dedication of our workforce. As I walk you through the performance in each of our segments and product categories, I will be making certain comparisons to combined LOE adjusted third quarter 2020 results on a constant currency basis as well as comparisons versus our expectations as included in our guidance back in August. 
Beginning on Slide 7. Overall, the business performed strongly across all of our segments versus our expectations. When excluding the impact of Japan's Lyrica and Celebrex LOEs, as seen on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, total net sales were down 1% as compared to combined LOE adjusted quarter 3 2020 results. Our brand business performed better than our expectations, primarily driven by Lipitor, Influvac and EpiPen. Our complex generics and biosimilar category performed in line with our expectations. We are pleased with the continued growth of our global biosimilars portfolio this quarter, which grew by 14% and helped to offset anticipated competition related to select complex generic products. Lastly, our global generics category also performed in line with our expectations, reflecting mid-single-digit decline compared to the prior year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our market performance was slightly above our expectations for the quarter. Europe continues to perform very well, generating 10% year-over-year growth in net sales, driven by strong performance by brands like Influvac, Lipitor and Dymista, as well as the strong performance of our thrombosis portfolio. Biosimilars in Europe grew by over 50%, led by our strong position of Hulio in Germany. 
Moving to North America. We are very pleased with our overall performance. Our branded segment performed strongly, driven by EpiPen, Yupelri and a better-than-expected performance of PERFOROMIST. These results were partially offset by [indiscernible] which experienced unanticipated competition. Complex generics and biosimilars in North America was better than our expectations with strong performance in biosimilars, which helped to absorb the competitive impact on Wixela and XULANE. 
I would also like to make a few comments on U.S. generics business and pricing. For the last few years, we have continued to work on our portfolio by investing in science and difficult-to-make dosage forms like injectables, dermatologicals, patches and drug device combinations while pruning certain commodity products at the same time. We believe we now have a well-diversified generics portfolio, which is being very well supported by our strong customer service levels. This is what differentiates our ability to effectively manage this business. 
Accordingly, as we normalize this quarter for exceptional onetime events like Fumarate, Wixela and XULANE, our price erosion for this quarter is mid-single digits and very much in line with our expectations. We are also excited about the upcoming launch of our branded product, injection and unbranded insulin glargine injection. Both products will be available in pen and presentations and are interchangeable for the reference brand This dual-product approach is intended to ensure that this interchangeable biosimilar insulin can reach as many patients as possible regardless of financial circumstances, insurance or channel. 
We are pleased with some recent formulary wins that go into effect on January 1, 2022, including the inclusion of our interchangeable biosimilar assembly on Express Scripts National Preferred Formulary as well as on Prime Therapeutics national formularies. We expect that the products will be available in pharmacies before the end of the year. To ensure that as many patients as possible will benefit from these products, we will provide co-pay assistance, a patient assistance program and cash pay alternatives. In addition, beginning in '22, we will be a participant in the CMS Medicare Part D Senior Savings Model, which limits certain patients' out-of-pocket cost to no more than $1.35 for 1-month supply. 
Moving to the next slide. Our emerging market segment also performed in line with our expectations this quarter. Our branded business, primarily driven by Vitra and Lipitor continues to perform strongly in these countries that have begun to recover from COVID. In this quarter, our complex generics and biosimilars category performed below our expectations due to the COVID-19-related regulatory delays, which we expect to overcome as we close out the year. Our generics business was in line with our expectations. We had higher-than-anticipated sales of remdesivir and AmBisome this quarter that helped offset the lower ARV volume. We expect that the demand for COVID-19-related products to taper off in quarter 4. 
The next slide shows our segment. We are pleased with this quarter's performance across our product categories with brands and generics performing better than expectations. Amitiza, Lyrica and Creon drove strong brand results, and our authorized generics to Lyrica and Norvasc continued to contribute growth. Biosimilars were in line with the expectations with continued strong performance from Hulio in Japan. 
Greater China is our last segment slide and the business had another strong quarter, delivering results that were better than our expectations. This performance was primarily driven by retail channel growth of 20% and better-than-expected performance in the hospital channel. The segment benefited from some phasing of customer buying patterns this quarter that we expect to normalize in quarter 4. Overall, we are very pleased with how the business is navigating the evolving policy environment. 
With our new launches performing to our expectations and our base business anticipated to be in line with our expectations of approximately a 4% base business erosion for the year, I feel very strong about the underlying building blocks of this business. 
Now turning to the pipeline update. Regarding our BOTOX biosimilar development program, we met with FDA in early September and aligned on analytical nonclinical data as well as a clinical program expectations and have a clear path forward. At this juncture, we do not expect Revance 483 and a Complete Response Letter related to their product to impact our submission timing for this program, which is scheduled to be filed by the end of 2024. We will provide an additional update when we have more information. 
Additionally, we recently submitted to FDA what we believe is potentially the first EYLEA biosimilar. Moving to [indiscernible] part, FDA completed a preapproval inspection of Biocon's manufacturing facility in Malaysia. It resulted in a few minor 483 observations, and Biocon has provided a complete and comprehensive response to FDA's 483. We are confident that we will hear soon from the agency as this is the last remaining element needed for approval of another potentially interchangeable insulin product. 
Regarding Avastin, our U.S. approval continues to be impacted by the delay of a preapproval inspection. As previously mentioned, we have no open scientific questions with FDA. In our complex product pipeline, we have initiated our XULANE low-dose Phase III clinical trial and are actively screening and enrolling patients. We are also happy that our levothyroxine solution was accepted for filing with FDA. 
This quarter, we made good progress in our complex injectables portfolio. We successfully completed pivotal pharmacokinetic studies for our long-acting opioid acetate injection and have demonstrated that our product is to sandostatin. Our paliperidone palmitate 3-month ANDA for 410-milligram and 273-milligram strength have now been accepted for filing, and we believe that we are the first to file for all strengths of the paliperidone 3-month injection [indiscernible] to INVEGA TRINSA. We have also successfully completed our pivotal PK study for aripiprazole modified release injection, which is our generic for Abilify Maintena. 
Before I hand it over to Sanjeev, I'll quickly address our ongoing integration and restructuring activities. We are coming up on our 1-year anniversary and our initiatives are progressing as planned. We continue to remain on track to realize $100 million of cost synergies this year and are confident in our overall plans to achieve at least $1 billion of cost synergies by 2023. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."

As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another excellent quarter, and I'm really pleased with the focus and execution exemplified by our team, especially the financial results. The results demonstrate the financial s",1087,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another excellent quarter, and I'm really pleased with the focus and execution exemplified by our team, especially the financial results. The results demonstrate the financial strength and the nature of our global diversified platform. In the slides ahead, I'll provide drivers for Q3 and expectations for Q4 that are leading to an increase in our current year financial guidance. 
On Slide 17, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's stand-alone results for third quarter 2020. Moving to Slide 18. This is a comparison of combined adjusted Q3 2020 results, which includes Mylan's stand-alone results and Upjohn's carveout financials for a period of July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, adjusted for certain LOEs and transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with the combination. 
Beginning with LOEs. As we've seen throughout the year, our commercial teams have continued to manage the rate of erosion of Lyrica and Celebrex in Japan. As a result, generic penetration levels have come in slightly better than our expectations. Adjusting for these LOEs, total reported net sales in the quarter were essentially flat to prior year. In the quarter, our branded business performed solidly, driven by thrombosis and Influvac in Europe and EpiPen in North America. 
In China, sales were strong for both Lipitor and Norvasc in the hospital channel and in the retail channel. Our team continues to navigate the policy environment and erosion from VBP was in line with expectations. New product revenue was in line with expectation and our global biosimilar sales grew 14%. Base business erosion includes price and volume decline in our North American generics business, including competition across complex products such as Wixela, XULANE and our generic for 
Coupled with declines in our ARV business in emerging markets, on balance, these items are tracking in line with our expectation and full year assumption is unchanged at approximately 4%. We're seeing a gradual recovery from COVID in emerging markets, North America and Europe. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, the weaker dollar relative to key currencies such as euro provide an approximately 1% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 revenue results. 
Moving to Slide 19, which bridges adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter, adjusted gross margin of approximately 60% came in ahead of expectations and were driven by brand performance and favorable cost of goods. Integration and restructuring activities remain on track and SG&A was in line with expectations. 
Turning to Slide 20. Free cash flow of $965 million exceeded our expectation due to strong operational performance and cash flow improvement initiatives. Onetime costs were lower due to timing of activities between quarter 3 and quarter 4 and capital expenditure came in below our expectations, partially due to COVID-related global supply chain delays. 
As a result of strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, we've been able to repay $1.9 billion of debt year-to-date, including $730 million in quarter 3. We've also returned $266 million in dividends to our shareholders. These actions are consistent with our Phase 1 capital allocation priorities of repaying $6.5 billion of debt by 2023 and returning capital through our dividend, which we expect to grow in future, subject to Board approval. As we look to Q4, we expect free cash flow to be significantly reduced from Q3 levels due to lower adjusted EBITDA, phasing of onetime cash costs, semiannual interest payments and ramp-up of capital expenditure. 
Moving to Slide 22. Based on the underlying strength in the business, we're raising the guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The midpoint of increased total revenue guidance is now $17.8 billion, an increase of $100 million versus prior guidance. The increased outlook of revenue reflects the continued strength in our China business, driven by pull-through of retail convergence strategy. Performance in developed markets benefited from strong EpiPen back-to-school season and Influvac volumes in Europe, partially offsetting these positive trends, including generic erosion and competition of key products in North America and lower ARV volumes in emerging markets. 
The midpoint of an increased adjusted EBITDA guidance is now at $6.4 billion, also up $100 million versus prior guidance. The increase is primarily driven by higher forecasted total revenue in addition to our expectation that gross -- adjusted gross margin would land closer to the high end of our range at 58% to 59% for 2021. For adjusted SG&A, we expect a sequential increase in fourth quarter with the resumption of activities due to COVID recovery in various markets, bringing our full year range of this key measure to 21% to 22% of total revenue. 
The midpoint of free cash flow guidance is increasing to $2.5 billion, which is $200 million higher than previous guidance. This reflects capital expenditure of approximately $500 million, lower cash tax and cash improvement initiatives that we expect to continue to benefit us in 2022 and beyond. 
Now a few comments on Q4. For revenue, we expect a sequential decline due to customer buying pattern that benefited in Q3, lower sales of EpiPen in developed market and lower sales of remdesivir and AmBisome in emerging markets. For adjusted gross margin, we also expect a sequential step-down from Q3 to Q4 from 60% to approximately 58% due to the evolution of our product portfolio mix. 
I'm extremely pleased with our ability to generate substantial free cash flows, and we fully expect our operational momentum exiting 2021 will carry into next year. Based on additional cash flow improvement initiatives and the expected reduction in onetime cash costs, we're highly confident on our clear pathway to generate an aggregate of over $8 billion of free cash flow from '21 to '23 that will satisfy our Phase 1 capital allocation priorities. The underlying strength and momentum we see in the business position us for a solid starting point heading into 2022, and we look forward to sharing more about 2-phase strategic road map in early January. 
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to announce that our Head of Investor Relations, Melissa Trombetta, is moving to a broader leadership role in our office of business performance. We sincerely appreciate all her contribution over the past 4.5 years, leading the IR function.

I guess my question here was, I think in the past, you've talked about 2021 as a trough number. I know you've raised the guidance a few times to have gone through this year. 
So let me just understand a little bit what's going on here. Some of the upside we're seeing, I guess, more onetime in nature this year or are there any other factors that contribute to that dynamic? I'm just trying to kind of bridge between, I guess, a new midpoint of $6.4 billion versus that floor, $6.2 billion. 
If I can slip a really quick second question in. I guess my question is you think about like capital deployment and where your stock is right now, where does repo -- share repo fit into the mix? And I think there's been a lot of discussion around like BD and/or dividends, but just trying to get a sense of, is share repo something that you're considering as well?"

Let me start with your second question on the share buybacks. Just to go back, I mean, for us, as part of our TSR framework from the beginning, we always contemplated those dividends and share repurchases, right? That was always part of our thinking. I think we've been very, very clear about what our priorities are for Phase 1, which is the years '21, '22 and 23. And that's the debt pay down, $6.5 billion, returning capital through dividend and then growing the dividend annually, right? 
If there are additional opportunities, obviously, we'll consider it. Share buybacks will always be the benchmark for any kind of major BD investments that we do. And then just 1 other factor that you may not be aware of that we have to consider is there is a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Pfizer as part of the tax-free spin of Upjohn from Pfizer and then the combination with Mylan. And there are certain limitations and conditions on share buybacks in the first 2 years that we need to take into consideration. 
But I look forward to telling you more not only about the Phase 1 commitment, we made it very clear, but also our capital deployment priorities for Phase 2, how we do that and how we maximize shareholder value and unlock further shareholder value in Phase II. So that's worth coming and please join us in the January meeting. 
On the EBITDA question you have, clearly, we're not giving guidance today. We're very, very pleased with the performance that we have, now 3 consecutive quarters. We strongly feel that we stabilize this business. We got a good handle on the business. We now finished or almost finished the bottom-up rigorous strategic planning process. And with that, we're reconfirming again what we said before, the $6.2 billion is the floor. That means floor. It doesn't mean that's part of the guidance. It's the floor. 
But that's a floor that's very, very important because that drives how we can deliver on Phase I, right? We laid out our clear priorities, what we need to do. EBITDA drives cash flow is not the only thing that driving cash flow, it's one of the things driving cash flow and remain confident that the EBITDA combined with, and you can easily do the math yourself, $8 billion or more in cash flow over those 3 years, sets us up to deliver on our Phase 1 commitments. We remain confident we can do so. 
And look just at this year, $2.5 billion midpoint already. And that sets us up really for a very successful Phase II with a much stronger balance sheet, much more increased financial flexibility and firepower. And I look forward to telling you more about that at our investor event."

And this is where the focus for the future is that we continue to shift our focus and build our momentum around the retail channel, which is growing to a -- this quarter also, it was 20%-plus growth. 
But as China was, we always said that although we are not providing guidance, but we knew that China is going to be a step down, whether it's a year 1 or 2, given the implementation of URP. In fact, recently, there has been some updates on the -- at the policy level in China, where we are pleased that in a perverse way, it has provided us some very clear clarity about the timing and the extent, and we see this bottoming out of the China business or hospital business by '24, '25. That gives us a great runway to continue to implement our business and move the business where we need to move and focus and build the portfolio around the retail. So that's about China. 
And as well as Semglee, I think the launch of the 2 products, the dual-product launch is intended to ensure that this interchangeable product can reach as many patients as possible regardless of financial circumstances, insurance or channel.

So Balaji, interchangeability, if I were to characterize the interchangeability of Humira, I will put it in a nice-to-have bucket rather than a must-have bucket for a number of reasons. So first of all, as you know, as the market formation happens, nobody will have the advantage of interchangeability as Amgen or the #2 player will not have interchangeability at that point of time. 
But more importantly, the difference between insulin and Humira is about insulin is a pharmacy product whereas Humira is a specialty pharmacy product, where the point of dispensing, you have a lot better control and interaction between the doctor and the patient, ongoing interaction. 
At the same time also, today, nobody will have interchangeability for all the presentations, the low concentration, the high concentration, the pen versus a preferred syringe. So there will be -- somebody will have maybe Boehringer has one for the strength for the lower concentration but not for all. So -- and even if it's a, let's say, nice to have, you can expect us that it's such an important product, by the time the first exclusivity expires, the interchangeability exclusivity expires, which will be somewhere in the '24 [indiscernible] we might have -- we will be having that interchangeability. We will go after and complete that interchangeability work."

Navann, we're very pleased with the cash flow generation in the company and all the effort and the focus that we have on the cash flow in terms of that. So what's going on in terms of where we are looking at kind of the opportunity? So first is, obviously, the operational rhythm of the business is better, as Michael and Rajiv pointed out. So that's obviously helping on that. 
Then on top of that, as a company, we've implemented a very comprehensive cash optimization program as we brought the 2 companies together. So we looked at every element of the balance sheet, as you would expect that. We looked at where net working capital is deployed, whether it's accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory and other working capital. We looked at that, we looked at the best practices in the both company and obviously trying to gravitate towards the best practice. 
And we're looking at the industry as well. So we came up with a program that we are kind of implementing it right now. We also did is we looked at the operational metrics and had each of the asset owner start driving those that we can see the benefit on that. The bottom line of this is a very sustainable program at the grassroot levels in the organization. Not only I see, Navann, the benefit this year but I see the benefit getting into next year and year after that. 
And as the onetime costs come down, which we're expecting that to come down next year and year after that, I see a cash flow -- free cash flow to improve next year and the year after that. And that will then satisfy -- we'll have enough cash flow of over $8 billion to satisfy Phase 1 commitment of debt pay down and paying and growing dividend, subject to Board approval."

Specifically for the EBITDA, that the question that you asked, if we look at the kind of the step down in the revenue, which is all due to the expected events that I explained that there is a flow-through of the EBITDA going down, there is a gross margin pressure. I talked about that because of the evolving product mix, and then you have some onetime events on the COGS line. 
The other thing that's also happening in Q4, which is obviously impacting the EBITDA level is the step-up in the SG&A line. As we are as seeing the world recovering from core, there is going to be a step-up in the SG&A expenses, which actually helps us position well not only this year but sets up well for the next year. So all that is planned and expected. But bottom line, there's nothing that is of concern to me about what's happening in Q4 for that matter."

Nearly 1 year ago today, we formed Viatris with the vision to assemble best-in-class capabilities across commercial, manufacturing, R&D and enabling function in pursuit of removing barriers and expanding access for patients we serve while also returning value to shareholders. Today's continued strong results are a testament to that vision and to the execution of our colleagues around the world who shared dedication to patients and shareholders, drives our strong business results and we believe is putting Viatris on a path for an even stronger future. I could not be proud of all that we have accomplished together.
Now here are some highlights. In the third quarter, we reported total revenues of USD 4.54 billion, adjusted EBITDA of USD 1.7 billion and free cash flow of USD 965 million. Year-to-date, that is quarter 1 through quarter 3 combined, we have generated approximately USD 2.2 billion in free cash flow, already exceeding the lower end of our most recent guidance for the full year. Optimizing cash flow generation will continue to be our financial North Star, and we anticipate cash flow to grow in the coming years as a result of our expected continued strong performance, a reduction in onetime costs and continued improvements in cash flow conversion.
In North America, we're preparing for the imminent launch of Semglee, which, as most of you know, received a historic approval from the FDA for the industry's first-ever interchangeable biosimilar designation in the U.S. in July. We expect that Semglee will be available in pharmacies before the end of the year, and we believe this is an important milestone to help increase access to insulin for those living with diabetes in the United States. Rajiv will later provide more details on the progress we're making in that regard.
In addition, at the end of October, we filed a BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA with the FDA as planned. We believe this is the first biosimilar registration of this important medicine to treat age-related macular degeneration. And looking further into the future, we're excited about the potential to be first-to-market for our BOTOX biosimilar. Overall, we generated $158 million in new product revenue in the third quarter, $557 million year-to-date, and we're, therefore, well on track for approximately $690 million in new product revenue for the full year.
Importantly, our strong performance enables us to continue to execute on Phase I of our strategic road map, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. During this time, we're focused on strengthening our balance sheet, returning capital to shareholders in form of a dividend and building a strong foundation for the future. We're now 1 year into that 3-year effort, and we continue to deliver on our financial commitments with debt repayment, dividend and synergies.
On the last quarter's earnings call, we said we would reevaluate our 2021 financial guidance at the end of the third quarter. Based on our strong performance to date, we are, again, raising our financial guidance across total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which Sanjeev will discuss in more detail later. I'm also pleased to say that we are near completion of our rigorous bottom-up strategic planning effort.
We look forward to sharing the results of these plans with the investment community at a virtual investor event now scheduled for the morning of January 7, 2022. And on that day, we'll provide additional details on our 2-phase strategic road map, including for the rest of Phase I, that is the years 2022 and 2023, we'll be providing specific financial guidance, targets and metrics to complete this phase. We'll also be discussing the substantial free cash flow that we will be generating over this period to satisfy our Phase I capital allocation priorities of returning capital to shareholders and of repaying $6.5 billion of debt. And with that said, we continue to remain confident that $6.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA is the true floor of our business.
For Phase II of our road map that's 2024 and beyond, we will provide an overview of the catalysts that we expect will drive future growth, including laying out our capital allocation priorities for the space in order to maximize and further unlock shareholder value during this period. We'll also be giving specific details of our own organic opportunities by discussing our own pipeline at length, and we will be providing the inorganic business development priorities that we'll be focusing on through our Global Healthcare Gateway.
Before I close, I'd be remiss to not call out that Viatris was recently recognized as a top 5 company on the prestigious Fortune's Change the World list. This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our colleagues to stem the tide of HIV/AIDS over the course of more than 10 years, and it's just one example of how corporate social responsibility is deeply embedded in our mission and our operating model. And in addition, we were recognized on the Forbes 2021 World's Best Employers list, underscoring our success in laying the foundation for the kind of company we want to be.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rajiv for more details. Rajiv?"

Before I get into the quarter at hand, I would like to echo Michael's excitement about our upcoming investor event. What you can expect to hear from me is a comprehensive review of the significant value and the depth of our pipeline and clinical programs, including biosimilars, complex generics and our medicines that we have been strategically building over many years. These development programs are expected to play a significant role in our ability to drive organic growth over time, especially as our cost synergies roll off at the end of 2023. Once laid out in January, we believe our pipeline will be recognized as one of the company's most underappreciated assets that will enable us to continue to deliver value while fulfilling our mission of expanding access and addressing patient needs.
Now let's get into our results. I'm pleased to report that we have executed 3 strong quarters, which is a testament to our diversified and differentiated commercial and operations platform but more importantly, the dedication of our workforce. As I walk you through the performance in each of our segments and product categories, I will be making certain comparisons to combined LOE-adjusted third quarter 2020 results on a constant currency basis as well as comparisons versus our expectations as included in our guidance back in August.
Beginning on Slide 7. Overall, the business performed strongly across all of our segments versus our expectations. When excluding the impact of Japan's Lyrica and Celebrex LOEs, as seen on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, total net sales were down 1% as compared to combined LOE adjusted quarter 3 2020 results. Our brands business performed better than our expectations, primarily driven by Lipitor, Viagra, Influvac and EpiPen. Our complex generics and biosimilar category performed in line with our expectations. We are pleased with the continued growth of our global biosimilars portfolio this quarter, which grew by 14% and helped to offset anticipated competition related to select complex generics products. Lastly, our global generics category also performed in line with our expectations, reflecting mid-single-digit decline compared to the prior year.
Turning to Slide 8. Our developed markets performance was slightly above our expectations for the quarter. Europe continues to perform very well, generating 10% year-over-year growth in net sales driven by strong performance by brands like Influvac, Lipitor and Dymista as well as the strong performance of our thrombosis portfolio. Biosimilars in Europe grew by over 50% led by our strong position of Hulio in Germany.
Moving to North America, we are very pleased with our overall performance. Our branded segment performed strongly, driven by EpiPen, Yupelri and a better-than-expected performance of PERFOROMIST. These results were partially offset by Miacalcin, which experienced unanticipated competition. Complex generics and biosimilars in North America was better than our expectations with strong performance in biosimilars, which helped to absorb the competitive impact on Wixela and XULANE.
I would also like to make a few comments on U.S. generics business and pricing. For the last few years, we have continued to work on our portfolio by investing in science and difficult-to-make dosage forms like injectables, dermatologicals, patches and drug-device combinations while pruning certain commodity products at the same time. We believe we now have a well-diversified generics portfolio, which is being very well supported by our strong customer service levels. This is what differentiates our ability to effectively manage this business.
Accordingly, as we normalize this quarter for exceptional onetime events like dimethyl fumarate, Wixela and XULANE, our price erosion for this quarter is mid-single digits and very much in line with our expectations. We are also excited about the upcoming launch of our branded product, Semglee injection and unbranded insulin glargine injection. Both products will be available in pen and vial presentations and are interchangeable for the reference brand Lantus. This dual-product approach is intended to ensure that this interchangeable biosimilar insulin can reach as many patients as possible regardless of financial circumstances, insurance or channel.
We are pleased with some recent formulary wins that go into effect on January 1, 2022, including the inclusion of our interchangeable biosimilar assembly on Express Scripts National Preferred Formulary as well as on Prime Therapeutics national formularies. We expect that the products will be available in pharmacies before the end of the year. To ensure that as many patients as possible will benefit from these products, we will provide co-pay assistance, a patient assistance program, and cash-pay alternatives. In addition, beginning in '22, we will be a participant in the CMS Medicare Part D Senior Savings Model, which limits certain patients' out-of-pocket costs to no more than $1.35 for 1-month supply.
Moving to the next slide. Our emerging markets segment also performed in line with our expectations this quarter. Our branded business, primarily driven by Viagra and Lipitor, continues to perform strongly in these countries that have begun to recover from COVID. In this quarter, our complex generics and biosimilars category performed below our expectations due to the COVID-19-related regulatory delays, which we expect to overcome as we close out the year. Our generics business was in line with our expectations.
We had higher-than-anticipated sales of remdesivir and AmBisome this quarter that helped offset the lower ARV volume. We expect that the demand for COVID-19-related products to taper off in quarter 4.
The next slide shows our JANZ segment. We are pleased with this quarter's performance across our product categories with brands and generics performing better than expectations. Amitiza, Lyrica and Creon drove strong brand results, and our authorized generics to Lyrica and Norvasc continued to contribute growth. Biosimilars were in line with the expectations with continued strong performance from Hulio in Japan.
Greater China is our last segment slide, and the business had another strong quarter, delivering results that were better than our expectations. This performance was primarily driven by retail channel growth of 20% and better-than-expected performance in the hospital channel. The segment benefited from some phasing of customer buying patterns this quarter that we expect to normalize in quarter 4. Overall, we are very pleased with how the business is navigating the evolving policy environment.
With our new launches performing to our expectations and our base business anticipated to be in line with our expectations of approximately a 4% base business erosion for the year, I feel very strong about the underlying building blocks of this business.
Now turning to the pipeline update. Regarding our BOTOX biosimilar development program, we met with FDA in early September and aligned on analytical, nonclinical data as well as a clinical program expectations and have a clear path forward. At this juncture, we do not expect Revance 483 and a complete response letter related to their Daxi product to impact our submission timing for this program, which is scheduled to be filed by the end of 2024. We will provide an additional update when we have more information.
Additionally, we recently submitted to FDA what we believe is potentially the first EYLEA biosimilar. Moving to insulin aspart, FDA completed a pre-approval inspection of Biocon's manufacturing facility in Malaysia. It resulted in a few minor 483 observations, and Biocon has provided a complete and comprehensive response to FDA's 483. We are confident that we will hear soon from the agency as this is the last remaining element needed for approval of another potentially interchangeable insulin product.
Regarding Avastin, our U.S. approval continues to be impacted by the delay of a pre-approval inspection. As previously mentioned, we have no open scientific questions with FDA. In our complex product pipeline, we have initiated our XULANE low-dose Phase III clinical trial and are actively screening and enrolling patients. We are also happy that our levothyroxine oral solution was accepted for filing with FDA.
This quarter, we made good progress in our complex injectables portfolio. We successfully completed pivotal pharmacokinetic studies for our long-acting octreotide acetate injection and have demonstrated that our product is parallel to Sandostatin. Our paliperidone palmitate 3-month ANDA for 410-milligram and 273-milligram strength have now been accepted for filing, and we believe that we are the first to file for all strengths of the paliperidone 3-month lipo injection equivalent to INVEGA TRINSA. We have also successfully completed our pivotal PK study for aripiprazole modified release injection, which is our generic equivalent for Abilify Maintena.
Before I hand it over to Sanjeev, I'll quickly address our ongoing integration and restructuring activities. We are coming up on our 1-year anniversary, and our initiatives are progressing as planned. We continue to remain on track to realize $500 million of cost synergies this year and are confident in our overall plans to achieve at least $1 billion of cost synergies by 2023.
Let me now turn the call over to Sanjeev. Thank you."
290203,1685038429,2429811,"Viatris Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 08, 2021",2021-11-08,"Earnings Calls","Viatris Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another excellent quarter, and I'm really pleased with the focus and execution exemplified by our team, especially the financial results. The results demonstrate the financial s",1090,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Michael and Rajiv mentioned, we had another excellent quarter, and I'm really pleased with the focus and execution exemplified by our team, especially the financial results. The results demonstrate the financial strength and the nature of our global diversified platform. In the slides ahead, I'll provide drivers for Q3 and expectations for Q4 that are leading to an increase in our current year financial guidance.
On Slide 17, we have summarized our results versus prior year on a reported basis, which reflects Mylan's stand-alone results for third quarter 2020. Moving to Slide 18. This is a comparison of combined adjusted Q3 2020 results, which includes Mylan's stand-alone results and Upjohn's carve-out financials for a period of July 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, adjusted for certain LOEs and transaction-related items, including divested products in connection with the combination.
Beginning with LOEs. As we've seen throughout the year, our commercial teams have continued to manage the rate of erosion of Lyrica and Celebrex in Japan. As a result, generic penetration levels have come in slightly better than our expectations. Adjusting for these LOEs, total reported net sales in the quarter were essentially flat to prior year. In the quarter, our branded business performed solidly driven by thrombosis and Influvac in Europe and EpiPen in North America.
In China, sales were strong for both Lipitor and Norvasc in the hospital channel and wider in the retail channel. Our team continues to navigate the policy environment, and erosion from VBP was in line with expectations. New product revenue was in line with expectation, and our global biosimilar sales grew 14%. Base business erosion includes price and volume decline in our North American generics business, including competition across complex products such as Wixela, XULANE, Miacalcin and our generic for Tecfidera. Coupled with declines in our ARV business in emerging markets, on balance, these items are tracking in line with our expectation, and full year assumption is unchanged at approximately 4%. We're seeing a gradual recovery from COVID in emerging markets, North America and Europe. Lastly, with respect to foreign exchange, the weaker dollar relative to key currencies such as euro provide an approximately 1% tailwind compared to our combined adjusted 2020 revenue results.
Moving to Slide 19, which bridges adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter, adjusted gross margin of approximately 60% came in ahead of expectations and were driven by brand performance and favorable cost of goods. Integration and restructuring activities remain on track, and SG&A was in line with expectations.
Turning to Slide 20. Free cash flow of $965 million exceeded our expectation due to strong operational performance and cash flow improvement initiatives. Onetime costs were lower due to timing of activities between quarter 3 and quarter 4, and capital expenditure came in below our expectations, partially due to COVID-related global supply chain delays.
As a result of strong year-to-date free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, we've been able to repay $1.9 billion of debt year-to-date, including $730 million in quarter 3. We've also returned $266 million in dividends to our shareholders. These actions are consistent with our Phase I capital allocation priorities of repaying $6.5 billion of debt by 2023 and returning capital through our dividend, which we expect to grow in future, subject to Board approval. As we look to Q4, we expect free cash flow to be significantly reduced from Q3 levels due to lower adjusted EBITDA, phasing of onetime cash costs, semiannual interest payments and ramp-up of capital expenditure.
Moving to Slide 22. Based on the underlying strength in the business, we're raising the guidance for total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The midpoint of increased total revenue guidance is now $17.8 billion, an increase of $100 million versus prior guidance. The increased outlook of revenue reflects the continued strength in our China business driven by pull-through of retail convergence strategy. Performance in developed markets benefited from strong EpiPen back-to-school season and Influvac volumes in Europe, partially offsetting these positive trends, including generic erosion and competition of key products in North America and lower ARV volumes in emerging markets.
The midpoint of an increased adjusted EBITDA guidance is now at $6.4 billion, also up $100 million versus prior guidance. The increase is primarily driven by higher forecasted total revenue, in addition to our expectation that gross -- adjusted gross margin would land closer to the high end of our range at 58% to 59% for 2021. For adjusted SG&A, we expect a sequential increase in fourth quarter with the resumption of activities due to COVID recovery in various markets, bringing a full year range of this key measure to 21% to 22% of total revenue.
The midpoint of free cash flow guidance is increasing to $2.5 billion, which is $200 million higher than previous guidance. This reflects capital expenditure of approximately $500 million, lower cash tax and cash improvement initiatives that we expect to continue to benefit us in 2022 and beyond.
Now a few comments on Q4. For revenue, we expect a sequential decline due to customer buying pattern that benefited in Q3, lower sales of EpiPen in developed markets and lower sales of remdesivir and AmBisome in emerging markets. For adjusted gross margin, we also expect a sequential step-down from Q3 to Q4 from 60% to approximately 58% due to the evolution of our product portfolio mix.
I'm extremely pleased with our ability to generate substantial free cash flows, and we fully expect our operational momentum exiting 2021 will carry into next year. Based on additional cash flow improvement initiatives and the expected reduction in onetime cash costs, we're highly confident on our clear pathway to generate an aggregate of over $8 billion of free cash flow from '21 to '23 that will satisfy our Phase I capital allocation priorities. The underlying strength and momentum we see in the business position us for a solid starting point heading into 2022, and we look forward to sharing more about 2-phase strategic road map in early January.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'd like to announce that our Head of Investor Relations, Melissa Trombetta, is moving to a broader leadership role in our office of business performance. We sincerely appreciate all her contribution over the past 4.5 years leading the IR function. Going forward, Bill Szablewski, Head of Capital Market and Luis Sanay, Director of Investor Relations, will be the main contact for the investor community.

I guess my question here was, I think in the past, you've talked about 2021 as a trough number. I know you've raised the guidance a few times have gone through this year. So let me just understand a little bit what's going on here. Some of the upside we're seeing, I guess, more onetime in nature this year. Or are there any other factors that contribute to that dynamic? I'm just trying to kind of bridge between, I guess, a new midpoint of $6.4 billion versus that floor $6.2 billion.
If I can slip a really quick second question in. I guess my question is, when you're thinking about like capital deployment and where your stock is right now, where does repos -- share repo fit into the mix? And I think there's been a lot of discussion around like BD and/or dividends. But just trying to sense -- get a sense of, is share repo something that you're considering as well?"

Let me start with your second question on the share buybacks. Just to go back, I mean, for us, as part of our TSR framework, from the beginning, we always contemplated those dividends and share repurchases, right? That was",472,"Chris, thanks for the question. Let me start with your second question on the share buybacks. Just to go back, I mean, for us, as part of our TSR framework, from the beginning, we always contemplated those dividends and share repurchases, right? That was always part of our thinking. I think we've been very, very clear about what our priorities are for Phase I, which is the years '21, '22 and '23. And that's the debt paydown, $6.5 billion, returning capital through dividend and then growing the dividend annually, right?
If there are additional opportunities, obviously, we'll consider it. Share buybacks will always be the benchmark for any kind of major BD investments that we do. And then just one other factor that you may not be aware of that we have to consider is there is a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Pfizer as part of the tax-free spin of Upjohn from Pfizer and then the combination with Mylan. And there are certain limitations and conditions on share buybacks in the first 2 years that we need to take into consideration.
But I look forward to telling you more not only about the Phase I commitment, we made it very clear, but also our capital deployment priorities for Phase II, how we do that and how we maximize shareholder value and unlock further shareholder value in Phase II. So that's worth coming, and please join us in the January meeting.
On the EBITDA question you have, clearly, we're not giving guidance today. We're very, very pleased with the performance that we have, now 3 consecutive quarters. We strongly feel that we stabilize this business. We got a good handle on the business. We now finished or almost finished the bottom-up rigorous strategic planning process. And with that, we're reconfirming again what we said before, the $6.2 billion is the floor. That means floor. It doesn't mean that's part of the guidance. It's a floor.
But that's a floor that's very, very important because that drives how we can deliver on Phase I, right? We laid out our clear priorities, what we need to do. EBITDA drives cash flow, it's not the only thing that's driving cash flow, it's one of the things driving cash flow, and remain confident that the EBITDA, combined with, and you can easily do the math yourself, $8 billion or more in cash flow over those 3 years, sets us up to deliver on our Phase I commitments. We remain confident we can do so.
And look just at this year, $2.5 billion midpoint already. And that sets us up really for a very successful Phase II with a much stronger balance sheet, much more increased financial flexibility and firepower. And I look forward to telling you more about that at our investor event."

It looks like it's unimpacted. The URP price impact probably pushed out to next year, arguably, which is probably the big swing factor with the floor -- EBITDA floor as we think about that next year. So I'm just curious, are you seeing anything on the China retail side, which has been a growth story, that suggests some of this upside that you're seeing in China in '21 is sustainable?
And if I could just squeeze in a point of clarification. There was mention about out-of-pocket assistance on Semglee, which I would think of, as a generic, having negligible patient out-of-pocket costs. So if you could just provide some clarity on what the co-pay differential would look like on a Semglee versus an established brand, that'd be helpful."

Yes, we have done -- the team has done a great job of shifting the -- maximizing what they have in the hospital channel. We are doing better than our expectations in the hospital channel as well as the growth in the retail channel. And this is where the focus for the future is that we continue to shift our focus and build our momentum around the retail channel, which is growing to a -- this quarter also, it was 20%-plus growth.
But as China evolves, we always said that -- although we are not providing guidance, but we knew that China is going to be a step-down, whether it's a year 1 or 2, given the implementation of URP. In fact, recently, there has been some updates on the -- at the policy level in China where we are pleased that, in a perverse way, it has provided us some very clear clarity about the timing and the extent, and we see this bottoming out of the China business or hospital business by '24, '25. That gives us a great runway to continue to implement our business and move the business where we need to move and focus and build the portfolio around the retail. So that's about China.
And as well as Semglee, I think the launch of the 2 products, the dual-product launch is intended to ensure that this interchangeable product can reach as many patients as possible regardless of financial circumstances, insurance or channel. And we just want to be at par or -- not any of the patient should be going back from the pharmacy point or dispensing point because they don't have an equivalent co-pay assistance or patient assistance program or a cash-pay alternative. So we are trying to match every -- get every patient and provide them whatever we can provide or whatever they are getting today from a Sanofi product."

So Balaji, interchangeability, if I were to characterize the interchangeability of Humira, I will put it in a nice-to-have bucket rather than a must-have bucket for a number of reasons. So first of all, as you know, as the market formation happens, nobody will have the advantage of interchangeability as Amgen or the #2 player will not have interchangeability at that point of time. But more importantly, the difference between an insulin aspart and Humira is about insulin is a pharmacy product whereas Humira is a specialty pharmacy product, where the point of dispensing, you have a lot better control and interaction between the doctor and the patient, so ongoing interaction.
At the same time also, today, nobody will have interchangeability for all the presentation, the low concentration, the high concentration, the pen versus a preferred syringe. So there will be -- somebody will have a -- maybe Boehringer has one for the strength for the lower concentration but not for all. So -- and even if it's a, let's say, nice-to-have, you can expect us that it's such an important product. By the time the first exclusivity expires, the interchangeability exclusivity expires, which will be somewhere in the '24 order, we might have -- we will be having that interchangeability.

So that's obviously helping on that.
Then on top of that, as a company, we've implemented a very comprehensive cash optimization program as we brought the 2 companies together. So we looked at every element of the balance sheet, as you would expect that. We looked at where net working capital is deployed, whether it's accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory and other working capital. We looked at that. We looked at the best practices in the both company and obviously, trying to gravitate towards the best practice.
And we're looking at the industry as well. So we came up with a program that we are kind of implementing it right now. We also did is we looked at the operational metrics and had each of the asset owner start driving those that we can see the benefit on that. The bottom line of this is, this is a very sustainable program at the grassroot levels in the organization. Not only I see, Navann, the benefit this year, but I see the benefit getting into next year and year after that.
And as the onetime costs come down, which we're expecting that to come down next year and year after that, I see cash flow -- free cash flow to improve next year and the year after that.

So on the -- all the items that I talked about in my prepared remarks had a commentary on that. Specifically for the EBITDA, that -- the question that you asked, if we look at the kind of the step-down in the revenue, which is all due to the expected events that I explained that there is a flow-through of the EBITDA going down, there is a gross margin pressure. I talked about that because of the evolving product mix, and then you have some onetime events on the COGS line.
The other thing that's also happening in Q4, which is obviously impacting the EBITDA level is the step-up in the SG&A line. As we are seeing the world recovering from COVID, there is going to be a step-up in the SG&A expenses, which actually helps us position well not only this year but sets up well for the next year.

Can you give us some color as to how you're thinking about your base U.S. generics business and just your overall U.S. small molecule retail presence over time, particularly the more commodity end of the business? Can you just talk to how you're thinking about that philosophically?"

So David, yes, U.S. has been one of our core business and we have lived through the various cycles over the years. And for me, the cycles continue, and there's nothing new. For the last few years, we knew how this business is evolving. There was a commodity bucket, and there was still a bucket of hard-to-make and complex products.
From a science perspective, we continued to invest for several years to going up the value chain. So that's paying off. And the commodities where we saw that there's a power of the vertical integration, we still retain those. Where we see a huge competition and the commodity means actually turning out a commodity with a [ 15-term ] market, we took the opportunity to prune that portfolio. And if we now pull together, we have a well-diversified generics portfolio, which is being -- which is performing very well and as we expected.
We have strong customer service levels. Given what we are doing with the rationalization of facility or in the COVID, we have not missed a beat. We have very strong service levels. So that puts us in a great position to manage the challenges as well as grab opportunities. So we couldn't -- I think we feel good how we are all excited about this business. And if we normalize the onetime events like Tecfidera's LOE or loss of the exclusivity of Wixela and XULANE lane, we are right at where we forecasted, mid-single-digit price erosion. So thanks for your question."
