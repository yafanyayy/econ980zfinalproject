Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year. We came into 2020 with g",1805,"Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year. 
We came into 2020 with great momentum, and this continued into the first quarter, delivering 5.6% organic growth. Then COVID-19 hit the U.S. economy and things changed dramatically. 
While there was significant uncertainty, we knew we had a great team that is resilient, responsive and innovative, with a focus on providing solutions to our customers. In addition, we were able to move -- we were able to quickly transition over 10,000 teammates to a remote working environment in less than a week so they could pivot and effectively serve our customers. As you may remember, we didn't grow as quickly in the second quarter due to the impact of the pandemic on our new business and the recording of revenue adjustments for general liability policies while we still expanded our margins. Then in the third quarter, we delivered outstanding results with strong organic growth and margin expansion. The results of the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as we finished the year strong and with good momentum going into '21. 
Based on what we were seeing, if you'd asked me if it was likely that we would deliver full year results with good organic growth and meaningful margin expansion, I would have said it was possible, but unlikely that if you would ask me that in, let's say, April. 
We are very pleased with our results for 2020. We are able to deliver these results through the hard work of our teammates and their dedication to our customers.  2020 was a testament to our laser focus on delivering innovative risk solutions. We also thought the M&A landscape would cool off for several quarters until there was some sort of economic stability. The slowdown only occurred for about 1 quarter, and the industry-wide activity has now rebounded to pre COVID-19 levels. Even with the uncertainty this year, we're very pleased to have completed 25 acquisitions and $197 million of acquired annual revenue. 
I'd like to highlight 2 strategic acquisitions, [indiscernible] that we completed in the fourth quarter and Aleri Insurances that we announced in the fourth quarter and closed on the 14th of January. Regarding Cover Ham, this acquisition will help us in many ways. First, it will help us further our investment in technology, drive our innovation agenda and improve our carrier connectivity. Second, it enables us to more effectively and efficiently provide quotes and bond coverage for our National Programs segment. 
Third, it enables us to better serve smaller customers within our Retail segment. Ultimately, these items are focused on enhancing the customer buying experience by delivering curated quotes that best meet the needs of our customers. We believe these new capabilities are unique in the marketplace. 
We started 2020 with the acquisition of Special Risk in British Columbia and finished the year with our acquisition of Alere Insurances in Ireland. Aleri was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace. This acquisition strengthens our European operations, which we look forward to further developing in the years ahead. Our new teammates and capabilities will deliver many opportunities over the coming years. 
We're extremely proud of our results in 2020 and the delivery of total shareholder returns in excess of 20%. And I'd like to thank all of our teammates for everything they did to make it a great year. 
As you've seen in the press release, Tony Strianese is taking on the role of Chairman of our wholesale segment, and Steve Boyd will become our President of Wholesale. Steve's background in National Programs as an operator and in technology brings critical skills to the leadership team and wholesale as we continue to grow this important business through innovative solutions. I'm excited that Tony and Steve will be working together to further drive this growth in the future. 
Now let's transition to the results of the quarter and the full year. I'm on Slide #3. We delivered strong results, again, this quarter. Total revenue was $642 million, growing 10.9% in total and 4.7% organically. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. 
Our EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, which is up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Please remember that the fourth quarter of '19 included a gain on sale of business that benefited the prior year margin by approximately 100 basis points. Our net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, increasing 25.9% on an as-reported basis. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year. Our team did an outstanding job of continuing to profitably grow our revenue as well as manage our expenses in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19. During the quarter, we completed another 9 acquisitions, with annual revenues of approximately $80 million. We'd like to spend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. 
For the year, we grew total revenues of 9.2% and delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%. This was an outstanding performance given the economic headwinds experienced for most of the year. We improved our EBITDAC margin by 110 basis points to 31.1% compared to 2019 as we leverage the growth in organic revenue and managed our expenses in response to the pandemic. Our net income per share for the full year of '20 increased 20.7% to $1.69 and from $1.4 in 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-outs, net income per share increased 19.3%. 
Lastly, we had another strong year of M&A activity, as I said earlier, closing 25 acquisitions with approximately $197 million of annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and teammates. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
Now on Slide 5. In prior calls, we talked about factors that would impact the economic recovery, which included the elections. The approval of the vaccine and the timing of the rollout as well as how much additional stimulus would be approved. The timing of the vaccine rollout and the approval of additional stimulus will have the largest impact upon the recovery the economy and will influence business leaders' confidence about rehiring and investing in their businesses. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to see companies doing well and others struggling mightily. We've seen improving new business, and our retention remains good. However, we continue to believe it will be choppy -- a choppy recovery through at least the end of '21 and and maybe into early '22. From a rate standpoint, the fourth quarter was very similar to the third quarter. Most standard rates were up 3% to 7%, with ENS rates up 10% to 25% as compared to the prior year. As we've talked about before, the main driver of rate increases continues to be loss experience. Commercial auto rates remain up 10% or more and workers' compensation rates are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters, but they're still negative. There has been a lot of talk over the past few quarters that workers' compensation rates are turning positive. However, we're still not seeing this across the board yet. 
From an E&S perspective, coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%. And depending on the coverage and the industry. We continue to see outliers for these lines of coverage. Personal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast states remain under intense pressure as carriers are seeking to reduce their exposure due to fires, tropical activity during 2020. We expect the reduction in personal lines capacity continue throughout '21. 
Placing coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with significant losses continues to be challenging. This includes excess or umbrella coverage, where a carrier or carriers will seek a combination of lower limit and higher premium rates. We don't expect this trend to materially change in '21. 
Now on Slide #6. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Our Retail segment's organic revenue growth grew by 1.5% for the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we had about 100 basis points of timing items that benefited the growth in the third quarter and negatively impacted the growth in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by new business, better customer retention and premium rate increases, but was impacted by lower exposure units resulting from the pandemic. We view the performance for the fourth quarter has been good, considering we delivered 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year and taking into consideration the timing headwinds mentioned earlier. 
Organic revenue growth for the full year was 2.4%, which we consider a good performance in light of a tough economic environment. Our National Programs segment grew 14.1% organically, delivering another stellar quarter. Our growth was driven by strong new business, retention and rate increases. Some of the top-performing programs were our lender place, commercial and residential [indiscernible], rent and personal property, just to name a few. 
For the full year, our National Programs segment grew organically an impressive 12.3%, a huge thanks to Chris Walker and all of the team in National Programs for delivering a great quarter and a great year. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.8% organically for the quarter. We realized strong new business and continued rate increases from most lines of coverage. Brokerage was the fastest-growing, again, this quarter, while we continue to experience headwinds and in our binding and quality and personalized businesses due to the economy and carrier appetite we mentioned previously. 
For the full year, our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.5% organically, delivering another good year. The organic revenue for our Services segment decreased 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, representing good improvement from the last few quarters. The main drivers depressing growth continue to be lower claims volume for our social security and Medicare set aside advocacy businesses. The decline was substantially offset by revenue generated by processing claims for weather-related events that occurred in the third and fourth quarters. 
For the full year, organic revenue decreased by 10.9%, driven by lower claims for our social security advocacy business, certain terminated customer contracts and the impact of the pandemic. While not back in positive territory, we believe the fourth quarter was a turning point, and we anticipate delivering modest organic growth for 2021. 
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
297244,699939765,2181395,"Brown & Brown, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","Brown & Brown, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Move on to Slide #7. Like previous quarters, we're going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition",1298,"Great. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Move on to Slide #7. Like previous quarters, we're going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables. 
For the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of 61 -- $63.1 million or 10.9%, and organic revenue growth of 4.7%. Our EBITDAC increased by 11.3%, growing slightly faster than revenues as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our expenses in response to COVID-19. These both offset the headwinds associated with the gain on disposal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased noncash stock-based compensation. 
Our income before income taxes increased by 28.3%, outpacing EBITDAC growth. This was primarily driven by the $15 million year-over-year decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
On the next slide, we'll discuss our results excluding this adjustment. Our net income increased by $20.8 million or 27.2%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 25.9% to $0.34. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7%, substantially in line with the 25% we realized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to [ $0.093  or ] 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter 2019. 
Over on Slide #8. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more comparable year-on-year basis. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the changing estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $9.5 million as compared to a $5.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2019. The credit was primarily driven by the reduction in estimated earn-out payables for an acquisition within the National Programs segment. Excluding the change in acquisition earn-outs in the fourth quarter of both years, our income before income tax grew $13.9 million or 12.9%. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $9.7 million or 12%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3%. Overall, it was a great quarter. 
We'll move over to Slide #9. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 10.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs were slightly down for the quarter. Our organic revenues, which will exclude the net impact of M&A activity, increased by 4.7% for the fourth quarter. 
Over to Slide #10. Our retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 7.2% driven by acquisition activity and organic revenue growth of 1.5%. The timing discussed above negatively impacted our organic revenue by 100 basis points for the quarter. EBITDAC grew 5.3% due to leveraging organic revenue and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic. This growth was slower than the growth in total revenues, primarily due to a prior year gain on disposal that represented a negative year-over-year impact of approximately 150 basis points. Our income for income tax margin increased 130 basis points and grew faster than EBITDAC, due primarily to the change in estimated acquisition earn-outs. 
We move on to Slide #11. Our National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.3 million or 18.9%, and organic revenue by 14.1%. The increase in total revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth across many programs. EBITDAC growth of 19% was in line with total revenue growth. The leveraging of strong organic revenue and the management of variable cost was offset by higher intercompany IT charges and lower contingent commissions. 
Income before income taxes increased by $20.3 million or 54%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to decreased acquisition earnout payables that was partially offset by higher intercompany interest expense. 
Over to Slide #12. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 19.2% and organic revenue growth of 5.8%. Total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions with contingent commissions substantially flat year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 17.1%, with a margin decline of 40 basis points as compared to the prior year. While we delivered good organic growth and reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19, these were more than offset due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, higher intercompany interest charges. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was lower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense. 
Over to Slide #13. Total revenues and organic revenues for the Services segment both declined by about 50 basis points, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier. For the quarter, EBITDAC increased by 9.7% and due to increased weather-related claims and was partially offset by higher intercompany IT expenses. Income before income taxes decreased 23.6% due to a credit of $2.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that did not reoccur -- or occur in 2020. 
Over to Slide #14. This slide presents our GAAP results for the full year of 2020 and 2019. For 2020, we delivered revenues of $2.6 billion, growing 9.2%; and earnings per share of $1.69, growing 20.7%. Our EBITDAC increased by 13.5%, and our EBITDAC margin grew by 110 basis points. For the year, our share count increased slightly as compared to the prior year, and our dividends paid during 2020 as compared to 2019 increased by 7.1%. 
Over to Slide #15, and this slide presents our results, excluding the change in estimated acquisition and earn-out payables for both years. For the full year of 2020, on an adjusted basis, our income before income taxes grew 18.1%, which outpaced EBITDAC growth due to lower interest expense, and our adjusted net income per share grew by 19.3%. In addition to strong income performance metrics, we also had another strong year for cash conversion due to the strength of our operating model and diversity of our businesses. We delivered $721.6 million of cash flow from operations, representing a continued strong conversion rate of 27.6% as a percentage of revenue. We also finished the year in a strong liquidity position, with $817 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $800 million of accessible capital on our revolver. With this capital and the cash we will generate in 2021, we are in a good position to fund continued investment in our company. 
We've got a few other comments regarding outlook for 2021. During the third quarter, we were asked the question about our potential margins for 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 savings we had in 2020. Now with the year completed and a bit more visibility in 2021, we expect EBITDAC margins could be flat to up slightly considering our variable cost will more than likely increase as we're able to travel and see customers face-to-face. As we've done in the past, our leaders will be focused on growing profitably. 
Regarding contingency, we are anticipating them to be relatively flat or maybe down slightly in 2021. As it pertains to taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for 2021 and to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This does not take into consideration any potential changes in the federal tax rates that are being discussed by the new administration. 
For interest expense, we're anticipating a $7 and $9 million increase as compared to 2020, driven by the new bonds we issued in September of 2020. 
From a capital perspective, we are expecting our CapEx to decrease in 2021 to approximately $40 million to $45 million as we have substantially completed the development of our new Beach campus. With that, let me turn it back over to Paul for closing comments."

In my opening comments, I mentioned there are still a few items that need to be resolved over the coming quarters. We will watch closely the successful rollout of the vaccine and additional stimulus to help those in need. Both of these items will influence the pace of economic recovery over the coming quarters. From a rate perspective, we expect increases for the first 6 months of '21 to be similar to those seen in '20. Ultimately, the rate of increases will be driven by losses sustained in 2020 from the record-setting number of tropical storms and the millions of acres that were burned. The question remains for how much longer and at what pace do rates need to achieve their targeted returns? We think the market is getting near an inflection point over the coming year for certain lines that will drive some rate moderation. 
The acquisition pace seems to be as active as ever and competition between private equity and long-term strategics remains. We continue to believe the aggressive pricing for deals like PE will not abate anytime soon. However, we're well positioned with our low leverage and the capital on our balance sheet as well as access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity. 
Our pipeline remains good, and we will keep our disciplined approach to M&A as it's proven to be very successful, but as you know, we don't count anything until it's closed. 
Finally, technology and innovation continue to be at the forefront regarding creation of new products and enhancing the experience of our customers. We will continue to digitize our data, automate and prioritize technology investments around the following: optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics program, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services, and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes. 
As we deliver on these goals, we will see new opportunities for growth that will serve our customers even better. We had a great 2020 on many fronts and have good momentum heading into '21. I am extremely proud of how our team has served our customers through extremely challenging times. We have a great team and a highly diversified business, those that have performed very well in the past, and we expect they will in the future. Ultimately, our financial performance is only possible through the combined efforts of our nearly 11,000 teammates and our commitment to serve our customers.

So we're very pleased that the team in Ireland has joined, and I would tell you that Alere Insurances is very similar to our organization maybe 20 years ago. It reminds me greatly of us, and how they are involved in their communities and they serve their customers and their relationships with their carriers. So as a general statement, and this is a very general statement, we, #1, obviously, like the Irish marketplace; two, we like the fact that some places like Ireland or England or Canada has a rule of law. And so you think about that and we think about places where people have built and grow good businesses and we will continue to look in those areas. 
Now please don't take that comment out of context, Elyuse, that says we're now on international spending binge. That is not the case. We evaluate every transaction in a very similar way, and it starts with a cultural fit and does it make sense financially? And if those 2 things, if there's a cultural fit, we usually think there's a way to make something work. And so vetting those and getting the right ones and doing all that, it's just like doing it here in the United States, it's just 7,000 miles away or further. And so we will continue to look at businesses in areas like that. We have looked over the years. And for whatever reason, we haven't -- we bought the business at the beginning of the year in Vancouver, Canada. We've looked at businesses in Canada before. And for whatever reason, it just didn't work in the past, and they were good firms, it just didn't work out. And so I think that it's another opportunity for us, but I do not want anybody on this call to think that this is some new flavor of the month or something. It's absolutely not that. And we will continue to look for firms that fit our criteria and continue to tell the Brown & Brown story because we're a forever company, and that's appealing to some people. 
And so we're really excited about it."

Here's the thing that, Phil, you can't fully put your finger on. And so there are businesses that have -- as an example, they have furloughed people. But by furloughing people, they're still on their employee benefit plan as an example. And now, let's say, that company has brought back half of the people that were furloughed, but they terminated the other half. All of a sudden, you actually have a reduction in exposure units in that example. And so it is not as though we have clear line of sight on what every customer is going to do in that regard. 
So remember, I think of new business as new, new business, a new customer to us and a new line, a new -- just a new customer to us is new business. But you can have an existing customer where you write the P&C and then pick up the benefits, or write the benefits then pick up the P&C. And I don't consider that a new customer, it's a new line. But I think the important thing is, remember, we have always talked about our business is a reflection of the middle and upper middle market economy. And so if you think about all the customers that we touch and have the good fortune to work with and earn their business every day, some of those customers are looking at their business differently today than they have in the past. That could be positive or negative. They could be adding 15 people or they could be releasing 50. So the reason we say the choppy part is, there's all kinds of variables outstanding. First question, are people going to mandate that their employees get vaccines and come back to work? Well, based on the studies that I've seen so far, about 75% of the companies out there that I'm aware of have said no to that, okay? 
So how does that impact work going forward? What about people that have been hanging on by their fingernails, and then, all of a sudden, they say, we're just going to be done, we're going to hang it up. And I don't -- we don't see something, Phil, that indicates that. But I can tell you, we are paid to think in advance around the corner, and we're trying to anticipate what could happen in the next 3 or 4 quarters."

And that could be anything from kicking off a new capital project for a building, acquiring another organization, making some sort of an expansion whatever the case maybe, depending upon that level of confidence, they may decide just to delay that by 90 days. And that's just not uncommon, and we saw some of that. From the second quarter into the third quarter and the fourth quarter, where things just move around back and forth. And that's really why we say it won't surprise us if there's choppiness because we just don't think that there is a consistent level of confidence yet in the marketplace. And we just think that's going to take some time to work out during '21."

That is not the case today, but I'm saying that could be a -- that would be a different kind of my term governor for organic growth for GEM going forward in a wind program or a quake program or a something type of program. And so I'd say that because remember, we're underwriting on behalf of the carrier. We've been delegating the underwriting authority, but there's 1 carrier or, in some instances, multiple carriers. But in the case of retail, you have -- we have access to the entire marketplace. So virtually every carrier we have access to, so if 1 carrier, Carrier A, doesn't want to do it, Carrier B and C still may consider it. 
So we are very pleased with the growth of National Programs. We do think that there were and continue to be some interesting dynamics in terms of significant rate increases on CAT-exposed business that would drive some of that growth. And one of the things that we've said, Mike, is -- and we haven't seen it yet, but we've talked to these people and some of these people that there are other providers of capital that are either coming into the marketplace or are in the marketplace that, if, in fact, everything else stayed constant which probably won't be the case, but if they did in their new capacity, that's either going to moderate the rate increases, or, in some instances, it might even reduce the rates just slightly. 
So I'm just thinking about, if you have a condo in Miami and the thing's gone up 15%, let's just make this up, or more for the last 3 years, and then all of a sudden, somebody comes in and they give a flat renewal, to get it, or even slightly down, maybe, you could see that. So you have this very unique time. We think it's -- obviously, it presents a lot of opportunities and challenges all wrap up in one. But I would just tell you that the growth that National Programs has enjoyed and delivered, in our opinion, is #1, spectacular; but two, we don't give growth guidance, as you know, but I would say that the performance was even higher than we anticipated for 2020. So I say that just to kind of give you a sense of it because it's a great business and the market will turn 1 day and that growth rate will slow down some and things like that. But yes."

And what I would say is this, we are going to make the right investments in the business, and we raised the issue of technology. So we're going to use that specifically as we see fit going forward now and in the future. I don't want to give you the impression that, ""Okay, if we're growing more, then we're going to invest more, or if we're growing less, we're going to invest less."" That isn't really the way we think about it. The way we think about it is, where do we want to go, how do we want to get there? And then what do we need to do, buy, build, partner to get there. And then along the journey, we're going to reassess and say, was our original hypothesis correct, is it validated, or are -- do we need to course correct midstream? And so, once again, I would tell you this. I think that -- and this is a hard one because I know what you, as an analyst, are trying to do in terms of margin movement and things like this. And we've been very consistent in saying where we thought the margin would be, where the organic growth would be in steady state economies and even in kind of variable economies, which is what we're in today. But again, and I said this, and I think it's important for everybody just to pause and think about it. If you had asked, Andy and myself in April, if we would have delivered 3.8% organic growth and 110 basis points of improved margin, Andy and I, if we could have said it publicly, we would have said, it's possible, but the probability is very small based on what we were seeing then. So I would take you back to how you thought in April. And so it's not about just how we thought, it's how you thought. 
And some people thought the world was coming to an end. And so what I would tell you is, we are -- couldn't be more proud of the way our team responded because it isn't easy, as you know. And so the thing that this -- all this doesn't reflect. If the numbers are a result of almost 11,000 teammates busting their butts for their customers every day, and I know you know that, but I will tell you, there's a lot that goes into it to deliver these numbers. And so I couldn't be happier under the circumstances. And we're going to continue to invest in technology. And I think there are lots of opportunities in some of the things that we're doing already, and there will be some that we haven't yet invested in. Andy?"

So there's no misconception out there so if there's a concern that with us talking about innovation and technology that we're going to make the big investment to take the margins backwards, you can go ahead and leave that concern. In 2016, in the first quarter, we talked about our investment program, when we laid out a very clear path as to what we're going to do with our margins on the way down and on the way up. And I think, hopefully, you've been really, really clear on that. It's also in our investor deck. If we have a situation like that in the future, we will talk to all of our investors and all of our analysts. What we're really saying is we think when you've got appropriate spending side of the business. We will balance between, we'll call it, the BAU stuff and innovation through the organization, but we do believe that innovation is very important in how we can serve and engage with our customers and our carrier partners. We will continue to do that as an organization. Not all of it will be CapEx, not all of it's going to be OpEx, right? There's going to be balances back and forth because sometimes as part of that leasing or partnering that Powell talked about, that's going to flow some things will build ourselves. We can work through all those. And again, we've incorporated that into all the guidance, at least, that we've given for 2021. If other opportunities pop up during '21 that we need to change our view because we think it's something really good for our business long term and delivers appropriate shareholder values, then we will absolutely talk to everybody about it.

If you look at last year, we grew free cash flow significantly faster than EBITDAC as well as the earnings per share. So I think last year, we were at, on a free cash flow, close to about 15%. I think this year, we're not at [ 7. 6% ]. So you will see some movement up and down inside of there. It's the reason why we focus a lot on the cash flow from operations on the conversion ratio, we were just shy of 28% this year. We were just a little over 28% last year. So it's going to kind of hover in that range. But we're really, really pleased with the cash and the way that we were able to convert our revenues, again, in 2020?"

Then we get to the end of the second quarter, and the outlook looks completely different. And then by the third quarter, it looks different, again. We took them all back up. And so you are going to see unusual swings on a full year. Actually, we didn't really have a lot of movement. You can see around. And that's part of this be unknown about this economy because what we have to be able to do is incorporate the best information that we have at the time of doing the calculations as to what we think is going to occur over the remaining earn-out period. And that's what we tried to do this year. I would say if you go back and look over time, our actual adjustments on a full year basis are actually pretty normal considering the size of the earn-outs that we have as well as the purchase price. So we think, overall, we do a pretty good job. This year is probably a little bit of a different one just because of the economy that we're in right now."

And the reason why is because that means that the business is performing well.

So, Greg, if we go back to our earlier comments, the $700 million issuance, or [ 15-year ] bonds in September, that was the -- that was the primary driver of the cash drilling up. And as we talked about during the previous call, the reason why we access the market back at that point is we thought it was a very, very opportune time to go get very low-cost of capital as an organization. And as you know well, when you need -- it is expensive when you don't, it generally isn't. And we thought we were just in a great position as an organization. The markets were extremely, extremely receptive for us to issue bonds at just a little over 2.5% -- 2.25%. So we're very, very pleased with that. That doesn't mean that we issued that because we've got big pending acquisitions or we're going to do a big buyback as an organization, not at all. 
It's there. We talked about the fact that definitely worth that potential slide maybe of carry to have the access to that capital, the [indiscernible]. So that's just a thought on that front. The other piece on the cash and cash equivalents is, keep in mind that not all of that is Brown & Brown cash.

Here's the way I describe it. If you have a larger customer, as an example, and you typically had 3 people that went to see that customer. And they go to see that customer twice a year, and then there's interaction throughout the year. The scenario that I'd say is, due to 3 people go back in '21, or does 1 person go back and 2 or 3 or even 4 people join in via video conference so we leverage the collective capabilities of everybody. I tend to think towards the latter instead of the former, but that is not my decision, it's, ultimately, the customer's decision. That's #1. #2, I think that buying on the Internet, so that's what I call it, where you see them on the video screen and all that other stuff, that might work for like 1 year, but particularly in a rising rate environment, customers need to see you, because people buy from people they like and they trust. 
And at the end of the day, you don't get the full impact on a video screen, that's #2. Now interestingly enough, that would lead me into the third point, which is more about acquisitions. And so I want to make sure that everybody on the call knows that we meet with people to determine if their culture and our cultures fit. So we're not buying businesses on the Internet. That means we are not buying businesses from people that we have never met except over a video conference. So I think all this video conferencing stuff is great, but I'm tired of some of it because I think it's -- you miss so much. 
So having said that, as it relates to the expenses, remember, I know what you're trying to do and some of the other larger public brokers are talking about amounts that they're going to save and permanently save and capture. I don't know what they were doing before, but we already know that we were efficient before. I think that we're focused on how do we retain the business that we have and, quite honestly, write a bunch of new business. So that may mean that we do some things a little differently in terms of solicitation or prospecting or prequalifying using technology, which, in turn, makes us a little more efficient in closing. That's yet to be determined, but I don't want to give you the impression that the margins are going to go dramatically one way or the other because 1 of our customers only need to see 1 of us twice a year as opposed to 3 of us. I think it's too early to tell. I would just say this, our teammates are anxious to be able to go back and see their customers. They want to see them, and customers want to see us.

I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year. We came into 2020 with g",1801,"Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year. 
We came into 2020 with great momentum, and this continued into the first quarter, delivering 5.6% organic growth. Then COVID-19 hit the U.S. economy and things changed dramatically. While there was significant uncertainty, we knew we had a great team that is resilient, responsive and innovative, with a focus on providing solutions to our customers. In addition, we were able to move -- we were able to quickly transition over 10,000 teammates to a remote working environment in less than a week so they could pivot and effectively serve our customers. 
As you may remember, we didn't grow as quickly in the second quarter due to the impact of the pandemic on our new business and the recording of revenue adjustments for general liability policies while we still expanded our margins. Then in the third quarter, we delivered outstanding results with strong organic growth and margin expansion. The results of the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as we finished the year strong and with good momentum going into '21. 
Based on what we were seeing, if you'd asked me if it was likely that we would deliver full year results with good organic growth and meaningful margin expansion, I would have said it was possible, but unlikely that if you would ask me that in, let's say, April. 
We are very pleased with our results for 2020. We are able to deliver these results through the hard work of our teammates and their dedication to our customers.  2020 was a testament to our laser focus on delivering innovative risk solutions. We also thought the M&A landscape would cool off for several quarters until there was some sort of economic stability. The slowdown only occurred for about 1 quarter, and the industry-wide activity has now rebounded to pre COVID-19 levels. Even with the uncertainty this year, we're very pleased to have completed 25 acquisitions and $197 million of acquired annual revenue. 
I'd like to highlight 2 strategic acquisitions, CoverHound that we completed in the fourth quarter and O’Leary Insurances that we announced in the fourth quarter and closed on the 14th of January. Regarding CoverHound, this acquisition will help us in many ways. First, it will help us further our investment in technology, drive our innovation agenda and improve our carrier connectivity. Second, it enables us to more effectively and efficiently provide quotes and bond coverage for our National Programs segment. 
Third, it enables us to better serve smaller customers within our Retail segment. Ultimately, these items are focused on enhancing the customer buying experience by delivering curated quotes that best meet the needs of our customers. We believe these new capabilities are unique in the marketplace. 
We started 2020 with the acquisition of Special Risk in British Columbia and finished the year with our acquisition of O’Leary Insurances in Ireland. O’Leary was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace. This acquisition strengthens our European operations, which we look forward to further developing in the years ahead. Our new teammates and capabilities will deliver many opportunities over the coming years. 
We're extremely proud of our results in 2020 and the delivery of total shareholder returns in excess of 20%. And I'd like to thank all of our teammates for everything they did to make it a great year. 
As you've seen in the press release, Tony Strianese is taking on the role of Chairman of our wholesale segment, and Steve Boyd will become our President of Wholesale. Steve's background in National Programs as an operator and in technology brings critical skills to the leadership team and wholesale as we continue to grow this important business through innovative solutions. I'm excited that Tony and Steve will be working together to further drive this growth in the future. 
Now let's transition to the results of the quarter and the full year. I'm on Slide #3. We delivered strong results, again, this quarter. Total revenue was $642 million, growing 10.9% in total and 4.7% organically. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. 
Our EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, which is up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Please remember that the fourth quarter of '19 included a gain on sale of business that benefited the prior year margin by approximately 100 basis points. Our net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, increasing 25.9% on an as-reported basis. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year. Our team did an outstanding job of continuing to profitably grow our revenue as well as manage our expenses in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19. During the quarter, we completed another 9 acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $80 million. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. 
For the year, we grew total revenues of 9.2% and delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%. This was an outstanding performance given the economic headwinds experienced for most of the year. We improved our EBITDAC margin by 110 basis points to 31.1% compared to 2019 as we leverage the growth in organic revenue and managed our expenses in response to the pandemic. Our net income per share for the full year of '20 increased 20.7% to $1.69 from $1.40 in 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-outs, net income per share increased 19.3%. 
Lastly, we had another strong year of M&A activity, as I said earlier, closing 25 acquisitions with approximately $197 million of annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and teammates. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
I'm now on Slide 5. In prior calls, we talked about factors that would impact the economic recovery, which included the elections, the approval of the vaccine and the timing of the rollout as well as how much additional stimulus would be approved. The timing of the vaccine rollout and the approval of additional stimulus will have the largest impact upon the recovery of the economy and will influence business leaders' confidence about rehiring and investing in their businesses.
During the fourth quarter, we continue to see companies doing well and others struggling mightily. We've seen improving new business, and our retention remains good. However, we continue to believe it will be choppy -- a choppy recovery through at least the end of '21 and maybe into early '22. From a rate standpoint, the fourth quarter was very similar to the third quarter. Most standard rates were up 3% to 7% with E&S rates up 10% to 25% as compared to the prior year. As we've talked about before, the main driver of rate increases continues to be loss experience. Commercial auto rates remain up 10% or more and workers' compensation rates are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters, but they're still negative. There has been a lot of talk over the past few quarters that workers' compensation rates are turning positive. However, we're still not seeing this across the board yet. 
From an E&S perspective, coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25% depending on the coverage and the industry. We continue to see outliers for these lines of coverage. Personal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast states remain under intense pressure as carriers are seeking to reduce their exposure due to fires, tropical activity during 2020. We expect the reduction in personal lines capacity continue throughout '21.  
Placing coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with significant losses continues to be challenging. This includes excess or umbrella coverage, where a carrier or carriers will seek a combination of lower limit and higher premium rates. We don't expect this trend to materially change in '21.
Now on Slide #6. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Our Retail segment's organic revenue growth grew by 1.5% for the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we had about 100 basis points of timing items that benefited the growth in the third quarter and negatively impacted the growth in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter performance was driven by new business, better customer retention and premium rate increases, but was impacted by lower exposure units resulting from the pandemic. We view the performance for the fourth quarter been good, considering we delivered 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year and taking into consideration the timing headwinds mentioned earlier.
Organic revenue growth for the full year was 2.4%, which we consider a good performance in light of a tough economic environment. Our National Programs segment grew 14.1% organically, delivering another stellar quarter. Our growth was driven by strong new business, retention and rate increases, Some of the top-performing programs were our lender place, commercial and residential earthquake, wind and personal property, just to name a few. 
For the full year, our National Programs segment grew organically an impressive 12.3%, a huge thanks to Chris Walker and all of the team in National Programs for delivering a great quarter and a great year. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.8% organically for the quarter. We realized strong new business and continued rate increases from most lines of coverage. Brokerage was the fastest-growing, again, this quarter, while we continue to experience headwinds in our Binding Authority and personal line businesses due to the economy and carrier appetite we mentioned previously.
For the full year, our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.5% organically, delivering another good year. The organic revenue for our Services segment decreased 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, representing good improvement from the last few quarters. The main drivers depressing growth continue to be lower claims volume for our social security and Medicare Set Aside advocacy businesses. The decline was substantially offset by revenue generated by processing claims for weather-related events that occurred in the third and fourth quarters.
For the full year, organic revenue decreased by 10.9%, driven by lower claims for our social security advocacy business, certain terminated customer contracts and the impact of the pandemic. While not back in positive territory, we believe the fourth quarter was a turning point, and we anticipate delivering modest organic growth for 2021.
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

Move on to Slide #7. Like previous quarters, we're going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisitio",1294,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everyone. Move on to Slide #7. Like previous quarters, we're going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables.  
For the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of 61 -- $63.1 million or 10.9%, and organic revenue growth of 4.7%. Our EBITDAC increased by 11.3%, growing slightly faster than revenues as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our expenses in response to COVID-19. These both offset the headwinds associated with the gain on disposal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased noncash stock-based compensation.  
Our income before income taxes increased by 28.3%, outpacing EBITDAC growth. This was primarily driven by the $15 million year-over-year decrease in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.  
On the next slide, we'll discuss our results excluding this adjustment. Our net income increased by $20.8 million or 27.2%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 25.9% to $0.34. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7%, substantially in line with the 25% we realized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to $0.093or 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter 2019. 
Over on Slide #8. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more comparable year-on-year basis. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the changing estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $9.5 million as compared to a $5.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2019. The credit was primarily driven by the reduction in estimated earn-out payables for an acquisition within the National Programs segment. Excluding the change in acquisition earn-outs in the fourth quarter of both years, our income before income tax grew $13.9 million or 12.9%. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $9.7 million or 12%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3%. Overall, it was a great quarter.  
We move over to Slide #9. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 10.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs were slightly down for the quarter. Our organic revenues, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity, increased by 4.7% for the fourth quarter.  
Over to Slide #10. Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 7.2% driven by acquisition activity and organic revenue growth of 1.5%. The timing discussed above negatively impacted our organic revenue by 100 basis points for the quarter. EBITDAC grew 5.3% due to leveraging organic revenue and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic. This growth was slower than the growth in total revenues, primarily due to a prior year gain on disposal that represented a negative year-over-year impact of approximately 150 basis points. Our income for income tax margin increased 130 basis points and grew faster than EBITDAC, due primarily to the change in estimated acquisition earn-outs.  
We move on to Slide #11. Our National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.3 million or 18.9%, and organic revenue by 14.1%. The increase in total revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth across many programs. EBITDAC growth of 19% was in line with total revenue growth. The leveraging of strong organic revenue and the management of variable cost was offset by higher intercompany IT charges and lower contingent commissions.  
Income before income taxes increased by $20.3 million or 54%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to decreased acquisition earn-out payables that was partially offset by higher intercompany interest expense.  
Over to Slide #12. Our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 19.2% and organic revenue growth of 5.8%. Total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions with contingent commissions substantially flat year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 17.1% with a margin decline of 40 basis points as compared to the prior year. While we delivered good organic growth and reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19, these were more than offset due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and to a lesser extent, higher intercompany IT charges. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was lower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense.  
Over to Slide #13. Total revenues and organic revenues for the Services segment, both declined by about 50 basis points, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier. For the quarter, EBITDAC increased by 9.7% due to increased weather-related claims and was partially offset by higher intercompany IT expenses. 
Income before income taxes decreased 23.6% due to a credit of $2.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that did not reoccur -- or occur in 2020.  
Over to Slide #14. This slide presents our GAAP results for the full year of 2020 and 2019. For 2020, we delivered revenues of $2.6 billion, growing 9.2%; and earnings per share of $1.69, growing 20.7%. Our EBITDAC increased by 13.5%, and our EBITDAC margin grew by 110 basis points. For the year, our share count increased slightly as compared to the prior year, and our dividends paid during 2020 as compared to 2019 increased by 7.1%.  
Over to Slide #15. This slide presents our results excluding the change in estimated acquisition and earn-out payables for both years. For the full year of 2020, on an adjusted basis, our income before income taxes grew 18.1%, which outpaced EBITDAC growth due to lower interest expense, and our adjusted net income per share grew by 19.3%. 
In addition to strong income performance metrics, we also had another strong year for cash conversion due to the strength of our operating model and diversity of our businesses. We delivered $721.6 million of cash flow from operations, representing a continued strong conversion rate of 27.6% as a percentage of revenue. We also finished the year in a strong liquidity position, with $817 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as $800 million of accessible capital on our revolver. With this capital and the cash we will generate in 2021, we are in a good position to fund continued investments in our company.  
We've got a few other comments regarding outlook for 2021. During the third quarter, we were asked the question about our potential margins for 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 savings we had in 2020. And now with the year completed and a bit more visibility in 2021, we expect EBITDAC margins could be flat to up slightly considering our variable cost will more than likely increase as we're able to travel and see customers face-to-face. As we've done in the past, our leaders will be focused on growing profitable.  
Regarding contingents, we are anticipating them to be relatively flat or maybe down slightly in 2021. As it pertains to taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for 2021 to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This does not take into consideration any potential changes in the federal tax rates that are being discussed by the new administration.  
For interest expense, we're anticipating a $7 million and $9 million increase as compared to 2020, driven by the new bonds we issued in September of 2020.  
From a capital perspective, we are expecting our CapEx to decrease in 2021 to approximately $40 million to $45 million as we have substantially completed the development of our new Daytona Beach campus. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

In my opening comments, I mentioned there are still a few items that need to be resolved over the coming quarters. We will watch closely the successful rollout of the vaccine and additional stimulus to help those in need. Both of these items will influence the pace of economic recovery over the coming quarters. From a rate perspective, we expect increases for the first 6 months of '21 to be similar to those seen in '20. Ultimately, the rate of increases will be driven by losses sustained in 2020 from the record-setting number of tropical storms and the millions of acres that were burned. The question remains for how much longer and at what pace do rates need to achieve their targeted returns? We think the market is getting near an inflection point over the coming year for certain lines that will drive some rate moderation.  
The acquisition pace seems to be as active as ever and competition between private equity and long-term strategics remains. We continue to believe the aggressive pricing for deals like PE will not abate anytime soon. However, we're well positioned with our low leverage and the capital on our balance sheet as well as access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity.  
Our pipeline remains good, and we will keep our disciplined approach to M&A as it's proven to be very successful. But as you know, we don't count anything until it's closed.  
Finally, technology and innovation continue to be at the forefront regarding creation of new products and enhancing the experience of our customers. We will continue to digitize our data, automate and prioritize technology investments around the following: optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics program, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services, and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.  
As we deliver on these goals, we will see new opportunities for growth that will serve our customers even better. We had a great 2020 on many fronts and have good momentum heading into '21. I am extremely proud of how our team has served our customers through extremely challenging times. We have a great team and a highly diversified business. And both have performed very well in the past, and we expect they will in the future. Ultimately, our financial performance is only possible through the combined efforts of our nearly 11,000 teammates and our commitment to serve our customers.

And we -- the -- I think the results this year are a testament to how our system works, which is, at every office, the leader that runs those offices, she or he is responsible for that P&L. And by doing so, they control expenses that were controllable or variable at the office level. And then as those individuals group are able to go back and travel or serve our customers in a different capacity, we will incur those expenses again. And so it's not as though we're going to be able to give you, meaning you, Elyse, or any other analyst, a specific number because that's not the way it works.

So as a general statement, and this is a very general statement, we, #1, obviously, like the Irish marketplace; two, we like the fact that some places like Ireland or England or Canada has a rule of law. And so you think about that and we think about places where people have built and grow good businesses and we will continue to look in those areas.  
Now please don't take that comment out of context, Elyse, that says we're now on international spending binge. That is not the case. We evaluate every transaction in a very similar way, and it starts with a cultural fit and does it make sense financially? And if those 2 things, if there's a cultural fit, we usually think there's a way to make something work. And so vetting those and getting the right ones and doing all that, it's just like doing it here in the United States, it's just 7,000 miles away or further. And so we will continue to look at businesses in areas like that. We have looked over the years. And for whatever reason, we haven't -- we bought the business at the beginning of the year in Vancouver, Canada. We've looked at businesses in Canada before. And for whatever reason, it just didn't work in the past, and they were good firms, it just didn't work out. And so I think that it's another opportunity for us, but I do not want anybody on this call to think that this is some new flavor of the month or something. It's absolutely not that. And we will continue to look for firms that fit our criteria and continue to tell the Brown & Brown story because we're a forever company, and that's appealing to some people.

But you can have an existing customer where you write the P&C and then pick up the benefits, or write the benefits then pick up the P&C. And I don't consider that a new customer, it's a new line. But I think the important thing is, remember, we have always talked about our business is a reflection of the middle and upper middle market economy. And so if you think about all the customers that we touch and have the good fortune to work with and earn their business every day, some of those customers are looking at their business differently today than they have in the past. That could be positive or negative. They could be adding 15 people or they could be releasing 50. So the reason we say the choppy part is, there's all kinds of variables outstanding, First question, are people going to mandate that their employees get vaccines and come back to work? Well, based on I think the studies that I've seen so far, about 75% of the companies out there that I'm aware of have said no to that, okay?  
So how does that impact work going forward? What about people that have been hanging on by their fingernails, and then, all of a sudden, they say, we're just going to be done, we're going to hang it up. And I don't -- we don't see something, Phil, that indicates that. But I can tell you, we are paid to think in advance around the corner, and we're trying to anticipate what could happen in the next 3 or 4 quarters."

Think about through the lens of a business owner and their level of confidence knowing what could happen over the next quarter or 4 quarters and then how they invest in their business. And that could be anything from kicking off a new capital project for a building, acquiring another organization, making some sort of an expansion whatever the case maybe. Well, depending upon that level of confidence, they may decide just to delay that by 90 days. And that's just not uncommon, and we saw some of that. From the second quarter into the third quarter and the fourth quarter, where things just move around back and forth. And that's really why we say it won't surprise us if there's choppiness because we just don't think that there is a consistent level of confidence yet in the marketplace. And we just think that's going to take some time to work out during '21."

That is not the case today, but I'm saying that could be a -- that would be a different kind of, my term, governor for organic growth for them going forward in a wind program or a quake program or a something type of program. And so I'd say that because remember, we're underwriting on behalf of the carrier. We've been delegated the underwriting authority. But there's 1 carrier or, in some instances, multiple carriers. But in the case of Retail, you have -- we have access to the entire marketplace. So virtually every carrier we have access to, so if 1 carrier, carrier A, doesn't want to do it, carrier B and C still may consider it.  
So we are very pleased with the growth of National Programs. We do think that there were and continue to be some interesting dynamics in terms of significant rate increases on CAT-exposed business that would drive some of that growth. And one of the things that we've said, Mike, is -- and we haven't seen it yet, but we've talked to these people and some of these people that there are other providers of capital that are either coming into the marketplace or are in the marketplace that, if, in fact, everything else stayed constant, which probably won't be the case, but if they did in their new capacity, that's either going to moderate the rate increases, or in some instances, it might even reduce the rates just slightly.  
So I'm just thinking about, if you have a condo in Miami and the thing's gone up 15%, let's just make this up, or more for the last 3 years. And then all of a sudden, somebody comes in and they give a flat renewal to get it or even slightly down, maybe, you could see that. So you have this very unique time. We think it's -- obviously, it presents a lot of opportunities and challenges all wrap up into one. But I would just tell you that the growth that National Programs has enjoyed and delivered, in our opinion, is #1, spectacular; but two, we don't give growth guidance, as you know, but I would say that the performance was even higher than we anticipated for 2020. So I say that just to kind of give you a sense of it because it's a great business and the market will turn 1 day and that growth rate will slow down some and things like that. But yes."

We are going to make the right investments in the business, and you raised the issue of technology. So we're going to use that specifically as we see fit going forward now and in the future. I don't want to give you the impression that, Okay, if we're growing more, then we're going to invest more, or if we're growing less, we're going to invest less. That isn't really the way we think about it. The way we think about it is, where do we want to go? How do we want to get there? And then what do we need to do, buy, build, partner to get there? And then along the journey, we're going to reassess and say, was our original hypothesis correct, is it validated, or are -- do we need to course correct midstream? And so, once again, I would tell you this. I think that -- and this is a hard one because I know what you, as an analyst, are trying to do in terms of margin movement and things like this. And we've been very consistent in saying where we thought the margin would be, where the organic growth would be in steady state economies and even in kind of variable economies, which is what we're in today. But again, and I said this, and I think it's important for everybody just to pause and think about it. If you had asked Andy and myself in April, if we would have delivered 3.8% organic growth and 110 basis points of improved margin, Andy and I, if we could have said it publicly, we would have said, it's possible, but the probability is very small based on what we were seeing then. So I would take you back to how you thought in April. And so it's not about just how we thought, it's how you thought. 
And some people thought the world was coming to an end. And so what I would tell you is, we are -- couldn't be more proud of the way our team responded because it isn't easy, as you know. And so the thing that this -- all this doesn't reflect is the numbers are a result of almost 11,000 teammates busting their butts for their customers every day, and I know you know that, but I will tell you, there's a lot that goes into it to deliver these numbers. And so I couldn't be happier under the circumstances. And we're going to continue to invest in technology. And I think there are lots of opportunities in some of the things that we're doing already, and there will be some that we haven't yet invested in. Andy?"

So if there's a concern that with us talking about innovation and technology that we're going to make the big investment to take the margins backwards, you can go ahead and leave that concern. In 2016, in the first quarter, we talked about our investment program when we laid out a very clear path as to what we're going to do with our margins on the way down and on the way up. And I think, hopefully, we've been really, really clear on that. It's also in our investor deck. If we have a situation like that in the future, we will talk to all of our investors and all of our analysts. What we're really saying is we think when you've got appropriate spending side of the business, we will balance between, we'll call it, the BAU stuff and innovation through the organization, but we do believe that innovation is very important in how we can serve and engage with our customers and our carrier partners. We will continue to do that as an organization. Not all of it will be CapEx, not all of it's going to be OpEx, right? There's going to be balances back and forth because sometimes as part of that leasing or partnering that Powell talked about, that's going to flow through OpEx. Some things will build ourselves. We can work through all those. And again, we've incorporated that into all the guidance, at least, that we've given for 2021. If other opportunities pop up during '21 that we need to change our view because we think it's something really good for our business long term and delivers appropriate shareholder values, then we will absolutely talk to everybody about it.

And so what we try to do is establish that initial earn-out to a level that, we believe, is reasonable, again, for everything that we know at the time of doing the transactions. Ultimately, we would love to see all of our sellers and our new teammates completely max out their earn-outs. We would love to see that. 
And the reason why is because that means that the business is performing well. Many of them do, some of them don't get all the way there, but we're very, very pleased with our success rate on our acquisitions, how well they perform versus original expectations and, ultimately, over the years after they've become part of the team."

So I would tell you to that, particularly in certain segments of the personal lines market, there -- it's been tough. And so that's the area that typically would come to the E&S market and then the E&S carriers experience -- it could be in our book or it could be in the overall experience, leads them to potentially pull back in certain areas or the reinsurance costs have gone up or both. So this is not something that is unique to Brown & Brown or Brown & Brown Wholesale. It's kind of unique in the industry across the board."

So at this point in time, is this ASR share repurchase on the table? And then embedded in the balance sheet, I did notice that there was a nice jump up in accounts payable. I assume that flowed through and helped your cash flow. But maybe you can walk us what's going on with those 2 items, and your view on capital management? That's my last question."

So, Greg, if we go back to our earlier comments, the $700 million issuance over 10.5-year bonds in September, that was the -- that was the primary driver of the cash drilling up. And as we talked about during the previous call, the reason why we access the market back at that point is we thought it was a very, very opportune time to go get very low cost of capital as an organization. And as you know well, when you need it expensive, when you don't, it generally isn't. And we thought we were just in a great position as an organization. The markets were extremely, extremely receptive for us to issue bonds at just a little over 2.5 -- 2.25%. So we're very, very pleased with that. That doesn't mean that we issued that because we've got big pending acquisitions and so we're going to do a big buyback as an organization, not at all. 
It's there. We talked about the fact that with that capital, the access what we'll generate, we feel really good about how we can invest in our business. So we may have equipped some negative carry on interest, but we think that's definitely worth that potential slight negative carry to have the access to that capital that's out there. So that's just a thought on that front. The other piece on the cash and cash equivalents is just keep in mind that not all of that is Brown & Brown cash. So historically, it's generally been about a 50-50 split between our money and the fiduciary funds rolling through. That is much more weighted towards Brown & Brown at the end of the year.

And I think that's a really interesting question, and I think it will be dictated significantly by our customers, which is we will see that and how that works in the future. Here's the way I describe it. If you have a larger customer, as an example, and you typically had 3 people that went to see that customer. And they go to see that customer twice a year, and then there's interaction throughout the year. The scenario that I'd say is, due to 3 people go back in '21, or does 1 person go back and 2 or 3 or even 4 people join in via video conference so we leverage the collective capabilities of everybody. I tend to think towards the latter instead of the former, but that's -- it's not my decision, it's, ultimately, the customer's decision. That's #1. #2, I think that buying on the internet, so that's what I call it, where you see them on the video screen and all that other stuff, that might work for like 1 year, but particularly in a rising rate environment, customers need to see you, because people buy from people they like and they trust. 
And at the end of the day, you don't get the full impact on a video screen, that's #2. 
Now interestingly enough, that would lead me into the third point, which is more about acquisitions. And so I want to make sure that everybody on the call knows that we meet with people to determine if their culture and our cultures fit. So we're not buying businesses on the internet. That means we are not buying businesses from people that we have never met except over a video conference. So I think all this video conferencing stuff is great, but I'm tired of some of it because I think it's -- you miss so much. So having said that, as it relates to the expenses, remember, I know what you're trying to do and some of the other larger public brokers are talking about amounts that they're going to save and permanently save and capture. I don't know what they were doing before, but we already know that we were efficient before. I think that we're focused on how do we retain the business that we have and, quite honestly, write a bunch of new business. So that may mean that we do some things a little differently in terms of solicitation or prospecting or prequalifying using technology, which, in turn, makes us a little more efficient in closing. It's yet to be determined, but I don't want to give you the impression that the margins are going to go dramatically one way or the other because 1 of our customers only need to see 1 of us twice a year as opposed to 3 of us. I think it's too early to tell. I would just say this, our teammates are anxious to be able to go back and see their customers. They want to see them, and customers want to see us.

We had an outstanding quarter, probably one of the best in Brown & Brown's 82-year history. The results in the quarter are the outcome of the incredible efforts from our team, not only during the quarter, but over the last several years. Each of our segments had great performance, growing significantly on an organic basis and expanding margins due to more new business, good customer retention and increased premium rates across most lines of coverage. 
These results demonstrate how we are focused on enhancing our capabilities, improving the experience for our customers and delivering creative risk management solutions. From a customer segment standpoint, our large and middle market customers, which represent a significant portion of our revenue recovered much quicker. However, smaller businesses are generally recovering at a slower pace. 
During the quarter, we released our first ESG report and are pleased to provide a view into our values as a company. We believe this report provides a comprehensive assessment of where we are in our evolution, but also lays out how we're thinking about the future. Hopefully, our current and future teammates, customers, carrier partners and investors will find the report demonstrates our commitment to these important topics. 
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. As we -- as I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter and are very pleased with our results. We delivered $815 million of revenue growing 16.7% in total and 9.8% organically. This quarter represented one of the strongest quarters of organic growth since we began reporting this measure in the early 2000s. 
I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin was 35.8%, which is up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the first quarter was $0.70, increasing 29.6% on an as-reported basis and 37.3% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. We're excited that Aleri Insurances, which was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace, has joined the Brown & Brown team. 
We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance as the team continues to fire on all cylinders and its focus on executing every day. 
Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. I'm on Slide #4. The economy continues to recover with the vaccine rollout, and we're seeing improving business confidence. However, not all geographies or industries grew at the same pace. Premium rate increases in Q1 were similar to the last few quarters with some growing faster while others grew slower. 
Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. Commercial auto rates are the exception as they remain up 10% or more. We're still not seeing positive workers' compensation rates, but they're getting closer to flat. Overall, the market is becoming more competitive in sections or area, and we're starting to see carriers willing to bind coverage at the expiring rate for new business, but that same carrier would like to get an increase if it was their renewal. 
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry. 
For these lines of coverage, there are definitely outliers. One area where we continue to see the most challenge right now is the E&S personal lines in Florida, California and the Gulf states due to the continued reduction in carrier appetite caused by fire, weather events and the increases in litigated claims over the past few years. 
We believe the reduction in personal line capacity in cat areas will continue to decrease through at least 2021. The placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with losses continues to be challenging. We do not expect this trend to change for this year. 
We also believe that rate increases experienced in the first quarter will more than likely continue for most of 2021, but there may be some moderation in the second half of this year. We closed 2 transactions during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. As we've said in the past, our acquisition activity can vary by quarter as we're focused on ensuring a good cultural fit that makes sense financially. 
This disciplined approach has worked well for us over many years to deliver value from the companies that joined the Brown & Brown team. I'm now on Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered a record organic growth of 9.8% for the first quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of improving new business, good retention and continued rate increases. 
These results were only possible through the incredible efforts of our team to creatively engage with our customers, build our new business pipeline and our broad diversification across customer size, line of business and geography. 
We continue to be very pleased with how our team is prospecting new opportunities and leveraging our capabilities in both the traditional face-to-face model as well as virtually. National Programs segment grew 13% organically, delivering another outstanding quarter. Our growth was driven by strong performance from most programs due to new business as well as we realized continued rate increases for our wind and quake programs. 
Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered good organic growth of 6.8% for the quarter. Brokerage continues to grow faster as we realize improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage across property, general liability and professional liability. However, we continue to experience headwinds in our binding authority and personal lines businesses. Overall, Binding Authority grew but at a slower pace than we experienced in the past, primarily impacted by the pullback in cat capacity for property and the economic impact of COVID on small businesses. 
The Services segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue grew 5.7% and primarily driven by claims associated with recent weather -- winter weather events. Overall, it was a strong quarter, and we'd like to thank all of our teammates who continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. 
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
297244,709908033,2258824,"Brown & Brown, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Brown & Brown, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16",1129,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16.7% and organic revenue growth of 9.8% or $65.4 million. Our EBITDAC increased by 20.5%, growing faster than revenue as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our costs in response to COVID-19. Both of these factors were able to offset increased noncash stock-based compensation and lower margins associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters. 
Quick comment regarding our employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenue increased as compared to the prior year driven by approximately $10 million of higher noncash stock-based compensation cost. 
As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, we started issuing annual equity grants, which have a 5-year vesting period. For the full year, we are expecting noncash stock-based compensation expense to be similar to 2020. In addition, with the continued market recovery during the first quarter of 2021, there was an increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities as compared to a decrease in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a negative year-over-year impact to the compensation margin of nearly 200 basis points. 
The ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue decreased due to the continued management of our variable expenses in response to COVID, along with the benefit from the aforementioned change in deferred compensation costs. Please remember the impact on the EBITDAC margin associated with deferred compensation costs is substantially 0. 
Our income before income taxes increased by 16.5%, growing at a slightly slower pace than EBITDAC. This was driven primarily by the $10 million year-over-year increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Our net income increased by $47.3 million or 31%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 29.6% to $0.70. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 25.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate was driven by the benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. Please note the vesting of our stock awards will generally occur in the first quarter of each year. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the 23% to 24% range. 
Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. 
We're over on to Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. 
During the first quarter of 2021, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $900,000 as compared to a credit of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $54.7 million or 37.9%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.70, increasing 37.3%. Both measure faster than total revenue due to margin expansion and the lower effective tax rate for the quarter. 
Overall, it was a very strong quarter. Over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 16.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 12.2%. Our organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates increased by 9.8% for the first quarter. 
We're over on to Slide #9. Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.8% driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 9.8%, which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 80 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 19.5% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue and managing our expenses in response to COVID. 
The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average for the segment. Our income before income tax margin increased 10 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC due primarily to the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-outs and increased amortization expenses associated with recent acquisitions. 
Over to Slide 10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 20.6% and organic revenue by 13%. The increase in total revenue was driven by strong organic growth across many programs, acquisitions over the past 12 months and increased GSCs and contingent commissions. 
EBITDAC increased by $12.7 million or 30.8%, growing faster than total revenue due to leveraging our total revenue growth and lower variable costs in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes increased by $11.5 million or 38.9%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to slower growth in amortization and depreciation and lower intercompany interest expense. 
On Slide 11, our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 17% and organic revenue growth of 6.8%. Total revenue growth -- total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions, with contingent commissions and GSCs down slightly year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 20.6% and with a margin increase of 80 basis points as compared to the prior year, driven by leveraging of organic growth and lower variable expenses in response to COVID. 
This expansion was partially offset by the impact of lower contingents and GSCs. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was slower than total revenue growth primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
Slide #12. Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 5.7%, primarily due to increased claims associated with recent winter weather events. For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 21.4%, driven by the leveraging of revenue growth and managing our expense base in response to COVID-19. 
Income before income taxes decreased 7.9% due to a credit recorded for estimated acquisition earn-out payables in the prior year. Few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation as we delivered $125 million of cash flow from operations as compared to $34 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased to 15.3% this quarter, which is more in line with historic performance. 
Keep in mind that this ratio is generally the lowest in the first quarter due to the payment of year-end bonuses and then is much higher in the other quarters. With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we believe the speed of vaccine rollouts, the overall vaccination rate, the pace of state reopenings and any additional stimulus will ultimately influence business confidence and drive economic expansion. We believe there should be further economic improvement through the remainder of 2021. 
As we talk with our carrier partners, we expect premium rates to increase at similar levels through most of '21, but may moderate slightly in the second half of the year. Please remember, we're starting to see a gap between renewal increases and new business pricing. While M&A in the first quarter was a bit slow for the overall industry, we believe the acquisition space will remain very active and competitive between long-term strategics and temporary private equity sponsors. This will result in continued aggressive pricing for deals. 
However, we remain well positioned with our low leverage to capital on our balance sheet and access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity. Our pipeline remains good, and we're talking with lots of companies. We're very pleased with the progress of our technology and data initiatives. Our investments in technology continue to focus on the following areas: optimizing and enhancing our utilization of data and analytics, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes. 
The financial and operational performance for the first quarter was outstanding, and it was driven through the efforts of our 11,000-plus teammates and their commitment to help our customers win. While there may be some volatility in growth in future quarters, we have good momentum across the business, a highly diversified company, a great team, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. 
I would like to make 1 comment to the analysts during questions that we would encourage you to keep your questions to 2 questions. So we can allow everyone to cycle through. And if you have more than 2, you can get back in the queue. With that, let me turn it back over to Holly to start the Q&A session."

The second thing you need to understand in Retail is -- and we've talked about this before, but there is a heavy weighting on employee benefits in Q1 of the year.

So that will dampen some of the growth in the back end of the year. Again, still have growth, probably just not the level that we experienced in National Programs last year, even in Q1."

So you would not want to take that $10 million and somehow put it into the equation for Q1 of this year, that would not be an appropriate comparative. 
And then at least as to how we're thinking about the contingents and GSCs?  We had a good Q1. We did -- as we've talked about before, if there's normally going to be noise in any quarter, it will normally be the first quarter because that's when we generally receive a lot of our cash for what we accrued in the prior year. So you could either have ups or downs. We had a little bit of year-over-year benefit in Q1, not a tremendous amount.

Number two, as to your comment or statement around people leaving other firms or wherever they're leaving, we would remind you that we have nonsolicitation and nonpiracy agreements that we believe in, we abide by, and we expect others to do that. So if someone were to join us from another firm, we want them to abide by that. And if someone were to leave Brown & Brown, we would expect they would abide by that. That's the second thing. 
The merger that you talked about between those 2 large firms, it is, number one, you didn't ask this, but is it going to happen? And the answer is absolutely, I think it's going to happen. But they may have to sell more revenue than they anticipated initially. one, two, anything that time is not their friend. They want to get it done as quickly as possible. And therefore, there continues to be changes and you may read about people that are leaving or considering leaving or whatever the case may be. 
As it relates to acquisitions, I would like to remind you that acquisitions don't occur on our time line or on a quarterly basis, as you know, Greg, they occur when the sellers want to or they come to the conclusion that they're ready to part with what is many times their largest single asset. So it's not just a financial decision, it's an emotional decision as well. 
So we think that there's going to be plenty of opportunities from an acquisition standpoint. We think that there continues to be lots of change in the market. And what we've tried to do, as you know, is continue to build capabilities at Brown & Brown to enable our producers to be successful not only to retain their customers, but to write lots of new customers.

So Michael, I'm going to make some fairly broad statements, but remember, this would be most applicable to middle and upper middle market accounts, okay? So that's the first thing. So depending on where you are, there are certain areas in the country where we're starting to see it more often than not. 
So let's say, the Northeast or the Midwest, are areas where we're seeing it more commonly than maybe Denver in the Mountain states. And so that's an example. And so I want to clarify exactly what I'm saying because for those of you that have followed Brown & Brown for more than 5 or 6 or 7 years, you've heard this, this story before, which is the following. Basically, if you have an account, and let's say that account is in the Northeast, and it's a manufacturer or a beer distributor or whatever the case may be, and it has good loss experience and the incumbent company, whoever that is, wants a 6% or 7% rate increase overall on the account. That would not be -- it could be 3%, it could be 6% or 7%. Let's just say it's 6% for segregate discussion. If it was possible to take the exact account, something that looked exactly the same with the exact same loss experience and you submitted it to the market, it's a different name, it's a different account, but it looked exactly the same to the incumbent market that wanted the 6% rate increase on our customer they would write that. We're starting to see them write that at the expiring rates, okay? So why is that important? Saying that's happening universally across the board. I am not saying, we're not saying it's happening in every geographic area. But what we're saying is we're starting to see it, and it's not just in 1 area 1 account. So it may be anecdotal, but it's more broadly spaced than 1 geographic region. We believe that, that is the beginning of where you start to see some topping out in certain areas, and you're starting to see that in some of the rate increases because you can't have, let's just use in Florida property 20% on top of 20% on top of 20%, another 20%. I'm not saying it's not possible, but I'm saying the insured feels like they've been whipsawed and so we start to have customers that as rates continue to go up, they start thinking about terms and conditions. Terms, meaning do we change our deductible. Do we not buy that excess layer of something? Do we put a bigger deductible on our site -- whatever it is, there's multiple ways to manage cost but it's not just coverage, but it's such a huge issue on how to manage those cost increases. That also has a tendency to moderate the overall impact of the revenue increase on the account, it's important to note that."

You start talking to people in the services industries like restaurants and theme parks and related things, you see -- we're seeing people having a hard time hiring people back. So that business may be choppy. I'm not saying all of them are like this, but that might be 1 example on an extreme end. And on the other side, you might say, if you want to get a contractor, everywhere around the country seems to be not in major metropolitan areas, seems to be off the hook. So homebuilders and all kinds of stuff and the cost of wood and all that other stuff. So having said that, is that statement, a correct statement. I believe that, that statement is that face value probably fair. 
What I would say is this there is a difference between CEO or business owner confidence level and the way that you see people standing at the outside bar on your way home on a Friday night because the bar that I passed on the way home is passed and there's nobody with a mask, not a one, not in sight. And it's outside and everybody is allegedly, I say, apparently, there's no COVID at that bar. But what I'm trying to say is there's still a little gap there and until we start seeing business owners saying, we're all in, in terms of reinvesting in their business, buying new equipment, doing things like that. We're still not totally there. But do we think it is less choppy?  I think that, that's fair. And I also think that it depends on the industry. Certain industries are still just really bumpy.

I could not, and it's not about me, but I could not be more pleased at how our senior leadership team has navigated. What I would say is one of the most difficult unusual environments that any of us has ever been in. So having said that, this is different than the Great recession in 2008, '09, '10, '11, '12. And what I mean by that is there's lots of things that people have had to deal with different kinds of things as it relates to isolation, about mental wellness, I call it brain health. We call it brain health and things like that. And so what I would tell you is our teammates are pumped generally speaking, to come back in the office to see other teammates and allow them to have a separation of home and work. 
And so that's a long-winded answer, but we are very pleased how the senior leadership did. We are very pleased about the way they thought about investing in the way they thought about their businesses during this very difficult time. And equally as important is we're excited about the opportunity for new people to join our team and be large contributors to the progress on our way to $4 billion and beyond."

We had an outstanding quarter, probably one of the best in Brown & Brown's 82-year history. The results of the quarter are the outcome of the incredible efforts from our team, not only during the quarter, but over the last several years. Each of our segments had great performance, growing significantly on an organic basis and expanding margins due to more new business, good customer retention and increased premium rates across most lines of coverage. These results demonstrate how we are focused on enhancing our capabilities, improving the experience for our customers and delivering creative risk management solutions. 
From a customer segment standpoint, our large and middle market customers, which represent a significant portion of our revenue, recovered much quicker. However, smaller businesses are generally recovering at a slower pace. During the quarter, we released our first ESG report and are pleased to provide a view into our values as a company. We believe this report provides a comprehensive assessment of where we are in our evolution, but also lays out how we're thinking about the future. Hopefully, our current and future teammates, customers, carrier partners and investors will find the report demonstrates our commitment to these important topics.
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. As we -- as I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter and are very pleased with our results. We delivered $815 million of revenue growing 16.7% in total and 9.8% organically. This quarter represented one of the strongest quarters of organic growth since we began reporting this measure in the early 2000s. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin was 35.8%, which is up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the first quarter was $0.70, increasing 29.6% on an as-reported basis and 37.3% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. We're excited that O’Leary Insurances, which was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace, has joined the Brown & Brown team. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance as the team continues to fire on all cylinders and is focused on executing every day. Later in the presentation Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
I'm on Slide #4. The economy continues to recover with the vaccine rollout, and we're seeing improving business confidence. However, not all geographies or industries grew at the same pace. Premium rate increases in Q1 were similar to the last few quarters with some growing faster while others grew slower. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. Commercial auto rates are the exception as they remain up 10% or more. We're still not seeing positive workers' compensation rates, but they're getting closer to flat. Overall, the market is becoming more competitive in sections or areas, and we're starting to see carriers willing to bind coverage at the expiring rate for new business, but that same carrier would like to get an increase if it was their renewal.
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry. For these lines of coverage, there are definitely outliers. One area where we continue to see the most challenge right now is the E&S personal lines in Florida, California and the Gulf states due to the continued reduction in carrier appetite caused by fire, weather events and the increases in litigated claims over the past few years. We believe the reduction in personal lines capacity in cat areas will continue to decrease through at least 2021. 
The placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with losses continues to be challenging. We do not expect this trend to change for this year. We also believe that rate increases experienced in the first quarter will more than likely continue for most of 2021, but there may be some moderation in the second half of this year. We closed 2 transactions during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. As we've said in the past, our acquisition activity can vary by quarter as we're focused on ensuring a good cultural fit that makes sense financially. This disciplined approach has worked well for us over many years to deliver value from the companies that joined the Brown & Brown team. 
I'm now on Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered a record organic growth of 9.8% for the first quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of improving new business, good retention and continued rate increases. These results were only possible through the incredible efforts of our team to creatively engage with our customers, build our new business pipeline and our broad diversification across customer size, line of business and geography.
We continue to be very pleased with how our team is prospecting new opportunities and leveraging our capabilities in both the traditional face-to-face model as well as virtually. National Programs segment grew 13% organically, delivering another outstanding quarter. Our growth was driven by strong performance from most programs due to new business as well as we realized continued rate increases for our wind and quake programs. Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered good organic growth of 6.8% for the quarter. Brokerage continues to grow faster as we realize improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage across property, general liability and professional liability. 
However, we continue to experience headwinds in our Binding Authority and personal lines businesses. Overall, Binding Authority grew but at a slower pace than we experienced in the past, primarily impacted by the pullback in cat capacity for property and the economic impact of COVID on small businesses. The Services segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 5.7%, primarily driven by claims associated with recent weather -- winter weather events. Overall, it was a strong quarter, and we'd like to thank all of our teammates who continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
297244,709908033,2258927,"Brown & Brown, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Brown & Brown, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16",1127,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16.7% and organic revenue growth of 9.8% or $65.4 million. Our EBITDAC increased by 20.5%, growing faster than revenue as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our costs in response to COVID-19. Both of these factors were able to offset increased noncash stock-based compensation and lower margins associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters.
Quick comment regarding our employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenue increased as compared to the prior year, driven by approximately $10 million of higher noncash stock-based compensation cost. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, we started issuing annual equity grants, which have a 5-year vesting period. For the full year, we are expecting noncash stock-based compensation expense to be similar to 2020. 
In addition, with the continued market recovery during the first quarter of 2021, there was an increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities as compared to a decrease in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a negative year-over-year impact to the compensation margin of nearly 200 basis points. The ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue decreased due to the continued management of our variable expenses in response to COVID, along with the benefit from the aforementioned change in deferred compensation costs. 
Please remember the impact on the EBITDAC margin associated with deferred compensation costs is substantially zero. Our income before income taxes increased by 16.5%, growing at a slightly slower pace than EBITDAC. This was driven primarily by the $10 million year-over-year increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Our net income increased by $47.3 million or 31%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 29.6% to $0.70.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 25.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate was driven by the benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. Please note the vesting of our stock awards will generally occur in the first quarter of each year. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the first quarter 2020.
We're over on to Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. During the first quarter of 2021, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $900,000 as compared to a credit of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $54.7 million or 37.9%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.70, increasing 37.3%. Both measures grew faster than total revenue due to margin expansion and the lower effective tax rate for the quarter. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. 
Over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 16.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 12.2%. Our organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates, increased by 9.8% for the first quarter. 
We're over on to Slide #9. Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.8%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 9.8%, which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 80 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 19.5% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue and managing our expenses in response to COVID.
The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average for the segment. Our income before income tax margin increased 10 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC due primarily to the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-outs and increased amortization expenses associated with recent acquisitions.
Over to Slide 10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 20.6% and organic revenue by 13%. The increase in total revenue was driven by strong organic growth across many programs, acquisitions over the past 12 months and increased GSCs and contingent commissions. EBITDAC increased by $12.7 million or 30.8%, growing faster than total revenue due to leveraging our total revenue growth and lower variable costs in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes increased by $11.5 million or 38.9%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to slower growth in amortization and depreciation and lower intercompany interest expense.
On Slide 11, our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 17% and organic revenue growth of 6.8%. Total revenue growth -- total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions, with contingent commissions and GSCs down slightly year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 20.6% with a margin increase of 80 basis points as compared to the prior year, driven by leveraging of organic growth and lower variable expenses in response to COVID. This expansion was partially offset by the impact of lower contingents and GSCs. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was slower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
Slide #12. Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 5.7%, primarily due to increased claims associated with recent winter weather events. For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 21.4%, driven by the leveraging of revenue growth and managing our expense base in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes decreased 7.9% due to a credit recorded for estimated acquisition earn-out payables in the prior year. 
Few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation as we delivered $125 million of cash flow from operations as compared to $34 million in the first quarter 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased to 15.3% this quarter, which is more in line with historic performance. Keep in mind that this ratio is generally the lowest in the first quarter due to the payment of year-end bonuses and then is much higher in the other quarters. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we believe the speed of vaccine rollouts, the overall vaccination rate, the pace of state reopenings and any additional stimulus will ultimately influence business confidence and drive economic expansion. We believe there should be further economic improvement through the remainder of 2021.
As we talk with our carrier partners, we expect premium rates to increase at similar levels through most of '21, but may moderate slightly in the second half of the year. Please remember, we're starting to see a gap between renewal increases and new business pricing. While M&A in the first quarter was a bit slow for the overall industry, we believe the acquisition space will remain very active and competitive between long-term strategics and temporary private equity sponsors. This will result in continued aggressive pricing for deals.
However, we remain well positioned with our low leverage to capital on our balance sheet and access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity. Our pipeline remains good, and we're talking with lots of companies. We're very pleased with the progress of our technology and data initiatives. Our investments in technology continue to focus on the following areas: optimizing and enhancing our utilization of data and analytics, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services, and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.
The financial and operational performance for the first quarter was outstanding, and it was driven through the efforts of our 11,000-plus teammates and their commitment to help our customers win. While there may be some volatility in growth in future quarters, we have good momentum across the business, a highly diversified company, a great team, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. I would like to make 1 comment to the analysts during questions that we would encourage you to keep your questions to 2 questions, so we can allow everyone to cycle through. And if you have more than 2, you can get back in the queue.

And you recognized in your first quarter that the acquisition pipeline -- the acquisition numbers were a little bit light. Can you talk about producer retention at Brown & Brown? And can you talk about how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline for the balance of the year?"

So producer retention at Brown & Brown is good, and we're very pleased with that, number one. Number two, as to your comment or statement around people leaving other firms or wherever they're leaving, we would remind you that we have nonsolicitation",339,"Okay. So producer retention at Brown & Brown is good, and we're very pleased with that, number one. Number two, as to your comment or statement around people leaving other firms or wherever they're leaving, we would remind you that we have nonsolicitation and nonpiracy agreements that we believe in, we abide by, and we expect others to do that. So if someone were to join us from another firm, we want them to abide by that. And if someone were to leave Brown & Brown, we would expect they would abide by that. That's the second thing.
The merger that you talked about between those 2 large firms, it is, number one, you didn't ask this, but is it going to happen? And the answer is absolutely, I think it's going to happen. But they may have to sell more revenue than they anticipated initially, one. Two, anything that -- time is not their friend. They want to get it done as quickly as possible. And therefore, there continues to be changes and you may read about people that are leaving or considering leaving or whatever the case may be.
As it relates to acquisitions, I would like to remind you that acquisitions don't occur on our time line or on a quarterly basis, as you know, Greg. They occur when the sellers want to -- or they come to the conclusion that they're ready to part with what is many times their largest single asset. So it's not just a financial decision. It's an emotional decision as well. So we think that there's going to be plenty of opportunities from an acquisition standpoint. We think that there continues to be lots of change in the market. And what we've tried to do, as you know, is continue to build capabilities at Brown & Brown to enable our producers to be successful, not only to retain their customers, but to write lots of new customers. And so we are very pleased on where we are on that part."

So Michael, I'm going to make some fairly broad statements, but remember, this would be most applicable to middle and upper middle market accounts, okay? So that's the first thing.

So Michael, I'm going to make some fairly broad statements, but remember, this would be most applicable to middle and upper middle market accounts, okay? So that's the first thing. So depending on where you are, there are certain areas in the country where we're starting to see it more often than not. So let's say, the Northeast or the Midwest are areas where we're seeing it more commonly than maybe Denver in the Mountain states. And so that's an example. And so I want to clarify exactly what I'm saying because for those of you that have followed Brown & Brown for more than 5 or 6 or 7 years, you've heard this story before, which is the following. 
Basically, if you have an account, and let's say that account is in the Northeast, and it's a manufacturer or a beer distributor or whatever the case may be, and it has good loss experience. And the incumbent company, whoever that is, wants a 6% or 7% rate increase overall on the account, that would not be -- it could be 3%, it could be 6% or 7%. Let's just say it's 6% for sake of this discussion. If it was possible to take the exact account, something that looked exactly the same, with the exact same loss experience and you submitted it to the market, it's a different name, it's a different account, but it looked exactly the same to the incumbent market that wanted the 6% rate increase on our customer, they would write that. We're starting to see them write that at the expiring rates, okay? 
So why is that important? I'm not saying that's happening universally across the board. I am not saying -- we're not saying it's happening in every geographic area. But what we're saying is we're starting to see it, and it's not just in 1 area or 1 account. So it may be anecdotal, but it's more broadly spaced than 1 geographic region. We believe that, that is the beginning of -- where you start to see some topping out in certain areas, and you're starting to see that in some of the rate increases because you can't have, let's just use in Florida property, 20% on top of 20% on top of 20%, another 20%. 
I'm not saying it's not possible, but I'm saying the insured feels like they've been whipsawed. And so we start to have customers that as rates continue to go up, they start thinking about terms and conditions. Terms, meaning do we change our deductible? Do we not buy that excess layer of something? Do we put a bigger deductible on our site -- whatever it is, there's multiple ways to manage cost but it's not just coverage, but it's such a huge issue on how to manage those cost increases. That also has a tendency to moderate the overall impact of the revenue increase on the account. It's important to note that."

So having said that, you are tapping on something that is universally applicable across the entire platform and all of the divisions, but specifically Retail, Wholesale and Programs, which is capacity, meaning new capacity. That could be new capacity and liability, new capacity and property, new capacity and professional liability.
And so in the first quarter and just like in prior quarters, we do have some very good relationships with carrier partners that have enabled us to win with them, to deliver winning solutions to our customers. And we're constantly and consistently looking for those new solutions. So what worked last year may not work this year, as you know. So we are constantly searching the marketplace, not just domestically, but kind of worldwide for capacity to deliver either a product, which could be in our Retail space or on a basis of more proprietary product through our Wholesale or Programs space.

And on the other side, you might say, if you want to get a contractor, everywhere around the country seems to be -- not in major metropolitan areas -- seems to be off the hook. So homebuilders and all kinds of stuff and the cost of wood and all that other stuff. So having said that, is that statement a correct statement? I believe that, that statement is at face value probably fair. 
What I would say is this. There is a difference between CEO or business owner confidence level and the way that you see people standing at the outside bar on your way home on a Friday night because the bar that I passed on the way home is packed. And there's nobody with a mask, not a one, not in sight. And it's outside and everybody is allegedly -- I'd say, apparently, there's no COVID at that bar. But what I'm trying to say is there's still a little gap there. And until we start seeing business owners saying, we're all in, in terms of reinvesting in their business, buying new equipment, doing things like that, we're still not totally there. But do we think it is less choppy? I think that, that's fair. And I also think that it depends on the industry. Certain industries are still just really bumpy.

But what I would say is this. We want to see our customers, and they want to see us. So there is a feeling of desire on both parts to see people.

We had an outstanding quarter, probably one of the best in Brown & Brown's 82-year history. The results of the quarter are the outcome of the incredible efforts from our team, not only during the quarter, but over the last several years. Each of our segments had great performance, growing significantly on an organic basis and expanding margins due to more new business, good customer retention and increased premium rates across most lines of coverage. These results demonstrate how we are focused on enhancing our capabilities, improving the experience for our customers and delivering creative risk management solutions. 
From a customer segment standpoint, our large and middle market customers, which represent a significant portion of our revenue, recovered much quicker. However, smaller businesses are generally recovering at a slower pace. During the quarter, we released our first ESG report and are pleased to provide a view into our values as a company. We believe this report provides a comprehensive assessment of where we are in our evolution, but also lays out how we're thinking about the future. Hopefully, our current and future teammates, customers, carrier partners and investors will find the report demonstrates our commitment to these important topics.
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. As we -- as I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter and are very pleased with our results. We delivered $815 million of revenue growing 16.7% in total and 9.8% organically. This quarter represented one of the strongest quarters of organic growth since we began reporting this measure in the early 2000s. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin was 35.8%, which is up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the first quarter was $0.70, increasing 29.6% on an as-reported basis and 37.3% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. We're excited that O’Leary Insurances, which was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace, has joined the Brown & Brown team. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance as the team continues to fire on all cylinders and is focused on executing every day. Later in the presentation Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
I'm on Slide #4. The economy continues to recover with the vaccine rollout, and we're seeing improving business confidence. However, not all geographies or industries grew at the same pace. Premium rate increases in Q1 were similar to the last few quarters with some growing faster while others grew slower. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. Commercial auto rates are the exception as they remain up 10% or more. We're still not seeing positive workers' compensation rates, but they're getting closer to flat. Overall, the market is becoming more competitive in sections or areas, and we're starting to see carriers willing to bind coverage at the expiring rate for new business, but that same carrier would like to get an increase if it was their renewal.
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry. For these lines of coverage, there are definitely outliers. One area where we continue to see the most challenge right now is the E&S personal lines in Florida, California and the Gulf states due to the continued reduction in carrier appetite caused by fire, weather events and the increases in litigated claims over the past few years. We believe the reduction in personal lines capacity in cat areas will continue to decrease through at least 2021. 
The placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with losses continues to be challenging. We do not expect this trend to change for this year. We also believe that rate increases experienced in the first quarter will more than likely continue for most of 2021, but there may be some moderation in the second half of this year. We closed 2 transactions during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. As we've said in the past, our acquisition activity can vary by quarter as we're focused on ensuring a good cultural fit that makes sense financially. This disciplined approach has worked well for us over many years to deliver value from the companies that joined the Brown & Brown team. 
I'm now on Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered a record organic growth of 9.8% for the first quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of improving new business, good retention and continued rate increases. These results were only possible through the incredible efforts of our team to creatively engage with our customers, build our new business pipeline and our broad diversification across customer size, line of business and geography.
We continue to be very pleased with how our team is prospecting new opportunities and leveraging our capabilities in both the traditional face-to-face model as well as virtually. National Programs segment grew 13% organically, delivering another outstanding quarter. Our growth was driven by strong performance from most programs due to new business as well as we realized continued rate increases for our wind and quake programs. Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered good organic growth of 6.8% for the quarter. Brokerage continues to grow faster as we realize improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage across property, general liability and professional liability. 
However, we continue to experience headwinds in our Binding Authority and personal lines businesses. Overall, Binding Authority grew but at a slower pace than we experienced in the past, primarily impacted by the pullback in cat capacity for property and the economic impact of COVID on small businesses. The Services segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 5.7%, primarily driven by claims associated with recent weather -- winter weather events. Overall, it was a strong quarter, and we'd like to thank all of our teammates who continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
297244,709908033,2259487,"Brown & Brown, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Brown & Brown, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16",1127,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16.7% and organic revenue growth of 9.8% or $65.4 million. Our EBITDAC increased by 20.5%, growing faster than revenue as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our costs in response to COVID-19. Both of these factors were able to offset increased noncash stock-based compensation and lower margins associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters.
Quick comment regarding our employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenue increased as compared to the prior year, driven by approximately $10 million of higher noncash stock-based compensation cost. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, we started issuing annual equity grants, which have a 5-year vesting period. For the full year, we are expecting noncash stock-based compensation expense to be similar to 2020. 
In addition, with the continued market recovery during the first quarter of 2021, there was an increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities as compared to a decrease in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a negative year-over-year impact to the compensation margin of nearly 200 basis points. The ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue decreased due to the continued management of our variable expenses in response to COVID, along with the benefit from the aforementioned change in deferred compensation costs. 
Please remember the impact on the EBITDAC margin associated with deferred compensation costs is substantially zero. Our income before income taxes increased by 16.5%, growing at a slightly slower pace than EBITDAC. This was driven primarily by the $10 million year-over-year increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Our net income increased by $47.3 million or 31%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 29.6% to $0.70.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 25.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate was driven by the benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. Please note the vesting of our stock awards will generally occur in the first quarter of each year. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the first quarter 2020.
We're over on to Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. During the first quarter of 2021, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $900,000 as compared to a credit of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $54.7 million or 37.9%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.70, increasing 37.3%. Both measures grew faster than total revenue due to margin expansion and the lower effective tax rate for the quarter. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. 
Over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 16.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 12.2%. Our organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates, increased by 9.8% for the first quarter. 
We're over on to Slide #9. Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.8%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 9.8%, which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 80 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 19.5% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue and managing our expenses in response to COVID.
The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average for the segment. Our income before income tax margin increased 10 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC due primarily to the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-outs and increased amortization expenses associated with recent acquisitions.
Over to Slide 10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 20.6% and organic revenue by 13%. The increase in total revenue was driven by strong organic growth across many programs, acquisitions over the past 12 months and increased GSCs and contingent commissions. EBITDAC increased by $12.7 million or 30.8%, growing faster than total revenue due to leveraging our total revenue growth and lower variable costs in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes increased by $11.5 million or 38.9%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to slower growth in amortization and depreciation and lower intercompany interest expense.
On Slide 11, our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 17% and organic revenue growth of 6.8%. Total revenue growth -- total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions, with contingent commissions and GSCs down slightly year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 20.6% with a margin increase of 80 basis points as compared to the prior year, driven by leveraging of organic growth and lower variable expenses in response to COVID. This expansion was partially offset by the impact of lower contingents and GSCs. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was slower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
Slide #12. Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 5.7%, primarily due to increased claims associated with recent winter weather events. For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 21.4%, driven by the leveraging of revenue growth and managing our expense base in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes decreased 7.9% due to a credit recorded for estimated acquisition earn-out payables in the prior year. 
Few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation as we delivered $125 million of cash flow from operations as compared to $34 million in the first quarter 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased to 15.3% this quarter, which is more in line with historic performance. Keep in mind that this ratio is generally the lowest in the first quarter due to the payment of year-end bonuses and then is much higher in the other quarters. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we believe the speed of vaccine rollouts, the overall vaccination rate, the pace of state reopenings and any additional stimulus will ultimately influence business confidence and drive economic expansion. We believe there should be further economic improvement through the remainder of 2021.
As we talk with our carrier partners, we expect premium rates to increase at similar levels through most of '21, but may moderate slightly in the second half of the year. Please remember, we're starting to see a gap between renewal increases and new business pricing. While M&A in the first quarter was a bit slow for the overall industry, we believe the acquisition space will remain very active and competitive between long-term strategics and temporary private equity sponsors. This will result in continued aggressive pricing for deals.
However, we remain well positioned with our low leverage to capital on our balance sheet and access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity. Our pipeline remains good, and we're talking with lots of companies. We're very pleased with the progress of our technology and data initiatives. Our investments in technology continue to focus on the following areas: optimizing and enhancing our utilization of data and analytics, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services, and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.
The financial and operational performance for the first quarter was outstanding, and it was driven through the efforts of our 11,000-plus teammates and their commitment to help our customers win. While there may be some volatility in growth in future quarters, we have good momentum across the business, a highly diversified company, a great team, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. I would like to make one comment to the analysts during questions that we would encourage you to keep your questions to 2 questions, so we can allow everyone to cycle through. And if you have more than 2, you can get back in the queue.

Powell, you mentioned in your closing comments that the economic improvement should continue during the remainder of the year. You also alluded to still healthy price increases, maybe some level of moderation. But if we combine that with, what looks like a pretty impressive Q1 organic number, should we think about the back 3 quarters to just continuing to accelerate, given that the comps, right, will get much easier given COVID compressed organic in the back 3 quarters of last year?"

So we don't give, as you know, organic growth guidance. But based on what you have said, those are positive things against the comps in the next 3 quarters. But I don't want you to get ahead of yourself, too."

So that will dampen some of the growth in the back end of the year. Again, still have growth, probably just not the level that we experienced in National Programs last year, even in Q1."

And then at least as to how we're thinking about the contingents and GSCs, we had a good Q1. We did -- as we've talked about before, if there's normally going to be noise in any quarter, it will normally be the first quarter because that's when we generally receive a lot of our cash for what we accrued in the prior year. So you could either have ups or downs. We had a little bit of year-over-year benefit in Q1, not a tremendous amount.

Number two, as to your comment or statement around people leaving other firms or wherever they're leaving, we would remind you that we have nonsolicitation and nonpiracy agreements that we believe in, we abide by, and we expect others to do that. So if someone were to join us from another firm, we want them to abide by that. And if someone were to leave Brown & Brown, we would expect they would abide by that. That's the second thing.
The merger that you talked about between those 2 large firms, it is, number one, you didn't ask this, but is it going to happen? And the answer is absolutely, I think it's going to happen. But they may have to sell more revenue than they anticipated initially, one. Two, anything that -- time is not their friend. They want to get it done as quickly as possible. And therefore, there continues to be changes and you may read about people that are leaving or considering leaving or whatever the case may be.
As it relates to acquisitions, I would like to remind you that acquisitions don't occur on our time line or on a quarterly basis, as you know, Greg. They occur when the sellers want to -- or they come to the conclusion that they're ready to part with what is many times their largest single asset. So it's not just a financial decision. It's an emotional decision as well. So we think that there's going to be plenty of opportunities from an acquisition standpoint. We think that there continues to be lots of change in the market. And what we've tried to do, as you know, is continue to build capabilities at Brown & Brown to enable our producers to be successful, not only to retain their customers, but to write lots of new customers.

So Michael, I'm going to make some fairly broad statements, but remember, this would be most applicable to middle and upper middle market accounts, okay? So that's the first thing.

So Michael, I'm going to make some fairly broad statements, but remember, this would be most applicable to middle and upper middle market accounts, okay? So that's the first thing. So depending on where you are, there are certain areas in the country where we're starting to see it more often than not. So let's say, the Northeast or the Midwest are areas where we're seeing it more commonly than maybe Denver in the Mountain states. And so that's an example. And so I want to clarify exactly what I'm saying because for those of you that have followed Brown & Brown for more than 5 or 6 or 7 years, you've heard this story before, which is the following. 
Basically, if you have an account, and let's say that account is in the Northeast, and it's a manufacturer or a beer distributor or whatever the case may be, and it has good loss experience. And the incumbent company, whoever that is, wants a 6% or 7% rate increase overall on the account, that would not be -- it could be 3%, it could be 6% or 7%. Let's just say it's 6% for sake of this discussion. If it was possible to take the exact account, something that looked exactly the same, with the exact same loss experience and you submitted it to the market, it's a different name, it's a different account, but it looked exactly the same to the incumbent market that wanted the 6% rate increase on our customer, they would write that. We're starting to see them write that at the expiring rates, okay? 
So why is that important? I'm not saying that's happening universally across the board. I am not saying -- we're not saying it's happening in every geographic area. But what we're saying is we're starting to see it, and it's not just in 1 area or 1 account. So it may be anecdotal, but it's more broadly spaced than 1 geographic region. We believe that, that is the beginning of -- where you start to see some topping out in certain areas, and you're starting to see that in some of the rate increases because you can't have, let's just use in Florida property, 20% on top of 20% on top of 20%, another 20%. 
I'm not saying it's not possible, but I'm saying the insured feels like they've been whipsawed. And so we start to have customers that as rates continue to go up, they start thinking about terms and conditions. Terms, meaning do we change our deductible? Do we not buy that excess layer of something? Do we put a bigger deductible on our site -- whatever it is, there's multiple ways to manage cost but it's not just coverage, but it's such a huge issue on how to manage those cost increases. That also has a tendency to moderate the overall impact of the revenue increase on the account. It's important to note that."

That could be new capacity and liability, new capacity and property, new capacity and professional liability.
And so in the first quarter and just like in prior quarters, we do have some very good relationships with carrier partners that have enabled us to win with them, to deliver winning solutions to our customers. And we're constantly and consistently looking for those new solutions. So what worked last year may not work this year, as you know. So we are constantly searching the marketplace, not just domestically, but kind of worldwide for capacity to deliver either a product, which could be in our Retail space or on a basis of more proprietary product through our Wholesale or Programs space.

So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. So if there is a cultural fit and makes financial sense, you are open to opportunities, even if they would be outside of the norm or of the core type of acquisitions that you've done in the past?

So Phil, I think that choppiness now would be more specifically defined as in certain industries. So I'll give you an example. You start talking to people in the services industries like restaurants and theme parks and related things you see -- where you're seeing people having a hard time hiring people back. So that business may be choppy. I'm not saying all of them are like this, but that might be one example on an extreme end. And on the other side, you might say, if you want to get a contractor, everywhere around the country seems to be -- not in major metropolitan areas -- seems to be off the hook. So homebuilders and all kinds of stuff and the cost of wood and all that other stuff. So having said that, is that statement a correct statement? I believe that, that statement is at face value probably fair. 
What I would say is this. There is a difference between CEO or business owner confidence level and the way that you see people standing at the outside bar on your way home on a Friday night because the bar that I passed on the way home is packed. And there's nobody with a mask, not a one, not in sight. And it's outside and everybody is allegedly -- I'd say, apparently, there's no COVID at that bar. But what I'm trying to say is there's still a little gap there. And until we start seeing business owners saying, we're all in, in terms of reinvesting in their business, buying new equipment, doing things like that, we're still not totally there. But do we think it is less choppy? I think that, that's fair. And I also think that it depends on the industry. Certain industries are still just really bumpy. And then others are coming back with vengeance."

I could not -- and it's not about me, but I could not be more pleased at how our senior leadership team has navigated, what I would say, is one of the most difficult, unusual environments that any of us has ever been in. 
So having said that, this is different than the Great Recession in 2008, '09, '10, '11, '12. And what I mean by that is there's lot of things that people have had to deal with, different kinds of things as it relates to isolation, about mental wellness, I call it brain health -- we call it brain health and things like that. And so what I would tell you is our teammates are pumped, generally speaking, to come back in the office, to see other teammates and allow them to have a separation of home and work. And so that's a long-winded answer, but we are very pleased how the senior leadership did. We are very pleased about the way they thought about investing, in the way they thought about their businesses during this very difficult time. And equally as important is we're excited about the opportunity for new people to join our team and be large contributors to the progress on our way to $4 billion and beyond."

We had an outstanding quarter, probably one of the best in Brown & Brown's 82-year history. The results of the quarter are the outcome of the incredible efforts from our team, not only during the quarter, but over the last several years. Each of our segments had great performance, growing significantly on an organic basis and expanding margins due to more new business, good customer retention and increased premium rates across most lines of coverage. These results demonstrate how we are focused on enhancing our capabilities, improving the experience for our customers and delivering creative risk management solutions. 
From a customer segment standpoint, our large and middle market customers, which represent a significant portion of our revenue, recovered much quicker. However, smaller businesses are generally recovering at a slower pace. During the quarter, we released our first ESG report and are pleased to provide a view into our values as a company. We believe this report provides a comprehensive assessment of where we are in our evolution, but also lays out how we're thinking about the future. Hopefully, our current and future teammates, customers, carrier partners and investors will find the report demonstrates our commitment to these important topics.
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. As we -- as I mentioned, we had an excellent quarter and are very pleased with our results. We delivered $815 million of revenue growing 16.7% in total and 9.8% organically. This quarter represented one of the strongest quarters of organic growth since we began reporting this measure in the early 2000s. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin was 35.8%, which is up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the first quarter was $0.70, increasing 29.6% on an as-reported basis and 37.3% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. We're excited that Oâ€™Leary Insurances, which was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace, has joined the Brown & Brown team. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance as the team continues to fire on all cylinders and is focused on executing every day. Later in the presentation Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
I'm on Slide #4. The economy continues to recover with the vaccine rollout, and we're seeing improving business confidence. However, not all geographies or industries grew at the same pace. Premium rate increases in Q1 were similar to the last few quarters with some growing faster while others grew slower. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. Commercial auto rates are the exception as they remain up 10% or more. We're still not seeing positive workers' compensation rates, but they're getting closer to flat. Overall, the market is becoming more competitive in sections or areas, and we're starting to see carriers willing to bind coverage at the expiring rate for new business, but that same carrier would like to get an increase if it was their renewal.
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. Professional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry. For these lines of coverage, there are definitely outliers. One area where we continue to see the most challenge right now is the E&S personal lines in Florida, California and the Gulf states due to the continued reduction in carrier appetite caused by fire, weather events and the increases in litigated claims over the past few years. We believe the reduction in personal lines capacity in cat areas will continue to decrease through at least 2021. 
The placement of coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with losses continues to be challenging. We do not expect this trend to change for this year. We also believe that rate increases experienced in the first quarter will more than likely continue for most of 2021, but there may be some moderation in the second half of this year. We closed 2 transactions during the quarter with annual revenue of approximately $33 million. As we've said in the past, our acquisition activity can vary by quarter as we're focused on ensuring a good cultural fit that makes sense financially. This disciplined approach has worked well for us over many years to deliver value from the companies that joined the Brown & Brown team. 
I'm now on Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered a record organic growth of 9.8% for the first quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of improving new business, good retention and continued rate increases. These results were only possible through the incredible efforts of our team to creatively engage with our customers, build our new business pipeline and our broad diversification across customer size, line of business and geography.
We continue to be very pleased with how our team is prospecting new opportunities and leveraging our capabilities in both the traditional face-to-face model as well as virtually. National Programs segment grew 13% organically, delivering another outstanding quarter. Our growth was driven by strong performance from most programs due to new business as well as we realized continued rate increases for our wind and quake programs. Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered good organic growth of 6.8% for the quarter. Brokerage continues to grow faster as we realize improving new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage across property, general liability and professional liability. 
However, we continue to experience headwinds in our Binding Authority and personal lines businesses. Overall, Binding Authority grew but at a slower pace than we experienced in the past, primarily impacted by the pullback in cat capacity for property and the economic impact of COVID on small businesses. The Services segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 5.7%, primarily driven by claims associated with recent weather -- winter weather events. Overall, it was a strong quarter, and we'd like to thank all of our teammates who continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."
297244,709908033,2259545,"Brown & Brown, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Brown & Brown, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16",1127,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on to Slide 6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the first quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $116.8 million or 16.7% and organic revenue growth of 9.8% or $65.4 million. Our EBITDAC increased by 20.5%, growing faster than revenue as we were able to leverage our expense base and further manage our costs in response to COVID-19. Both of these factors were able to offset increased noncash stock-based compensation and lower margins associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters.
Quick comment regarding our employee compensation and benefits and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The ratio of employee compensation and benefits to total revenue increased as compared to the prior year, driven by approximately $10 million of higher noncash stock-based compensation cost. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, we started issuing annual equity grants, which have a 5-year vesting period. For the full year, we are expecting noncash stock-based compensation expense to be similar to 2020. 
In addition, with the continued market recovery during the first quarter of 2021, there was an increase in the value of deferred compensation liabilities as compared to a decrease in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a negative year-over-year impact to the compensation margin of nearly 200 basis points. The ratio of other operating expenses to total revenue decreased due to the continued management of our variable expenses in response to COVID, along with the benefit from the aforementioned change in deferred compensation costs. 
Please remember the impact on the EBITDAC margin associated with deferred compensation costs is substantially zero. Our income before income taxes increased by 16.5%, growing at a slightly slower pace than EBITDAC. This was driven primarily by the $10 million year-over-year increase in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. Our net income increased by $47.3 million or 31%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 29.6% to $0.70.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% compared to 25.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The lower effective tax rate was driven by the benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. Please note the vesting of our stock awards will generally occur in the first quarter of each year. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the first quarter 2020.
We're over on to Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. We believe this presentation provides a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. During the first quarter of 2021, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $900,000 as compared to a credit of $11 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $54.7 million or 37.9%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.70, increasing 37.3%. Both measures grew faster than total revenue due to margin expansion and the lower effective tax rate for the quarter. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. 
Over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 16.9%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 12.2%. Our organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates, increased by 9.8% for the first quarter. 
We're over on to Slide #9. Our Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.8%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 9.8%, which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 80 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 19.5% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue and managing our expenses in response to COVID.
The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average for the segment. Our income before income tax margin increased 10 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC due primarily to the year-over-year change in estimated acquisition earn-outs and increased amortization expenses associated with recent acquisitions.
Over to Slide 10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 20.6% and organic revenue by 13%. The increase in total revenue was driven by strong organic growth across many programs, acquisitions over the past 12 months and increased GSCs and contingent commissions. EBITDAC increased by $12.7 million or 30.8%, growing faster than total revenue due to leveraging our total revenue growth and lower variable costs in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes increased by $11.5 million or 38.9%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to slower growth in amortization and depreciation and lower intercompany interest expense.
On Slide 11, our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 17% and organic revenue growth of 6.8%. Total revenue growth -- total revenue grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions, with contingent commissions and GSCs down slightly year-over-year. EBITDAC grew by 20.6% with a margin increase of 80 basis points as compared to the prior year, driven by leveraging of organic growth and lower variable expenses in response to COVID. This expansion was partially offset by the impact of lower contingents and GSCs. Our income before income taxes grew by 6.2%, which was slower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
Slide #12. Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 5.7%, primarily due to increased claims associated with recent winter weather events. For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 21.4%, driven by the leveraging of revenue growth and managing our expense base in response to COVID-19. Income before income taxes decreased 7.9% due to a credit recorded for estimated acquisition earn-out payables in the prior year. 
Few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation as we delivered $125 million of cash flow from operations as compared to $34 million in the first quarter 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased to 15.3% this quarter, which is more in line with historic performance. Keep in mind that this ratio is generally the lowest in the first quarter due to the payment of year-end bonuses and then is much higher in the other quarters. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we believe the speed of vaccine rollouts, the overall vaccination rate, the pace of state reopenings and any additional stimulus will ultimately influence business confidence and drive economic expansion. We believe there should be further economic improvement through the remainder of 2021.
As we talk with our carrier partners, we expect premium rates to increase at similar levels through most of '21, but may moderate slightly in the second half of the year. Please remember, we're starting to see a gap between renewal increases and new business pricing. While M&A in the first quarter was a bit slow for the overall industry, we believe the acquisition space will remain very active and competitive between long-term strategics and temporary private equity sponsors. This will result in continued aggressive pricing for deals.
However, we remain well positioned with our low leverage to capital on our balance sheet and access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity. Our pipeline remains good, and we're talking with lots of companies. We're very pleased with the progress of our technology and data initiatives. Our investments in technology continue to focus on the following areas: optimizing and enhancing our utilization of data and analytics, expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services, and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.
The financial and operational performance for the first quarter was outstanding, and it was driven through the efforts of our 11,000-plus teammates and their commitment to help our customers win. While there may be some volatility in growth in future quarters, we have good momentum across the business, a highly diversified company, a great team, and we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. I would like to make one comment to the analysts during questions that we would encourage you to keep your questions to 2 questions, so we can allow everyone to cycle through. And if you have more than 2, you can get back in the queue. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Holly to start the Q&A session."

That's the first thing. The second thing you need to understand in Retail is -- and we've talked about this before, but there is a heavy weighting on employee benefits in Q1 of the year. So we don't give, as you know, organic growth guidance. But based on what you have said, those are positive things against the comps in the next 3 quarters.

So that will dampen some of the growth in the back end of the year. Again, still have growth, probably just not the level that we experienced in National Programs last year, even in Q1."

So you would not want to take that $10 million and somehow put it into the equation for Q1 of this year. That would not be an appropriate comparative. Okay.
And then at least as to how we're thinking about the contingents and GSCs, we had a good Q1. We did -- as we've talked about before, if there's normally going to be noise in any quarter, it will normally be the first quarter because that's when we generally receive a lot of our cash for what we accrued in the prior year. So you could either have ups or downs. We had a little bit of year-over-year benefit in Q1, not a tremendous amount.

The merger that you talked about between those 2 large firms, it is, number one, you didn't ask this, but is it going to happen? And the answer is absolutely, I think it's going to happen. But they may have to sell more revenue than they anticipated initially, one. Two, anything that -- time is not their friend. They want to get it done as quickly as possible. And therefore, there continues to be changes and you may read about people that are leaving or considering leaving or whatever the case may be.
As it relates to acquisitions, I would like to remind you that acquisitions don't occur on our time line or on a quarterly basis, as you know, Greg. They occur when the sellers want to -- or they come to the conclusion that they're ready to part with what is many times their largest single asset. So it's not just a financial decision. It's an emotional decision as well. So we think that there's going to be plenty of opportunities from an acquisition standpoint. We think that there continues to be lots of change in the market. And what we've tried to do, as you know, is continue to build capabilities at Brown & Brown to enable our producers to be successful, not only to retain their customers, but to write lots of new customers.

So let's say, the Northeast or the Midwest are areas where we're seeing it more commonly than maybe Denver in the Mountain states. And so that's an example. And so I want to clarify exactly what I'm saying because for those of you that have followed Brown & Brown for more than 5 or 6 or 7 years, you've heard this story before, which is the following. 
Basically, if you have an account, and let's say that account is in the Northeast, and it's a manufacturer or a beer distributor or whatever the case may be, and it has good loss experience. And the incumbent company, whoever that is, wants a 6% or 7% rate increase overall on the account, that would not be -- it could be 3%, it could be 6% or 7%. Let's just say it's 6% for sake of this discussion. If it was possible to take the exact account, something that looked exactly the same, with the exact same loss experience and you submitted it to the market, it's a different name, it's a different account, but it looked exactly the same to the incumbent market that wanted the 6% rate increase on our customer, they would write that. We're starting to see them write that at the expiring rates, okay? 
So why is that important? I'm not saying that's happening universally across the board. I am not saying -- we're not saying it's happening in every geographic area. But what we're saying is we're starting to see it, and it's not just in 1 area or 1 account. So it may be anecdotal, but it's more broadly spaced than 1 geographic region. We believe that, that is the beginning of -- where you start to see some topping out in certain areas, and you're starting to see that in some of the rate increases because you can't have, let's just use in Florida property, 20% on top of 20% on top of 20%, another 20%. 
I'm not saying it's not possible, but I'm saying the insured feels like they've been whipsawed. And so we start to have customers that as rates continue to go up, they start thinking about terms and conditions. Terms, meaning do we change our deductible? Do we not buy that excess layer of something? Do we put a bigger deductible on our site -- whatever it is, there's multiple ways to manage cost but it's not just coverage, but it's such a huge issue on how to manage those cost increases. That also has a tendency to moderate the overall impact of the revenue increase on the account. It's important to note that."

Having said that, we have said that we wrote a lot of new business in Q1. So I do want to make sure you heard that. We wrote a lot of new business in Q1, and we're happy about that. So having said that, you are tapping on something that is universally applicable across the entire platform and all of the divisions, but specifically Retail, Wholesale and Programs, which is capacity, meaning new capacity. That could be new capacity and liability, new capacity and property, new capacity and professional liability.
And so in the first quarter and just like in prior quarters, we do have some very good relationships with carrier partners that have enabled us to win with them, to deliver winning solutions to our customers. And we're constantly and consistently looking for those new solutions. So what worked last year may not work this year, as you know. So we are constantly searching the marketplace, not just domestically, but kind of worldwide for capacity to deliver either a product, which could be in our Retail space or on a basis of more proprietary product through our Wholesale or Programs space. I hope that answered your question."

You start talking to people in the services industries like restaurants and theme parks and related things you see -- where you're seeing people having a hard time hiring people back. So that business may be choppy. I'm not saying all of them are like this, but that might be one example on an extreme end. And on the other side, you might say, if you want to get a contractor, everywhere around the country seems to be -- not in major metropolitan areas -- seems to be off the hook. So homebuilders and all kinds of stuff and the cost of wood and all that other stuff. So having said that, is that statement a correct statement? I believe that, that statement is at face value probably fair. 
What I would say is this. There is a difference between CEO or business owner confidence level and the way that you see people standing at the outside bar on your way home on a Friday night because the bar that I passed on the way home is packed. And there's nobody with a mask, not a one, not in sight. And it's outside and everybody is allegedly -- I'd say, apparently, there's no COVID at that bar. But what I'm trying to say is there's still a little gap there. And until we start seeing business owners saying, we're all in, in terms of reinvesting in their business, buying new equipment, doing things like that, we're still not totally there. But do we think it is less choppy? I think that, that's fair. And I also think that it depends on the industry. Certain industries are still just really bumpy. And then others are coming back with vengeance."

But what I would say is this. We want to see our customers, and they want to see us. So there is a feeling of desire on both parts to see people. So we think that in some businesses that will pick up more quickly than others. Do we think it will be back to so-called what it was before by the end of the year? I don't know about that. But I think that we're going to see absolutely a pickup. And if, in fact, the COVID vaccination rollouts and COVID in America continues to move in the right direction, meaning not spike or things like that, I think that's going to add to it."

Q2 was a very strong quarter and it's the best in the history of Brown & Brown. Our performance for the first 6 months of 2021 is due to the tremendous effort of our talented 11,000-plus teammates that deliver creative risk management solutions for our customers. Each of our segments delivered impressive results with strong top and bottom line growth due to more new business, good customer retention, increased premium rates across most lines of coverage and higher exposure units driven by continued economic expansion. These results reflect the strength and diversity of our operating model as well as the power of our performance-based culture. 
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $727 million of revenue, growing 21.5% in total and 14.7% organically. This is the strongest organic growth that we've ever delivered. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. 
Our EBITDAC margin was 32.9%, which is up 340 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the second quarter was $0.49, increasing 44% on an as-reported and adjusted basis, with the latter excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance and believe we're well positioned to continue to deliver best-in-class solutions for our customers. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
On Slide 4, let's start with the economy and what we saw during the quarter. As companies continue to reopen and strengthen, business confidence is improving. However, not all companies are back 100%. We continue to hear about struggles with certain customer segments in hiring workers. We think this will work itself out over the coming months and quarters, but these open roles are serving as a bit of a governor on the speed of recovery. Due to this uncertainty, customers remain very focused on their insurance spend and, therefore, managing the deductibles and aggregate limits. 
Rates were generally in line with what we experienced in the first quarter. However, we started to see some moderation to the level of increases in certain admitted and non-admitted lines. Certain customers and industries with high losses remain a placement challenge. However, we continue to see carriers seeking higher rate increases on renewal business while quoting at or below expiring rates for a new business of a similar risk profile. Diluted rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. The outliers are workers' compensation rates, which remain down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which are up 5% to 10%. 
From an E&S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quick are 15% to 25%. However, near the end of the quarter, we started to see less upward pressure on less upward rate pressure on renewals. 
Professional liability for most accounts remains challenging, the SPAC market, in particular. Professional liability rates are generally up 10% to 25-plus percent. Cyber rates are generally up 10 to 20-plus percent, with increased underwriting questions and some reduction in coverage availability. Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to place. For both of these lines, we're seeing carriers reduce overall limits while seeking significant rate increases. 
In the E&S space, California and Florida personal lines continues to be the most challenging. The appetite for personal lines and cat areas will continue to be constrained through at least the end of '21. 
From an M&A perspective, we closed 2 transactions during the quarter with the annual revenues of approximately $11 million. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about the level of activity engagement with prospective sellers. 
Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered an outstanding organic growth of 17.6% for the second quarter. Performance was driven by growth across all lines of business and moves the customer segments through a combination of strong new business, good retention rate increases and higher exposure units as a result of the economic recovery. National programs grew 13.3% organically, delivering another great quarter. Our growth was driven by comp performance from most programs due to robust new business, good retention and rate increases. 
The Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered a solid quarter with 12.3% organic growth. Brokerage continues to perform very well delivering strong growth in new business and realizing continued rate increases from most lines of coverage. Binding Authority had a good quarter, driven by new business and continued economic recovery. And personal lines in California and Florida remain very difficult to place, and we don't expect carrier appetite to change in the second half of the year. 
The Services segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 4.6%, primarily driven by claims processing revenue. The growth for the quarter was partially offset by continued headwinds within the advocacy businesses, primarily the social security space. Overall, it was a very strong quarter across the board. 
Now I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss the financial performance in more detail."

Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. We're on Slide #6.

Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. We're on Slide #6. 
For the second quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $128.5 million or 21.5% and organic revenue growth of 14.7%. EBITDAC increased by 35.4%, which expanded EBITDAC margin by 340 basis points despite lower margin associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters and slightly higher travel costs. The EBITDAC growth was driven by the continued leveraging of our expense base and lower noncash stock-based compensation. 
Income before income taxes increased by 44% growing faster than EBITDAC due to a lower growth rate in amortization and interest expense, as well as a decrease in acquisition earn-out payables. Net income increased by $42.5 million or 43.9% and our diluted net income per share increased by 44.1% to $0.49. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of this year and last year was 25.2%. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate of 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. 
Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to 9.3 cents or 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2020. 
We move over to Slide #7. This represents our results after the adjustment to remove the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. For the second quarter of this year and last year, the impact was normal with the adjusted and as-reported diluted net income per share of $0.49, growing 44.1% over the prior year. 
Moving over to Slide #8. We saw the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 21.3%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 2.2%. Organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates increased by 14.7%. 
Over to Slide #9. The Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 28.3% driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 17.6% which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Organic growth for the quarter was positively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to the $8 million adjustment recorded in the second quarter of last year for the economic disruption associated with the pandemic. 
EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 510 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 55.1% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue, along with a gain on disposal associated with the sale of certain books of business. The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average, higher noncash stock-based compensation and slightly higher travel costs. Income before income tax margin increased 580 basis points, growing faster than EBITDAC driven primarily by amortization and intercompany interest expense growing at a slower rate than EBITDAC. 
Moving on to Slide #10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 14% and organic revenue by 13.3%. Regarding outlook for the last 2 quarters of 2021, we wanted to highlight that we anticipate approximately $4 million to $6 million of revenue shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due to renewal timing for certain accounts. 
EBITDAC Increased by $7.9 million or 12.6%, growing slightly slower than total revenues due to incremental costs associated with onboarding new customers increased noncash stock-based compensation and slightly higher variable costs. 
Income before income taxes increased by $18.4 million or 38%, growing faster than EBITDAC primarily due to lower estimated acquisition earn-outs payable and lower intercompany interest expense. 
Move over to Slide #11, the Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.7% driven by acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 12.3%. EBITDAC grew by 19.1% with a margin increase of 40 basis points, even with lower guaranteed supplemental commissions, slightly higher variable operating expenses and incremental noncash stock-based compensation. Income before income taxes grew by 6.9%, which was slower than total revenue growth primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
Over on Slide 12, our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 4.6%. Regarding outlook, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flat or down slightly for the second half of the year due to continued headwinds in processing claims by the Social Security Administration. 
For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 9.8%, driven primarily by leveraging organic revenue growth. Income before income taxes increased by 19.8%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to lower intercompany interest expense and amortization. 
A few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion for the quarter, we experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $466 million of cash flow from operations through the first 6 months of 2021, growing $50 million or 12% as compared to the first 6 months of 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 30.2% for 6 months -- for the first 6 months of 2021. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund continued growth. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we continue to believe the economy will improve over the coming quarters. This should drive increased confidence among business owners and how they invest in their companies. 
A few items we believe will impact the speed and trajectory of the economy are, in no particular order: one, the ability to hire workers in certain industries; two, supply chain issues that continue to constrain production and sales; three, the spread of and response to the Delta variant; and four, the impact of inflation. How these play out will influence the bumps in the road to recovery. 
At this stage, we believe there should be further economic improvement throughout the remainder of '21 and into 2022, but not at the same pace experienced in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate some moderation of our organic revenue growth during the back half of the year compared to what we delivered in the first half. 
As it relates to the underwriting process, we continue to anticipate our carrier partners to be competitive for new business and accounts for low losses. We also expect rate increases will be fairly similar to the first half of the year with maybe some moderation. 
From an M&A perspective, we believe the market will remain very active. There are a lot of companies looking to do transactions, and we feel that we are well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will continue to follow our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been the key to our long-term success in delivering shareholder value. 
We've been talking over the last few earnings calls about our technology initiatives and how these are advancing. We're very pleased with our progress, and the teams are doing a great job. Our holistic focus is to improve the experience for our customers, carrier partners and teammates. To achieve this goal, we have prioritized the following areas: optimize and enhance our utilization of data and analytics; expand our digital delivery capabilities around products and services; and engage in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underwriting processes. 
In summary, we couldn't be happier with the financial performance of the second quarter and the first half of the year. The results are just outstanding. Our team is doing an incredible job of leveraging our wide-ranging capabilities to win new customers and retain our existing customers. We are well positioned to continue delivering good profitable growth.

So I think that your assessment is correct, yes. I also think there are lots of people that are watching. There's this great desire to get out and be so-called normal again, and yet. Now people are watching the Delta variant spread very closely and how does that impact their business and/or their hiring. 
So I think that we're just trying to -- we think that the economic for the GDP and expansion in the second half of the year is going to slow down slightly. It will not be like what it was in the second quarter. It doesn't mean it's going negative, it doesn't mean anything like that. It's just -- if you look at all the stuff that we're seeing, it just moderates -- it shows a moderation in the second half of the year. We agree with that. And that's kind of how we'd answer that."

Number two, when you see certain firms are interested in acquiring or building more than others, large and upper middle market capabilities, and that could be domestically or internationally for that matter. And some firms have tried to focus on hiring teams, as you know, from large brokers and moving them over. Historically, we haven't done that. We have hired people from other firms, and we have acquired people and other organizations that had been at large firms before. And so I think those are 2 independent things. 
I do think that any time you have a shakeup in something like this combined, if you combine that with the pandemic and the ongoing issues around the pandemic, I think you have still a lot of people that are evaluating. Do I want to be part of this type of organization, whatever that is? Or, do I want something a little different? And that may create opportunity for entrepreneurial firms like ours. That's the way we look at it."

Then what happens is then they constrain the number of lawyers that they have in their reviewing cases. Those slow down over time and then they'll kind of work back out. You've probably seen the announcement that they're -- the previous director is no longer with the administration, and they're looking to put a new one in. So that will again, cost and changes up there. It is a cycle.

Our performance for the first 6 months of 2021 is due to th",898,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter '21 earnings call.
Q2 was a very strong quarter and it's the best in the history of Brown & Brown. Our performance for the first 6 months of 2021 is due to the tremendous effort of our talented 11,000-plus teammates that deliver creative risk management solutions for our customers. Each of our segments delivered impressive results with strong top and bottom line growth due to more new business, good customer retention, increased premium rates across most lines of coverage and higher exposure units driven by continued economic expansion. These results reflect the strength and diversity of our operating model as well as the power of our performance-based culture.
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter. I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $727 million of revenue, growing 21.5% in total and 14.7% organically. This is the strongest organic growth that we've ever delivered. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.
Our EBITDAC margin was 32.9%, which is up 340 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the second quarter was $0.49, increasing 44% on an as-reported and adjusted basis, with the latter excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. 
In summary, we're very pleased with our strong performance and believe we're well positioned to continue delivering best-in-class solutions for our customers. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail.
I'm on Slide 4. Let's start with the economy and what we saw during the quarter. As companies continue to reopen and strengthen, business confidence is improving. However, not all companies are back at 100%, and we continue to hear about struggles with certain customer segments in hiring workers. We think this will work itself out over the coming months and quarters, but these open roles are serving as a bit of a governor on the speed of recovery. Due to this uncertainty, customers remain very focused on their insurance spend and, therefore, managing their deductibles and aggregate limits. 
Rates were generally in line with what we experienced in the first quarter. However, we started to see some moderation to the level of increases in certain admitted and nonadmitted lines. Certain customers and industries with high losses remain a placement challenge. However, we continue to see carriers seeking higher rate increases on renewal business while quoting at or below expiring rates for new business of a similar risk profile. Admitted rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines. The outliers are workers' compensation rates, which remain down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which are up 5% to 10%. 
From an E & S perspective, most rates are up 10% to 20%. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%. However, near the end of the quarter, we started to see less upward pressure on -- less upward rate pressure on renewals.
Professional liability for most accounts remains challenging, the SPAC market in particular. Professional liability rates are generally up 10% to 25-plus percent. Cyber rates are generally up 10 to 20-plus percent with increased underwriting questions and some reduction in coverage availability. Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to place. For both of these lines, we're seeing carriers reduce overall limits while seeking significant rate increases. 
In the E & S space, California and Florida personal lines continues to be the most challenging. The appetite for personal lines and cat areas will continue to be constrained through at least the end of '21. 
From an M&A perspective, we closed 2 transactions during the quarter with the annual revenues of approximately $11 million. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about the level of activity engagement with prospective sellers.
Slide 5. Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered an outstanding organic growth of 17.6% for the second quarter. The performance was driven by growth across all lines of business and most customer segments through a combination of strong new business, good retention, rate increases and higher exposure units as a result of the economic recovery. 
National Programs grew 13.3% organically, delivering another great quarter. Our growth was driven by strong performance from most programs due to robust new business, good retention and rate increases. 
The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered a solid quarter with 12.3% organic growth. Brokerage continues to perform very well, delivering strong growth in new business and realizing continued rate increases from most lines of coverage. Binding authority had a good quarter, driven by new business and continued economic recovery. And personal lines in California and Florida remain very difficult to place, and we don't expect carrier appetite to change in the second half of the year.
The Services Segment had a good quarter and delivered organic revenue growth of 4.6%, primarily driven by claims processing revenue. Growth for the quarter was partially offset by continued headwinds within the advocacy businesses, primarily the social security space. Overall, it was a very strong quarter across the board. 
Now I'll turn it over to Andy to discuss the financial performance in more detail."

Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. We're on Slide #6.For the second quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $128.5 million, or 21.5%, an",874,"Great. Thanks, Powell. Good morning, everybody. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. We're on Slide #6.
For the second quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $128.5 million, or 21.5%, and organic revenue growth of 14.7%. EBITDAC increased by 35.4%, which expanded EBITDAC margin by 340 basis points despite lower margin associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters and slightly higher travel costs. The EBITDAC growth was driven by the continued leveraging of our expense base and lower noncash stock-based compensation. 
Income before income taxes increased by 44%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to a lower growth rate in amortization and interest expense as well as a decrease in acquisition earn-out payables. Net income increased by $42.5 million or 43.9%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 44.1% to $0.49. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of this year and last year was 25.2%. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 cents or 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
We're over on Slide #7. This slide presents our results after the adjustment to remove the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years. For the second quarter of this year and last year, the impact was minimal with the adjusted and as-reported diluted net income per share of $0.49 growing 44.1% over the prior year.
Moving over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 21.3%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 2.2%. Organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates, increased by 14.7%.
Over to Slide #9. The Retail Segment delivered total revenue growth of 28.3% driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 17.6%, which was driven by growth across all lines of business. Organic growth for the quarter was positively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to the $8 million adjustment recorded in the second quarter of last year for the economic disruption associated with the pandemic. 
EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 510 basis points, and EBITDAC grew 55.1% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue, along with a gain on disposal associated with the sale of certain books of business. The growth was partially offset by recent acquisitions that have margins lower than the average, higher noncash stock-based compensation and slightly higher travel cost. Income before income tax margin increased 580 basis points, growing faster than EBITDAC, driven primarily by amortization and intercompany interest expense growing at a slower rate than EBITDAC.
We're over on Slide #10. Our National Programs Segment increased total revenue by 14% and organic revenue by 13.3%. Regarding outlook for the last 2 quarters of 2021, we wanted to highlight that we anticipate approximately $4 million to $6 million of revenue shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due to renewal timing for certain accounts. 
EBITDAC Increased by $7.9 million or 12.6%, growing slightly slower than total revenues due to incremental costs associated with onboarding new customers, increased noncash stock-based compensation and slightly higher variable costs. Income before income taxes increased by $18.4 million or 38%, growing faster than EBITDAC, primarily due to lower estimated acquisition earn-outs payable and lower intercompany interest expense.
Over to Slide #11. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.7% driven by acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 12.3%. EBITDAC grew by 19.1% with a margin increase of 40 basis points, even with lower guaranteed supplemental commissions, slightly higher variable operating expenses and incremental noncash stock-based compensation. Income before income taxes grew by 6.9%, which was slower than total revenue growth primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense and the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
Over on Slide 12. Our Services Segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 4.6%. Regarding outlook, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flat or down slightly for the second half of the year due to continued headwinds in processing claims by the Social Security Administration.
For the quarter, EBITDAC grew by 9.8%, driven primarily by leveraging organic revenue growth. Income before income taxes increased by 19.8%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to lower intercompany interest expense and amortization. 
A few comments regarding liquidity and cash conversion for the quarter. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $466 million of cash flow from operations through the first 6 months of 2021, growing $50 million or 12% as compared to the first 6 months of 2020. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 30.2% for 6 months -- for the first 6 months of 2021. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund continued growth.
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

From an economic standpoint, we continue to believe the economy will improve over the coming quarters. This should drive increased confidence among business owners and how they invest in their companies.
A few items we believe will impact the speed and trajectory of the economy are, in no particular order: one, the ability to hire workers in certain industries; two, supply chain issues that continue to constrain production and sales; three, the spread of and response to the Delta variant; and four, the impact of inflation. How these play out will influence the bumps in the road to recovery.
At this stage, we believe there should be further economic improvement throughout the remainder of '21 and into 2022, but not at the same pace experienced in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate some moderation of our organic revenue growth during the back half of the year compared to what we delivered in the first half. 
As it relates to the underwriting process, we continue to anticipate our carrier partners to be competitive for new business and accounts with low losses. We also expect rate increases will be fairly similar to the first half of the year with maybe some moderation.
From an M&A perspective, we believe the market will remain very active. There are a lot of companies looking to do transactions, and we feel that we are well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will continue to follow our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been the key to our long-term success in delivering shareholder value.
We've been talking over the last few earnings calls about our technology initiatives and how these are advancing. We're very pleased with our progress, and the teams are doing a great job. Our holistic focus is to improve the experience for our customers, carrier partners and teammates. To achieve this goal, we have prioritized the following areas: optimize and enhance our utilization of data and analytics; expand our digital delivery capabilities around products and services; and engage in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underwriting processes.
In summary, we couldn't be happier with the financial performance of the second quarter and the first half of the year. The results are just outstanding. Our team is doing an incredible job of leveraging our wide-ranging capabilities to win new customers and retain our existing customers. We are well positioned to continue delivering good, profitable growth.

And maybe the have and have-nots is being shifted more so because of things like headwinds in hiring or supply chain issues as opposed to business confidence. I guess is that a fair characterization that we have this shift? And how should we think about this with the framework that you talked about moderation of organic in the back half of the year?"

I think your statement, Phil, is true in kind of just at face value. The challenge with that is those people that experienced the toughest time during the downturn are going to have the longest memories relative to the go-forward and their confidence and thought process in reinvesting in their business. 
So I think that your assessment is correct, yes. I also think there are lots of people that are watching. There's this great desire to get out and be so-called normal again. And yet, now people are watching the Delta variant spread very closely and how does that impact their business and/or their hiring. 
So I think that we're just trying to -- we think that the economic for the GDP and expansion in the second half of the year is going to slow down slightly. It will not be like what it was in the second quarter. Doesn't mean it's going negative. Doesn't mean anything like that. It's just -- if you look at all the stuff that we're seeing, it just moderates -- it shows a moderation in the second half of the year. We agree with that, and that's kind of how we'd answer that."

So my first comment was specifically directed at commercial properties, not individual homeowners. So what I'm saying is, is we're seeing a slight tapering of the rate increases that we saw in the late part of the second quarter. 
The comment about California and Florida is personal lines, that homeowners, and particularly certain segments of those personal lines markets. So they can be older homes, they could be lower-value homes, they could be frame construction homes. In the California case, it could be anything in a brushfire area, all of those type of things. 
So what I would say is when you see that range, Mark, there could be a slight wiggle in the range be it either the bottom or the top end. Don't read too much into that in terms of -- we just kind of want you to know where the vast majority of those renewals are coming in. 
And the point being is as we got down towards the end of June, we started to see some renewals with slightly less rate pressure. Did not mean it wasn't up, but those are on commercial buildings. It could include a condo. I mean that's habitational, but not a stand-alone home like if you had a home in Fort Lauderdale or a home in Miami or wherever."

Number two, when you see certain firms are interested in acquiring or building more than others, large and upper-middle market capabilities -- and that could be domestically or internationally for that matter. And some firms have tried to focus on hiring teams, as you know, from large brokers and moving them over. Historically, we haven't done that. We have hired people from other firms, and we have acquired people and other organizations that had been at large firms before. And so I think those are 2 independent things.
I do think that any time you have a shakeup in something like this combined -- if you combine that with the pandemic and the ongoing issues around the pandemic, I think you have still a lot of people that are evaluating, do I want to be part of this type of organization, whatever that is? Or do I want something a little different? And that may create opportunity for entrepreneurial firms like ours. That's the way we look at it."

Then what happens is then they constrain the number of lawyers that they have in their reviewing cases. Those slow down over time and then it'll kind of work back out. You've probably seen the announcement that their -- the previous director is no longer with the administration, and they're looking to put a new one in. So that will again, cost and changes up there. It is a cycle. We'll kind of work through it, and then hopefully, the amount that we've been submitting in there will get processed over the coming year. 
It does take a while. It just doesn't turn back on like a faucet overnight. We've got really good inflow into the business. We just can't get the output from SSA. And that's where we anticipate headwind at least for the back end of the year. And then we'll have a view as to what it looks like for '22 when we get some more road covered."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Q3 was another very good quarter for Brown & Brown. This was a result of our nearly 12,000 teammates delivering creative risk management solutions for our customers. We delivered strong top line growth driven by a combination -- by the combination of robust new business, good retention, rate increases and some expansion of exposure units. At the same time, our team continued to drive profitable growth, resulting in impressive margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share expansion. We're also very proud that last week, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of 10.8% in our quarterly dividend. Of note, we've now increased our dividend for the 28th year in a row.
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter, I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $770 million of revenue, growing 14.3% in total and 8.5% organically. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin grew by 280 basis points to 35.6% versus the third quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the third quarter was $0.52 on an as-reported basis and $0.58, excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we completed another 7 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter.
In summary, we're really pleased with our strong performance for the third quarter and the first 9 months as the year-to-date results are the best in our history, 10.8% internal growth year-to-date. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail.
I'm now on Slide 4. We have customers that have done well throughout the pandemic and others that are struggling to fully reopen, mainly due to the inability to hire employees. We are seeing this challenge in a number of industries and geographies. And as a consequence, restricting how fast companies can become fully operational. In addition to shortages of workers, supply chain issues and inflation are putting pressure on costs. From a placement standpoint, the themes are pretty consistent. Customers with good loss experience are getting the best rates and coverage while those with tough loss experience are seeing material rate increases or reductions in available limits or both. As a result, customers continue to consider program modifications to manage their premium increases. Rate increases remain relatively consistent with prior quarters. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 8% across most lines. The outliers are workers' compensation rates, which are down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which are up 5% to 10%.
From an E&S perspective, most rates were up 10% to 20% with some outliers. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 10% to 30% with this being a slightly broader range than we saw in the previous quarter. Professional liability for most accounts remain very challenging with rates up 10- to 15-plus percent. Cyber rates, in some instances, could increase dramatically depending on the security in place with the customer. Security protocols that were viewed as nice to have in the past are now viewed as a minimum expectations to obtain coverage. Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to place. For professional liability, cyber and umbrella, we're seeing carriers reduce limits while seeking significant rate increases. Florida and California placements in E&S for personal lines remain the most challenging due to losses or aggregate concentrations. We expect the appetite for personal lines and cat areas to continue to be constrained in 2022, which will likely put pressure on state-sponsored programs and the cost of insurance for the consumer. From an M&A perspective, we were successful in closing 7 transactions during the quarter with annual revenues of approximately $21 million. We've closed a total of 11 deals year-to-date with annual revenues of $65 million, and I've already announced a couple of additional acquisitions in October. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about our level of activity and engagement with prospective sellers on Slide #5.
Let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered great results with organic revenue growth of 8.3% for the third quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of strong new business good retention, rate increases and exposure unit expansion. We're leveraging our broad capabilities to benefit our customers and prospects. National Programs delivered another outstanding quarter, growing 13.2% organically. Our growth was driven by the strong performance from most programs due to new business, good retention and rate increases. The Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered a 5.1% organic growth with commercial brokerage and binding performing well, driven by new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage. Personal Lines and coastal states continues to be a headwind, as I mentioned earlier. The Services segment delivered organic revenue growth of 0.5%. The performance for the quarter was driven by claims processing revenue associated with recent weather events, which was substantially offset by external factors continuing to impact our advocacy businesses. Overall, it was a great quarter across the board.
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

We're over on Slide #6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the third quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $96.3 million or 14.3%",807,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on Slide #6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the third quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $96.3 million or 14.3% and organic revenue growth of 8.5%. Income before income taxes and EBITDAC both increased by approximately 24%. EBITDAC margins expanded 280 basis points driven by strong organic revenue growth and managing our expenses. Net income increased by $12.4 million or 9.3%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 10.6% to $0.52. The effective tax rate increased to 25.5% for the third quarter of this year as compared to 15.5% in the third quarter of last year. The tax rate for the current quarter is in line with previous guidance while the prior year was driven by the tax benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 and or 9.4% compared to the third quarter 2020.
We're over on Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years, which we believe presents a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. The change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a charge of $23.1 million in the third quarter of this year compared to $15.3 million for the same period last year. Excluding these noncash items, income before income taxes on an adjusted basis increased by 26.4%. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $16.7 million or 11.4%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.58, increasing 11.5%. The lower growth of earnings per share and net income for the quarter as compared to the growth of income before income taxes was driven by the change in the effective tax rate. Overall, it was a very strong quarter on the top and bottom line.
I'm going to move over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter,  our total commissions and fees increased by 14.6%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 27.1% as we qualify for certain additional contingents and GSCs this year. Organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates increased by 8.5%.
Forward to Slide #9. The Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.8%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 8.3% with solid growth across all lines of business. EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 180 basis points and EBITDAC grew 24.6% due to higher organic revenue growth, increased contingent commissions and GSCs and and managing our expenses even with slightly higher variable cost. The growth in income before income tax as compared to EBITDAC for all segments is impacted by changes in intercompany interest, amortization, depreciation and estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
Over to Slide #10. Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 13.7% and organic revenue by 13.2%. In conjunction with the onboarding of a new customer, we recognized approximately $5 million of incremental revenue this quarter that represents timing. We expect the incremental revenue from this customer to more than likely be recognized within the first half of 2022. EBITDAC increased by $18.7 million or 28.5% with the margin improving 510 basis points as a result of strong organic revenue growth, managing our expenses and the positive impact of the nonrecurring write-off of certain receivables that occurred in the third quarter of last year.
Over to Slide #11. The Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 11.2% driven by acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 5.1%. EBITDAC grew 4.7%, but the growth was impacted by incremental broker compensation driven by higher levels of performance, slightly higher variable costs and certain nonrecurring intercompany IT charges.
On Slide 12. Our Services segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 0.5% with EBITDAC growing 6.8%, driven by continued management of our expenses.
Few comments regarding cash conversion and liquidity. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $628 million of cash flow from operations through the first 9 months of this year, growing $88 million or 16% as compared to the first 9 months of last year. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 27% for the first 9 months of this year. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund continued investments in our business.
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

We've had an outstanding first 9 months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue profitable growth. As we look towards the remainder of the year and into '22, we expect business confidence to improve and exposure units to expand. The main influencers of increased confidence and business expansion will be: one, the availability of employees across all industries; two, the resolution of supply chain constraints; three, inflation. Is it transitory, or is it sustained? And four, the continued management of COVID. How and when these play out over the coming quarters will influence the trajectory of the economy. From an underwriting perspective, we anticipate premium increases will continue to moderate for many lines with the exception of cyber, professional, excess and automobile. The M&A market will continue to be very active and valuations will remain at heightened levels as a result of many buyers with a lot of available capital. We feel that we're well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will continue with our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been key to our long-term success of delivering shareholder value. From an innovation standpoint, our focus is to constantly and consistently deliver creative solutions for the benefit of our customers, prospects and teammates. We're making good progress and are continuing to align on common operating platforms for each division, enhancing our customer-facing applications to make it easier to do business with Brown & Brown and leveraging our data to the benefit of our customers.
In summary, the results were outstanding for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, and we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this ever-changing marketplace.
With that, let me turn it back over to Cecilia for the Q&A session."

And so I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to give you an answer to your question specifically. But I can tell you, it is interesting because most of the people we talk to have a pretty positive outlook on the future. It's just that their cost of goods sold or services sold or whatever, is going up, and they don't know to how much. So it's conceivable they will sell more of their product, whatever that is, but have a slightly lower margin next year."

And so I would say that we will constantly and consistently, whether it's now or 3 years ago or 3 years from now, are evaluating how we compensate our teammates, how we reward people, what that means in terms of long-term alignment with what we're trying to build. And I think the other thing that people sometimes confused the issue is, it is not linear hiring necessarily. And so it's not like you can say, well, we're going to hire 3 people and 1 person retired. We're going to hire 3 people. It's not like that. It's one of these things where we want the best athletes on the field. So it's conceivable that next year, we hire a lot more people in certain segments of our business, either to service our customers or to produce new business or some combination thereof. So I look at it as our investment in salary and related is not just increasing cost on existing teammates. It's actually building in and compensating for new hires that are not in our current budget that are so talented that we can't afford not to hire them."

I would just tell you that we feel really good about how we bring people into the organization, how we continue to train and enhance our capabilities to deliver for our customers, and how we launch people to taking on more responsibility, whether it be in a leadership role in an existing office or in a different office. So I think of this as it is a busy time in terms of talent any -- for any business, anybody, and we're no different.

Number two, and I know you know this, but remember, our business is slightly more binding authority than brokerage. And some of the other firms that you would have transparency into are usually the reverse. So there are more brokerage than binding. And then on top of that, as I said, we have a component of that binding authority business, which is personal lines, which is being dramatically impacted in California and Florida. In California, as you can tell, it's not just losses but it's actually people trying to get off of policies and the insurance commission are not letting them in certain areas. And in Florida, it's a people being non-renewed in some instances, by standard markets and having to flow into Citizens. So what you've got is you've got 2 environments, where it's -- I don't even know if I'd say transitory because that's not the right term, it's a -- there are 2 personal lines markets that are huge that are influx.

No, you keep on the $4 million to $6 million -- just keep in mind on that one, the way that we were suggesting to everybody is, once you had your estimate for the third and fourth quarter, then you probably wanted to move $4 million to $6 million. What you don't want to do now is now take $4 million to $6 million out of the third quarter and move it to the fourth. So that would be incorrect."

So generally speaking, clients are not focused on profitability of insurance companies. So that's the first thing. The second thing that is important is depending on the conversation, there are sometimes discussions around loss cost increases where your losses are going up 5%, 6%, 7%, meaning the cost of the same loss year-over-year would be higher by, let's say, 7%. And what's happening now, if you listen to the carriers, as they're talking about these very significant verdicts sometimes that would seem that would be outside the normal. I don't like the term, but it's a nuclear verdict or something like that. And you start to see some of these where the settlement might be X and then all of a sudden, it's 15 X, you expect. And so the short answer to the question is the customer is not generally focused on or dialed into the performance of the insurance company. What she or he is focused on is, one, controlling their cost; two, making sure they have the best cut, not in this order, coverage is the best coverage they can get; and three, to the extent possible flexibility and options. Flexibility and options might be program designed. So when you put all those together, that's kind of the course of the conversation. And in certain segments of the marketplace, as you may know, there are limited options, and so therefore, there might be more pricing pressure there than it would be on something that every insurance company really wants to write. So therein lies the conundrum when we talk with our customers, but the key to that is making sure there's -- to the extent possible, there's no real surprises. So talking to our customers early and often about what we see in the marketplace, and how we come up with ideas to manage the process and their costs and coverage going forward."

As a broad statement, I'm not aware of anything that is so new and different that it's earth shattering. However, you're starting to hear more and more, Michael, about the interest of people to write more private flood. And that's great, but the private flood, they don't want to really write in the worst flood zones. So it's sort of like writing wind on a AAA construction building, where you have a low probability of loss, lots of carriers would like that, but sometimes they aren't willing to price it that way. What we're seeing is we're not seeing -- we're not -- I'm not aware of a program that can model flood with any great statistical relevance and therein lies the challenge. So you know that we're going to risk rating 2.0 with NFIP. You have discussions around looking at flood maps and are they appropriate. You have all kinds of things going on, and there's a lot of discussion around, hey, this is a growth opportunity. And yet, the private flood market is not writing an enormous amount of the segments that NFIP serves. So long-winded answer, but I'm not aware of anything that's dramatically impacting the industry, but we're always trying to; one, be creative and; two, plugged in to what's going on in Washington as it impacts our business and our ability to service a broader customer base."

Because people -- our definition of EBITDA or EBITDAC is different than other people. And so what we might believe is a recurring expense they might try to take out. And so I would just -- I've kind of changed the way I refer to it, which basically says valuations continue to be high as I said in the remarks, which is, it continues to be at the very high end of the range. And I don't see that changing in the near to intermediate term, that's number one. Number two, as we've talked about before, we bought a business in January, as you know, of 2020, called special risk. It's in Vancouver, British Columbia, and we do business across Canada. It's a wholesale operation with a bunch of great teammates, and we're very pleased about that. And then we also bought in the beginning of this year, Alere insurances in Ireland, based in Cork, which we're equally as pleased about. And so if you think about those 2 areas, and our business in London, those are areas where there's a rule of law. There is something that we typically do business or have done and can do business there currently. And we're always looking for opportunities that fit culturally and make sense financially. So lots of -- not you, Greg, but lots of investment people think that sounds sexy. And I don't think that international expansion is sexy I think it is -- I don't sleep on airplanes, and it's not about me, but it's hard to do that when I fly to London, and I've got 3 hours of sleep, I'm going to a meeting. So I say all that, trying to be a little tongue and cheek, but we look to partner with people that we think fit culturally makes sense financially, and we're really -- we think that there are some opportunities, but the question ultimately will be, can we make those work financially as well."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Q3 was another very good quarter for Brown & Brown. This was a result of our nearly 12,000 teammates delivering creative risk management solutions for our customers. We delivered strong top line growth driven by a combination -- by the combination of robust new business, good retention, rate increases and some expansion of exposure units. At the same time, our team continued to drive profitable growth, resulting in impressive margin improvement and adjusted earnings per share expansion. We're also very proud that last week, our Board of Directors authorized an increase of 10.8% in our quarterly dividend. Of note, we've now increased our dividend for the 28th year in a row. 
Now let's transition to the results for the quarter, I'm on Slide 3. We delivered $770 million of revenue, growing 14.3% in total and 8.5% organically. I'll get into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments. Our EBITDAC margin grew by 280 basis points to 35.6% versus the third quarter of 2020. Our net income per share for the third quarter was $0.52 on an as-reported basis and $0.58, excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. During the quarter, we completed another 7 acquisitions and would like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new teammates that joined during the quarter. 
In summary, we're really pleased with our strong performance for the third quarter and the first 9 months as the year-to-date results are the best in our history, 10.8% internal growth year-to-date. Later in the presentation, Andy will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
I'm now on Slide 4. We have customers that have done well throughout the pandemic and others that are struggling to fully reopen, mainly due to the inability to hire employees. We are seeing this challenge in a number of industries and geographies. And as a consequence, restricting how fast companies can become fully operational. In addition to shortages of workers, supply chain issues and inflation are putting pressure on costs. From a placement standpoint, the themes are pretty consistent. Customers with good loss experience are getting the best rates and coverage while those with tough loss experience are seeing material rate increases or reductions in available limits or both. As a result, customers continue to consider program modifications to manage their premium increases. Rate increases remain relatively consistent with prior quarters. Admitted market rates continue to be up 3% to 8% across most lines. The outliers are workers' compensation rates, which are down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates, which are up 5% to 10%. 
From an E & S perspective, most rates were up 10% to 20% with some outliers. Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 10% to 30% with this being a slightly broader range than we saw in the previous quarter. Professional liability for most accounts remain very challenging with rates up 10% to 15-plus percent. Cyber rates, in some instances, could increase dramatically depending on the security in place with the customer. Security protocols that were viewed as nice to have in the past are now viewed as a minimum expectations to obtain coverage. Also, excess umbrella coverage remains very difficult to place. For professional liability, cyber and umbrella, we're seeing carriers reduce limits while seeking significant rate increases. Florida and California placements in E & S for personal lines remain the most challenging due to losses or aggregate concentrations. We expect the appetite for personal lines and cat areas to continue to be constrained in 2022, which will likely put pressure on state-sponsored programs and the cost of insurance for the consumer. From an M&A perspective, we were successful in closing 7 transactions during the quarter with annual revenues of approximately $21 million. We've closed a total of 11 deals year-to-date with annual revenues of $65 million, and I've already announced a couple of additional acquisitions in October. Our pipeline remains full, and we feel good about our level of activity and engagement with prospective sellers. 
On Slide #5. let's discuss the performance of our 4 segments. Retail delivered great results with organic revenue growth of 8.3% for the third quarter. The performance was driven by growth from all lines of business through a combination of strong new business, good retention, rate increases and exposure unit expansion. We're leveraging our broad capabilities to benefit our customers and prospects. National Programs delivered another outstanding quarter, growing 13.2% organically. Our growth was driven by the strong performance from most programs due to new business, good retention and rate increases. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered a 5.1% organic growth with commercial brokerage and binding performing well, driven by new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage. Personal lines and coastal states continues to be a headwind, as I mentioned earlier. The Services Segment delivered organic revenue growth of 0.5%. The performance for the quarter was driven by claims processing revenue associated with recent weather events, which was substantially offset by external factors continuing to impact our advocacy businesses. Overall, it was a great quarter across the board. 
Now let me turn it over to Andy to discuss our financial performance in more detail."

We're over on Slide #6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the third quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $96.3 million or 14.3%",806,"Great. Thank you, Powell. Good morning, everybody. We're over on Slide #6. Like previous quarters, we'll discuss our GAAP results and certain non-GAAP financial highlights. For the third quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $96.3 million or 14.3% and organic revenue growth of 8.5%. Income before income taxes and EBITDAC both increased by approximately 24%. EBITDAC margins expanded 280 basis points driven by strong organic revenue growth and managing our expenses. Net income increased by $12.4 million or 9.3%, and our diluted net income per share increased by 10.6% to $0.52. The effective tax rate increased to 25.5% for the third quarter of this year as compared to 15.5% in the third quarter of last year. The tax rate for the current quarter is in line with previous guidance while the prior year was driven by the tax benefit associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards. We continue to anticipate our full year effective tax rate for 2021 will be in the 23% to 24% range. Our weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year, and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 and or 9.4% compared to the third quarter 2020. 
We're over on Slide #7. This slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years, which we believe presents a more meaningful year-over-year comparison. The change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a charge of $23.1 million in the third quarter of this year compared to $15.3 million for the same period last year. Excluding these noncash items, income before income taxes on an adjusted basis increased by 26.4%. Our net income on an adjusted basis increased by $16.7 million or 11.4%, and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.58, increasing 11.5%. The lower growth of earnings per share and net income for the quarter as compared to the growth of income before income taxes was driven by the change in the effective tax rate. Overall, it was a very strong quarter on the top and bottom line. 
I'm going to move over to Slide #8. This slide presents the key components of our revenue performance. For the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 14.6%, and our contingent commissions and GSCs increased by 27.1% as we qualify for certain additional contingents and GSCs this year. Organic revenue, which excludes the net impact of M&A activity and changes in foreign exchange rates increased by 8.5%. 
Over to Slide #9. The Retail Segment delivered total revenue growth of 17.8%, driven by acquisition activity over the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 8.3% with solid growth across all lines of business. EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 180 basis points and EBITDAC grew 24.6% due to higher organic revenue growth, increased contingent commissions and GSCs and managing our expenses even with slightly higher variable cost. The growth in income before income tax as compared to EBITDAC for all segments is impacted by changes in intercompany interest, amortization, depreciation and estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
Over to Slide #10. Our National Programs Segment increased total revenue by 13.7% and organic revenue by 13.2%. In conjunction with the onboarding of a new customer, we recognized approximately $5 million of incremental revenue this quarter that represents timing. We expect the incremental revenue from this customer to more than likely be recognized within the first half of 2022. EBITDAC increased by $18.7 million or 28.5% with the margin improving 510 basis points as a result of strong organic revenue growth, managing our expenses and the positive impact of the nonrecurring write-off of certain receivables that occurred in the third quarter of last year. 
Over to Slide #11. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment delivered total revenue growth of 11.2% driven by acquisitions in the past 12 months and organic revenue growth of 5.1%. EBITDAC grew 4.7%, but the growth was impacted by incremental broker compensation driven by higher levels of performance, slightly higher variable cost and certain nonrecurring intercompany IT charges. 
On Slide 12. Our Services Segment increased total revenue and organic revenue by 0.5% with EBITDAC growing 6.8%, driven by continued management of our expenses. 
Few comments regarding cash conversion and liquidity. We experienced another strong quarter of cash flow generation and have delivered $628 million of cash flow from operations through the first 9 months of this year, growing $88 million or 16% as compared to the first 9 months of last year. Our ratio of cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue remained strong at 27% for the first 9 months of this year. With the combination of our cash generation and capital availability, we are well positioned to fund continued investments in our business. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments."

We've had an outstanding first 9 months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue profitable growth. As we look towards the remainder of the year and into '22, we expect business confidence to improve and exposure units to expand. The main influencers of increased confidence and business expansion will be: One, the availability of employees across all industries; two, the resolution of supply chain constraints; three, inflation. Is it transitory, or is it sustained? And four, the continued management of COVID. How and when these play out over the coming quarters will influence the trajectory of the economy. From an underwriting perspective, we anticipate premium increases will continue to moderate for many lines with the exception of cyber, professional excess and automobile. The M&A market will continue to be very active and valuations will remain at a heightened levels as a result of many buyers with a lot of available capital. We feel that we're well positioned with a good pipeline to attract great companies to join the Brown & Brown team. We will continue with our disciplined approach of focusing on culture and financial alignment as these have been key to our long-term success of delivering shareholder value. From an innovation standpoint, our focus is to constantly and consistently deliver creative solutions for the benefit of our customers, prospects and teammates. We're making good progress and are continuing to align on common operating platforms for each division, enhancing our customer-facing applications to make it easier to do business with Brown & Brown and leveraging our data to the benefit of our customers. 
In summary, the results were outstanding for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, and we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this ever-changing marketplace. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Cecilia for the Q&A session."

And so I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to give you an answer to your question specifically. But I can tell you, it is interesting because most of the people we talk to have a pretty positive outlook on the future. It's just that their cost of goods sold or services sold or whatever, is going up, and they don't know to how much. So it's conceivable they will sell more of their product, whatever that is, but have a slightly lower margin next year."

And so I would say that we will constantly and consistently, whether it's now or 3 years ago or 3 years from now, are evaluating how we compensate our teammates, how we reward people, what that means in terms of long-term alignment with what we're trying to build. And I think the other thing that people sometimes confused the issue is, it is not linear hiring necessarily. And so it's not like you can say, well, we're going to hire 3 people and 1 person retire. We're going to hire 3 people. It's not like that. It's one of these things where we want the best athletes on the field. So it's conceivable that next year, we hire a lot more people in certain segments of our business, either to service our customers or to produce new business or some combination thereof. So I look at it as our investment in salary and related is not just increasing cost on existing teammates. It's actually building in and compensating for new hires that are not in our current budget that are so talented that we can't afford not to hire them."

But we -- as you saw that what we did last year and what we've done this year is we're trying to focus the best we can on how do we deliver profitable growth. That will move up and down over time based upon how our costs move back and forth inside of the organization. But we probably at least manage everybody's expectation. We've had a great 2021 already.

That does not mean that we don't have people trying to call our people and trying to spirit them away. But our retention levels are at historic levels. That's number one.

So remember, the business year-to-date is growing 8%, and we're very pleased with how wholesale is doing year-to-date, number one. Number two, and I know you know this, but remember, our business is slightly more binding authority than brokerage. And some of the other firms that you would have transparency into are usually the reverse. So there are more brokerage than binding. And then on top of that, as I said, we have a component of that binding authority business, which is personal lines, which is being dramatically impacted in California and Florida. In California, as you can tell, it's not just losses, but it's actually people trying to get off of policies and the insurance commission are not letting them in certain areas. And in Florida, it's a people being non-renewed in some instances, by standard markets and having to flow into Citizens. So what you've got is you've got 2 environments, where it's -- I don't even know if I'd say transitory because that's not the right term, it's a -- there are 2 personal lines markets that are huge that are influx. And so that has created a headwind for us. And so that's what I can tell you about it. But that is what I would pretty much put that on."

So generally speaking, clients are not focused on profitability of insurance companies. So that's the first thing. The second thing that is important is depending on the conversation, there are sometimes discussions around loss cost increases where your losses are going up 5%, 6%, 7%, meaning the cost of the same loss year-over-year would be higher by, let's say, 7%. And what's happening now, if you listen to the carriers, as they're talking about these very significant verdicts sometimes that would seem that would be outside the normal. I don't like the term, but it's a nuclear verdict or something like that. And you start to see some of these where the settlement might be X and then all of a sudden, it's 15x, you'd expect. And so the short answer to the question is the customer is not generally focused on or dialed into the performance of the insurance company. What she or he is focused on is, one, controlling their cost; two, making sure they have the best cut, not in this order, coverage is the best coverage they can get; and three, to the extent possible flexibility and options. Flexibility and options might be program designed. So when you put all those together, that's kind of the course of the conversation. And in certain segments of the marketplace, as you may know, there are limited options, and so therefore, there might be more pricing pressure there than it would be on something that every insurance company really wants to write. So therein lies the conundrum when we talk with our customers, but the key to that is making sure there's -- to the extent possible, there's no real surprises. So talking to our customers early and often about what we see in the marketplace, and how we come up with ideas to manage the process and their costs and coverage going forward."

Another quarter of pretty severe weather again and again and again, and this time includes lots of flood losses, which are even occurring today. So I guess in your Services Segment, are you seeing any change in I guess, the competitive environment there for others that want to kind of do what you do in that space given the kind of on slide and continuation of frequency of flooding?"

As a broad statement, I'm not aware of anything that is so new and different that it's earth shattering. However, you're starting to hear more and more, Michael, about the interest of people to write more private flood. And that's great, but the private flood, they don't want to really write in the worst flood zones. So it's sort of like writing wind on a AAA construction building, where you have a low probability of loss, lots of carriers would like that, but sometimes they aren't willing to price it that way. What we're seeing is we're not seeing -- we're not -- I'm not aware of a program that can model flood with any great statistical relevance and therein lies the challenge. So you know that we're going to risk rating 2.0 with NFIP. You have discussions around looking at flood maps and are they appropriate. You have all kinds of things going on, and there's a lot of discussion around, hey, this is a growth opportunity. And yet, the private flood market is not writing an enormous amount of the segments that NFIP serves. So long-winded answer, but I'm not aware of anything that's dramatically impacting the industry, but we're always trying to; one, be creative and; two, plugged in to what's going on in Washington as it impacts our business and our ability to service a broader customer base."

Because people -- our definition of EBITDA or EBITDAC is different than other people. And so what we might believe is a recurring expense they might try to take out. And so I would just -- I've kind of changed the way I refer to it, which basically says valuations continue to be high as I said in the remarks, which is, it continues to be at the very high end of the range. And I don't see that changing in the near to intermediate term, that's number one. Number two, as we've talked about before, we bought a business in January, as you know, of 2020, called Special Risk. It's in Vancouver, British Columbia, and we do business across Canada. It's a wholesale operation with a bunch of great teammates, and we're very pleased about that. And then we also bought in the beginning of this year, O'Leary Insurances in Ireland, based in Cork, which we're equally as pleased about. And so if you think about those 2 areas, and our business in London, those are areas where there's a rule of law. There is something that we typically do business or have done and can do business there currently. And we're always looking for opportunities that fit culturally and make sense financially. So lots of -- not you, Greg, but lots of investment people think that sounds sexy. And I don't think that international expansion is sexy, I think it is -- I don't sleep on airplanes, and it's not about me, but it's hard to do that when I fly to London, and I've got 3 hours of sleep, I'm going to a meeting. So I say all that, trying to be a little tongue and cheek, but we look to partner with people that we think fit culturally and make sense financially, and we're really -- we think that there are some opportunities, but the question ultimately will be, can we make those work financially as well."

The other is the margins that we deliver as an organization, those 2 in combination. And if you look back to how our margins have moved over the last few years, that's what pulls up in kind of that at least 27% on a year-to-date range. It will probably maybe move by a few points back-and-forth, up and down a little bit, but I wouldn't anticipate anything going down in the low 20s or anything of that nature. We are very, very focused on making sure that we can grow our revenues into cash so that ultimately, we can take that cash and invest it back into our business."
