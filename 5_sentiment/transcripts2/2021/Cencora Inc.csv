AmerisourceBergen has had a strong start to our fiscal '21 year. We delivered exceptional results driven by our differentiated commercial solutions with revenues of $52.5 billion for the first",1812,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on the call. AmerisourceBergen has had a strong start to our fiscal '21 year. We delivered exceptional results driven by our differentiated commercial solutions with revenues of $52.5 billion for the first fiscal quarter, representing growth of 10% year-over-year, and our adjusted EPS increasing 24% versus the prior year quarter. 
Building upon our business resilience, our teams executed and leveraged our capabilities to create value throughout the supply chain. Our purpose-driven culture continues to empower our associates to think, plan and act decisively to support all of our partners and to facilitate patient access to critical medical treatments. 
In addition to these results, as we announced in January, we entered into a strategic transaction with Walgreens Boots Alliance to acquire the majority of its Alliance Healthcare business and extend and expand our existing distribution agreement. As we have said, these agreements are part of the next evolution of enhancing AmerisourceBergen's ability to deliver innovative solutions for our partners, further building on our platform to deliver key distribution capabilities and value-added services to support patient access in new geographies. 
AmerisourceBergen's ongoing focus on patient access means providing innovative services and solutions to support our manufacturer partners and provide customers with our differentiated value proposition. World Courier, for example, is highly sought after for its expertise in helping manufacturing partners navigate complexities on a global scale. During the pandemic, World Courier's proven track record as an international leader in specialty logistics have enabled us to support our customers worldwide against a backdrop of changing local restrictions, limited air traffic and additional operational challenges. We have been able to facilitate direct-to-patient services in global clinical trials at a time when both demand and complexity of these services was understandably at its peak. 
Similarly, we continue to support patient access to vital treatment for COVID-19. Thanks to our robust suite of specialty distribution capabilities and our deep industry expertise, we are uniquely positioned to support our public and private partners. And AmerisourceBergen is both honored and proud to be able to be part of the solution to help them preserve public health. 
In the U.S., we continue to be the distributor of antiviral and antibody therapies, which are playing an increasingly important role as more and more hospitalized patients are receiving these treatments to help them recover from COVID-19. In Canada, our Innomar business is partnering with FedEx as the primary distributor for the COVID vaccine. Our team in Innomar is safely and securely storing the vaccines in its storage facilities across Canada and packaging them to support the temperature requirements specified by the manufacturer. 
AmerisourceBergen's scale and expertise in specialty as well as our culture of delivering collaborative and innovative solutions enable this important work. We have spent years building on and enhancing our leadership in specialty distribution. This continued investment in and focus on an important part of the pharmaceutical market continues to benefit both AmerisourceBergen and our partners. 
And over the last several months, the ability of our sourcing and commercial teams to leverage our expertise and data and analytics capability is foundational to our ability to play an important role in providing the specialty distribution solutions for COVID-related treatments. We deliver a clear and differentiated value proposition for our partners in the U.S. health care system and continue to focus on building on our strengths in specialty distribution as those capabilities continue to be even more important to all our customers. 
AmerisourceBergen's strong portfolio of customers is another important differentiator for us as it is an important driver of growth across our businesses. Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has made it a priority to have long-term strategic relationships with manufacturers and providers that embrace and appreciate collaboration. 
As we announced last month, we have agreed to strengthen our strategic partnership with Walgreens by extending and expanding our commercial agreements. This extended and expanded partnership in the U.S. will allow us to create incremental growth and efficiency opportunities, enabling each of our enterprises to better serve our respective customers. Teams from both our companies have already identified new opportunities for enhanced growth and efficiency in the areas of logistics, transportation and distribution. As we continue to realize improved capabilities derived from this partnership, these initiatives will enhance our ability to create differentiated value for all of AmerisourceBergen's customers. 
One customer group for whom we have consistently created new incremental value is our independent pharmacy customers, including our more than 5,000 Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Provider Network members. These independent pharmacies provide critical care for their communities, and their fearlessness and adaptability as entrepreneurs have enabled them to rise to the changes of the pandemic. 
We are proud to have been able to support them with the tools they have needed to connect with their patients and keep them healthy. We look forward to working as a medical administrator on behalf of qualified and eligible pharmacy network partners to support vaccination efforts in their communities when we enter the broader inoculation phase here in the United States. 
In the Animal Health segment, our MWI business has moved swiftly to deliver innovative solutions to help our customers succeed in the current environment. These include ensuring that MWI associates are accessible to our customers 24/7 and bolstering our customers' abilities to offer virtual services to their pet care clients, including innovative client communication solutions and home delivery services of quality medications and pet care products. 
AmerisourceBergen's long-term focus on strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty distribution and manufacturer services and our continued ability to support innovation and solidify our market leadership and business strength over the years. From this position of strength, we recently took a significant step to empower the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global health care solutions. 
As we announced last month, we entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance to acquire the majority of its Alliance Healthcare business. Through this acquisition, we will extend our distribution capabilities into key new markets, adding depth, breadth and reach and strengthening our global platform of manufacturer and other value-added services. With expanded scale and added services, our combined business will be able to better support pharmaceutical innovation through a global footprint of broad dealership and local expertise, which further positions AmerisourceBergen as the partner of choice. 
The pandemic has heightened both our public and private partners' awareness of the value of a strong and capable pharmaceutical supply chain, and Alliance Healthcare better positions AmerisourceBergen to meet its increasingly global nature as well. As our global footprint expands, so too does the importance of corporate stewardship. AmerisourceBergen understands and appreciates the value of being a responsible enterprise. And our recent initiatives, including continue to advance our talent and culture, accelerating workforce diversity inclusion and further investing in and supporting our associates. 
We remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the safety and wellbeing of our associates as the COVID waves affect various regions and teams, and the importance of the work we're doing remains unwavering. Driven by our purpose, we are maintaining our enhanced protection and safety protocols and appropriately compensating frontline associates. 
Remote work is still the prevailing policy for all suitable roles. We are watching the situation closely as I'm sure all of you are doing, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. 
Underscoring our efforts to support and empower our associates around the world, AmerisourceBergen was recently certified as a Great Place to Work company following their surveys of employees around the world. The survey revealed that our associates reported a consistently positive experience with peers, among leaders and in job responsibilities. We saw high scores for all indicators, and our overall store was significantly higher than the typical U.S.-based company. 
Additionally, for the fourth year in a row, the Human Rights Campaign has recognized AmerisourceBergen as the Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality, awarding us a perfect score on the corporate equality index due to our nondiscrimination policies, equitable benefits, support of an inclusive culture and focus on corporate social responsibility. AmerisourceBergen recognizes the business and personal importance of having a culture that is inclusive and equitable regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity and for veterans and people with disabilities as well. 
To this end, we are accelerating our diversity and inclusion strategy to become an even more diverse and equitable company. Over the past months, we have conducted a comprehensive D&I organizational assessment, initiated a global D&I strategy to support a more measured and engaged workforce, formed a D&I council led by Senior Swiss C-Suite Executive and signed the CEO pledge for diversity and inclusion, which is a commitment to increase diversity and support more inclusive work environments. 
AmerisourceBergen strives to ensure that our associates feel they are part of a fair, inclusive and transparent workplace. A diverse, inclusive and equitable culture is a proven enhancer of business value, and these initiatives will ensure that we have the right programs and tools in place in the short term so that we can become a leader in this area in the longer term. 
Our success in advancing our progressive culture, one that is fueled by the passion, pride and dedication of our purpose-driven associates, is visually embodied by our new brand, which we unveiled last week. The new brand embodies a spirit of innovation with the design that is energizing, confident and inspiring, while also displaying our unity as an enterprise when we go to market. 
As we continue to move our business forward, we remain committed to advancing a differentiated culture that inspires our associates, unites them and helps them develop and achieve their full potential. Our business strength is a direct result of having engaged, passionate and dedicated associates, and a focus on advancing our talent and culture remains a key strategic priority. 
In closing, I want to take this time to thank our associates, who have continued to execute across our business to help us deliver innovative solutions to our partners. As AmerisourceBergen continues to evolve, we are empowered by our purpose, and we will build upon our strengths to drive growth across the enterprise. 
We will further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships, enhance our specialty capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers, continue to focus on execution and supporting innovation and enable positive outcomes globally by facilitating market access and supporting pharmaceutical innovation. I continue to be inspired by, proud of and confident in our teams, who rise to the many challenges and complexities that we face with courage and effectiveness. By being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and well positioned to create long-term sustainable growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we clearly had a strong start to our 2021 fiscal year with growth across our businesses. As I said back in November, we entered fiscal 2021 with strong momentum, and that clearly accelerated in the quarter as our teams executed across the entire portfolio of AmerisourceBergen businesses. 
Guided by our purpose, our teams worked diligently to support pharmaceutical innovation and facilitate patient access to vital medications. AmerisourceBergen's key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders, helping provide key solutions for our partners, both upstream and down, to ultimately ensure patient health and well-being. 
Throughout my tenure with AmerisourceBergen, I have shared my pride in being part of a company that is driven by purpose, focused on execution and unwavering in our efforts to strengthen our associate experience. Our associates power our success, and AmerisourceBergen continues to protect, support and invest in our talent. 
Turning now to discuss our first quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. 
Beginning with our first quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18, an increase of 24% primarily due to exceptional operating income growth across our businesses. Our consolidated revenue was $52.5 billion, up 10% driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which includes our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group of businesses. 
Gross profit increased 15% to $1.4 billion driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 12 basis points from the prior year quarter. This gross margin improvement is due to growth in a number of our higher-margin businesses and in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products. The margin improvement is also due to the gross profit portion of the tailwind related to exiting the PharMEDium business and additionally, a reversal of reserves taken in the back half of fiscal 2020 associated with forecasted inventory value write-downs that did not materialize. The PharMEDium comparison and the inventory write-down reversal contributed 1/3 of the 12 basis point gross profit margin improvement. 
Consolidated operating income was $617 million, up $122 million or 25% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the increased gross profit in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization & Animal Health Group, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. 
To support our revenue growth while protecting, supporting and appropriately compensating our frontline associates, operating expenses grew 8% to $810 million. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue was 1.54%, which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior year quarter. 
Moving now to net interest expense, which increased $3 million to $34 million primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in investment interest rates. Our effective tax rate was 22%, up from 21% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted share count declined modestly to 206.8 million shares. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, our adjusted free cash flow was $838 million in the first quarter. This strong start to the year on cash flow positions us well after the first quarter, and we are on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore. This completes the review of our consolidated results, now I will turn to our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $50.5 billion, up 10% driven by increased specialty product sales, including COVID-19 therapies as well as growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. Segment operating income increased about 27% to $496 million, with operating income margin up 13 basis points. 
As a reminder, the exit of our PharMEDium business represented a $20 million tailwind to the segment's operating income, roughly half of which is in gross profit and the other half in operating expense. Excluding the PharMEDium tailwind, segment operating income growth would have been up 20%. The strong operating income performance was driven by continued positive trends across our robust portfolio of customers and broadly across our businesses and in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products. 
AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty distribution, led by the Specialty Physician Services Group, and our capabilities in supporting specialty sales into health systems continue to provide us the platform to deliver differentiated value for our partners through our scale, reach and expertise. In the quarter, our Specialty Physician Services Group continued its strong growth as practices are prepared operationally to continue to treat their patients throughout COVID challenges. 
Additionally, our health systems business had significant growth as we're helping to facilitate vital access to antiviral and antibody therapies for COVID-19 patients. The fundamentals of the health systems business overall continued to be strong, particularly as we are now also seeing increased biosimilar utilization in this customer segment. While biosimilar utilization continues to be strongest and most impactful on the specialty physician side, we are encouraged to see growing adoption trends in health systems. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 11% driven by growth across the 3 operating segments. Operating income for the group was up $17 million or 16% primarily due to growth at MWI and World Courier. 
MWI is benefiting from ongoing process initiatives and the strength of its customer relationships, particularly in the companion business where veterinarians are benefiting from increased pet ownership, increasing standards of care and adapting well to virtual engagement and limited physical interaction. World Courier has continued to differentiate itself as the provider of choice in global specialty logistics as their commercial customers navigate increased complexity, the need for cell and gene solutions grows, and there is an increased utilization of direct-to-patient capabilities. Additionally, I will note that World Courier's growth rate in the quarter was augmented by foreign currency exchange rates. This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance. 
This updated financial guidance does not include any contribution from the proposed Alliance Healthcare acquisition announced in January 2021. As I have just outlined, AmerisourceBergen delivered exceptional growth in the first quarter and continues to expect positive trends across our business as we move further into fiscal 2021. 
Therefore, as we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $8.25 to $8.50 to our new guidance range of $8.40 to $8.60, reflecting growth of 6% to 9%. We are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021. Revenue is now expected to be in the high single-digit percent growth range as we have seen better-than-expected growth in both Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other. 
Next, operating expenses. We now expect operating expenses to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. We remain committed to investing in, protecting and ensuring the safety and well-being of our associates, especially those on the front lines. 
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the high single-digit percent range. This is a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the high single-digit range, given the significant operating income growth in the first quarter and continued overall positive trends across the business. It also reflects our improved expectation for operating income in Other, which we now believe will grow in the mid- to high single-digit range as a result of positive trends in our Global Commercialization & Animal Health businesses. 
Lastly, regarding shares outstanding, given the cash needs associated with the Alliance acquisition, we are narrowing our guidance from a range of 206 million to 207 million, and we now expect to finish the year around 207 million shares outstanding. All other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021 remain unchanged. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that the March 2021 quarter will be impacted by a tough comparison to the March 2020 quarter, which had a significant pull-forward of sales associated with increased customer purchases at the onset of COVID-19. 
In closing, our strong customer relationships, focus on execution excellence and commitment to innovation will continue to drive our business forward, while enhancing our capabilities to serve our partners and their patients. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned by our key differentiators, and we are excited for how the Alliance Healthcare acquisition will build on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, expanding our reach and further strengthening our global platform for value-added services and solutions. Our work around the acquisition remains on track, and we look forward to welcoming the Alliance Healthcare team. 
These past several quarters have proven the importance of pharmaceutical innovation and access, and I have spoken in great detail about the resilience of AmerisourceBergen's business. Clearly, our results and expectations show that the word resilience understates the strength of our business as our purpose-driven teams are leveraging our capabilities and expertise to provide important value-added solutions to help contribute to positive patient outcomes globally. 
We are making positive contributions to the people, planet and communities where we live and work by being a responsible business. And in our upcoming global sustainability and corporate responsibility report, we will be providing an update on our commitments in these areas to show how our business practices align with many of the leading global sustainability frameworks. 
We know that by doing business thoughtfully and with long-term perspective, AmerisourceBergen can drive sustainable growth while creating value for all our stakeholders and fulfilling our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. 
Now I will turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A. Operator?"

Yes, I'd be happy to talk about guidance and some of the moving pieces. And first of all, I'll say that, of course, it's early in our year and at this stage with the completion of our first fiscal quarter. We've done a",570,"Glen, thanks a lot for the question. Yes, I'd be happy to talk about guidance and some of the moving pieces. And first of all, I'll say that, of course, it's early in our year and at this stage with the completion of our first fiscal quarter. We've done a healthy increase to guidance versus our original guidance in November. We're up $0.20 at the lower end of guidance and up $0.15 at the higher end of guidance. 
And this is really due to the fact that we're seeing positive trends across our businesses and really strong execution across the business, both in pharmaceutical distribution and in commercialization and animal health. And some of the positive trends that we're continuing to see in pharmaceutical distribution include continued very good performance in specialty physician services; very strong performance also in health systems, including the distribution of COVID treatments. We're seeing strong biosimilar growth in Q1 in both specialty physician services and in health systems and very good growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. 
And then Commercialization Services & Animal Health, we're seeing strong growth and MWI and World Courier with continued positive trends. And so as we think about guidance beyond these overall positive trends that I've mentioned just now and in my prepared remarks, there are also some noteworthy moving pieces to call out related, first of all, to the exit of PharMEDium. We had our final tailwind in Q1, a $20 million tailwind related to the exit of PharMEDium in Q1, which, of course, doesn't repeat in future quarters. 
We also had, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the inventory write-down recovery in Q1. That was a $10 million benefit to GP in Q1, which, of course, doesn't repeat in future quarters. 
And then also in Q2, we begin to lap the significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization. And so the contribution to operating income will continue to grow from biosimilars but not at the same rates we saw in the last 3 quarters of fiscal '20 or the first quarter of fiscal '21. And then also, a key point with regard to our guidance assumptions is our guidance assumes that our sales of COVID therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year than they were in the first quarter, particularly during the second half of the fiscal year. 
Regarding OpEx, we're starting to compare to the part of the fiscal year that had notably low expenses, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. And as you'll recall, we called out in fiscal '20, particularly in the back half of the year, that last year, we benefited from lower OpEx growth associated with lower health care costs and travel. 
And then finally, Glen, there's a couple of things below the operating income line. We assume in our guidance that the acquisition debt for the Alliance acquisition is issued a few months before closing the acquisition, and we have associated carrying costs. And then also importantly, there's no share repurchases in our guidance as we prepare for the acquisition. 
So overall, I'd say that we feel very good about the increase in guidance. The fundamentals in our business are strong as evidenced by the excellent Q1 results, and we've done a good increase in guidance, particularly given the fact that it's early in the fiscal year."

So I'm sure the underlying performance has to be pretty fantastic if that's the case or at least headwinds for the rest of the year, I guess, we would call it. 
I'm really interested. You've talked a lot about patient access and manufacturer services. And I think in the past, The Street perhaps thought that was maybe a bit more lip service than it really is. I mean we're seeing it with these $2 billion revenue beat in a quarter with low scripts and low cough, cold, flu season. 
You've talked a lot about COVID therapies, and I know you've had several exclusive deals with manufacturers. I'm curious if you could possibly quantify the revenue impact and maybe even margin impact if you're willing to go that far on the antiviral and antibody distribution to health systems that you've highlighted a few times today?"

You have the fundamentals of our business and the execution and the performance of our businesses, very strong. 
With regards to the impact of COVID therapies, approximately $0.12 of EPS in the first quarter is due to the net impact of COVID, and this reflects the important work we're doing distributing COVID therapies. And it also includes elevated expenses associated with things like associate bonuses for frontline associates; the cleaning costs; payroll ramp, which represents things like quarantine pay, overtime and temporary help; and the expenses that I just described for a couple pennies during the quarter and are included in the $0.12 of net benefit to EPS during the quarter that I just mentioned. 
And I think one important thing to call out that our guidance does assume that our sales at COVID therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year, particularly in the second half of the year. But in summary, the net benefit during the quarter was $0.12 of EPS."

I'm worried I won't get a question if I don't answer this, given all the guidance. But I just think we should go back to the 2013 deal. And it was really a remarkable deal that, in many ways, changed our industry. WBAD, of course, was a key feature in that. That was a big change in our industry, and we get much more competitive pricing for our generics, but also the way we structured the distribution agreement with taking on the generics of Walgreens, which I think it's been a terrific benefit to not only Walgreens and ourselves and our scale and leverage and also brought, again, more competitive pricing to our customers. 
So the way we set that up was really brilliant, I think, and very -- it stood the test of time. And the agreement has started regulating mechanisms, and it's still working through [ 2029 ], which this next phase of our contract will go through. We took into account changes in brand mix, many areas like that. So we didn't really have to make the adjustments because those market mechanisms are already in place. And then the second part of your question I believe Jim was going to answer."

The second part of the question was on utilization. And I will say on the -- with regard to the Walgreens relationship, we are really excited also about expanding the agreement and all the initiatives that we're going to be working on with Walgreens with regard to growth and efficiency around things like sourcing, logistics and distribution and the potential synergies that we have targeted there. 
And then on utilization, we aren't really calling out anything on January at this point, and we're still in the first few days of February. But I'll just comment then on the first quarter. In the first quarter of the year, we really saw very strong fundamental trends throughout our businesses, many of which we talked about in the prepared remarks. And that's what I've really focused on and we've really focused on in the company is the sales data and sales trends in our businesses. 
And probably given our strength in specialty, clearly, we've seen strong trends in specialty physician services and strong trends in health systems but I'll also say just broadly across our businesses. We saw good volume and profitability trends across our businesses in both pharmaceutical distribution and our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses."

And you asked about the impact of COVID on the Other segment.

So COVID has enabled World Courier to really show its value. 
And then I think the second part of your question had to do with guidance. And we've really kind of gone through the guidance in prepared remarks and the first question, but I guess you talked about cadence. And so the one thing that I'd reemphasize is if we look at cadence for the year, we had a particularly strong quarter in the March quarter of fiscal '20 is there was a pull-forward of sales during the month of March with the onset of COVID. And so that makes the March quarter of '21 a little bit tougher comp."

We had [ Dr. Gottlieb ] as a guest at our ThinkLive commercialization summit. And of course, we are all fixated on this. And I do believe that the U.S. is going to get tremendous amounts of supply in the next couple of months. 
And the pharmaceutical distribution is highly efficient and sophisticated. I kind of bristle a bit when people point to any impediment to vaccination and distribution, and it's just such a misnomer. And we believe that people will get -- the patients will -- the supply chain will not be a problem. As you know, the U.S. has got an appropriate infrastructure to ensure accurate and timely delivery. 
I also do appreciate that in the U.S., we've seen that this really enhances the role of distribution and supply chain as the whole COVID pandemic has really exposed the importance. And we like to talk about companies like AmerisourceBergen being invisible pillar of innovation. And I think that's very true. Without us, getting the products to market and the access that we talk about so much has been -- would not be as efficient as it is. 
We are doing the distribution in Canada. Of course, Canada is sourcing their product from Europe. We're proud of that role, and also proud that our World Courier business is doing some very complex logistics. We actually heard again at the ThinkLive summit the heralding story of Norway, where we had to charter a boat to get some products to remote island before it expired. So there's terrific stories. I'm sure that everyone involved in this unique logistics and distribution challenges has got great stories to tell. 
Moreover, I would just say our future alliance company, and of course, we'll let them talk about it, will also play a role in vaccine distribution. So ABC is well positioned to be a central provider for logistics and distribution."

And let me kind of go through some of the things that drove it. 
One was increased specialty product sales at both specialty physician services and health systems, really in both specialty physician services and health systems that included biosimilars. But as we've talked a lot about in health systems, it also included COVID-19 treatments so really kind of that. That was one of the drivers of our increased gross margin during the quarter. 
And we continue to see the positive trends in biosimilars. But of course, as we've commented on, we began to see significant utilization of biosimilars in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and we start to lap that significant year-over-year comparison difference now. And so we'll continue to see growth in biosimilars but perhaps at a lower rates. 
Other things that helped our margin, getting back to your question, we are seeing growth overall in our higher-margin businesses. So specialty physician services we talked about, MWI and World Courier are also higher-margin businesses. Growth in those higher-margin businesses is adding to our gross profit. 
And then the other thing that I've called out is exiting the PharMEDium business helps our -- helped our gross profit. About half of the benefit was in GP and the other half in OpEx, so that helped our gross profit. And then the reversal of the inventory write-down reserve that I mentioned, that also helped our gross profit during the quarter. 
So there were a number of different things. But really, the performance of our businesses was excellent. And the performance of our higher-margin businesses was particularly strong during the quarter."

In addition to these results, as we announced in January, we entered into a strategic transaction with Walgreens Boots Alliance to acquire the majority of its Alliance Healthcare business and extend and expand our existing distribution agreement. As we have said, these agreements are part of the next evolution of enhancing AmerisourceBergen's ability to deliver innovative solutions for our partners, further building on our platform to deliver key distribution capabilities and value-added services to support patient access in new geographies. 
AmerisourceBergen's ongoing focus on patient access means providing innovative services and solutions to support our manufacturer partners and provide customers with our differentiated value proposition. World Courier, for example, is highly sought after for its expertise in helping manufacturing partners navigate complexities on a global scale. 
During the pandemic, World Courier's proven track record as an international leader in specialty logistics have enabled us to support our customers worldwide against a backdrop of changing local restrictions, limited air traffic and additional operational challenges. We have been able to facilitate direct-to-patient services and global clinical trials at a time when both demand and complexity for these services was understandably at its peak. 
Similarly, we continue to support patient access to vital treatments for COVID-19. Thanks to our robust suite of specialty distribution capabilities and our deep industry expertise, we are uniquely positioned to support our public and private partners. And AmerisourceBergen is both honored and proud to be able to be part of the solution to help them preserve public health. 
In the U.S., we continue to be the distributor of antiviral and antibody therapies, which are playing an increasingly important role as more and more hospitalized patients are receiving these treatments to help them recover from COVID-19. In Canada, our Innomar business is partnering with FedEx as the primary distributor for the COVID vaccine. 
Our team in Innomar is safely and securely storing the vaccines in its storage facilities across Canada and packaging them to support the temperature requirements specified by the manufacturer. AmerisourceBergen's scale and expertise in specialty as well as our culture of delivering collaborative and innovative solutions enable this important work. 
We have spent years building on and enhancing our leadership in specialty distribution. This continued investment in, and focus on, an important part of the pharmaceutical market continues to benefit both AmerisourceBergen and our partners. 
And over the last several months, the ability of our sourcing and commercial teams to leverage our expertise and data and analytics capability is foundational to our ability to play an important role in providing the specialty distribution solutions for COVID-related treatments. We deliver a clear and differentiated value proposition for our partners in the U.S. health care system and continue to focus on building on our strengths in specialty distribution as those capabilities continue to be even more important to all our customers. 
AmerisourceBergen's strong portfolio of customers is another important differentiator for us as it is an important driver of growth across our businesses. Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has made it a priority to have long-term strategic relationships with manufacturers and providers that embrace and appreciate collaboration. 
As we announced last month, we have agreed to strengthen our strategic partnership with Walgreens by extending and expanding our commercial agreements. This extended and expanded partnership in the U.S. will allow us to create incremental growth and efficiency opportunities, enabling each of our enterprises to better serve our respective customers. 
Teams from both our companies have already identified new opportunities for enhanced growth and efficiency in the areas of logistics, transportation and distribution. As we continue to realize improved capabilities derived from this partnership, these initiatives will enhance our ability to create differentiated value for all of AmerisourceBergen's customers. 
One customer group for whom we have consistently created new incremental value is our independent pharmacy customers, including our more than 5,000 Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Provider Network members. These independent pharmacies provide critical care for their communities, and their fearlessness and adaptability as entrepreneurs have enabled them to rise to the changes of the pandemic. 
We are proud to have been able to support them with the tools they have needed to connect with their patients and keep them healthy. We look forward to working as a medical administrator on behalf of qualified and eligible pharmacy network partners to support vaccination efforts in their communities when we enter the broader inoculation phase here in the United States. 
In the Animal Health segment, our MWI business has moved swiftly to deliver innovative solutions to help our customers succeed in the current environment. These include ensuring that MWI associates are accessible to our customers 24/7 and bolstering our customers' abilities to offer virtual services to their pet parent clients, including innovative client communication solutions and home delivery services of quality medications and pet care products. 
AmerisourceBergen's long-term focus on strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty distribution and manufacturer services and our continued ability to support innovation had solidified our market leadership and business strength over the years. From this position of strength, we recently took a significant step to empower the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global health care solutions. 
As we announced last month, we entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance to acquire the majority of its Alliance Healthcare business. Through this acquisition, we will extend our distribution capabilities into key new markets, adding depth, breadth and reach and strengthening our global platform of manufacturer and other value-added services. With expanded scale and added services, our combined business will be able to better support pharmaceutical innovation through a global footprint of broad dealership and local expertise, which further positions AmerisourceBergen as the partner of choice. 
The pandemic has heightened both our public and private partners' awareness of the value of a strong and capable pharmaceutical supply chain, and Alliance Healthcare better positions AmerisourceBergen to meet its increasingly global nature as well. As our global footprint expands, so too does the importance of corporate stewardship. 
AmerisourceBergen understands and appreciates the value of being a responsible enterprise, and our recent initiatives including continuing to advance our talent and culture, accelerating workforce diversity and inclusion and further investing in and supporting our associates. We remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the safety and wellbeing of our associates as the COVID waves affect various regions and teams, and the importance of the work we're doing remains unwavering. 
Driven by our purpose, we are maintaining our enhanced protection and safety protocols and appropriately compensating frontline associates. Remote work is still the prevailing policy for all suitable roles. We are watching the situation closely, as I'm sure all of you are doing, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. 
Underscoring our efforts to support and empower our associates around the world, AmerisourceBergen was recently certified as a Great Place to Work company, following their surveys of employees around the world. The survey revealed that our associates reported a consistently positive experience with peers, among leaders and in job responsibilities. We saw high scores for all indicators, and our overall score was significantly higher than the typical U.S.-based company. 
Additionally, for the fourth year in a row, the Human Rights Campaign has recognized AmerisourceBergen as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality, awarding us a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index due to our nondiscrimination policies, equitable benefits, support of an inclusive culture and focus on corporate social responsibility. AmerisourceBergen recognizes the business and personal importance of having a culture that is inclusive and equitable, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, and for veterans and people with disabilities as well. 
To this end, we are accelerating our diversity and inclusion strategy to become an even more diverse and equitable company. Over the past months, we have conducted a comprehensive D&I organizational assessment; initiated a global D&I strategy to support a more measured and engaged workforce; formed a D&I Council, led by senior C-suite executive; and signed the CEO Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion, which is a commitment to increase diversity and support more inclusive work environments. 
AmerisourceBergen strives to ensure that our associates feel they are part of a fair, inclusive and transparent workplace. A diverse, inclusive and equitable culture is a proven enhancer of business value, and these initiatives will ensure that we have the right programs and tools in place in the short term so that we can become a leader in this area in the longer term. 
Our success in advancing our progressive culture, one that is fueled by the passion, pride and dedication of our purpose-driven associates, is visually embodied by our new brand, which we unveiled last week. The new brand embodies a spirit of innovation with the design that is energizing, confident and inspiring, while also displaying our unity as an enterprise when we go to market. 
As we continue to move our business forward, we remain committed to advancing a differentiated culture that inspires our associates, unites them and helps them develop and achieve their full potential. Our business strength is a direct result of having engaged, passionate and dedicated associates, and a focus on advancing our talent and culture remains a key strategic priority. 
In closing, I want to take this time to thank our associates, who have continued to execute across our business to help us deliver innovative solutions to our partners. As AmerisourceBergen continues to evolve, we are empowered by our purpose, and we will build upon our strengths to drive growth across the enterprise. 
We will further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships, enhance our specialty capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers, continue to focus on execution and supporting innovation and enable positive outcomes globally by facilitating market access and supporting pharmaceutical innovation. I continue to be inspired by, proud of and confident in our teams, who rise to the many challenges and complexities that we face with courage and effectiveness. By being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and well positioned to create long-term sustainable growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our financials. Jim?"
24809,699851355,2191994,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAA",1741,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we clearly had a strong start to our 2021 fiscal year, with growth across our businesses. As I said back in November, we entered fiscal 2021 with strong momentum, and that clearly accelerated in the quarter as our teams executed across the entire portfolio of AmerisourceBergen businesses. 
Guided by our purpose, our teams worked diligently to support pharmaceutical innovation and facilitate patient access to vital medications. AmerisourceBergen's key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders, helping provide key solutions for our partners, both upstream and down, to ultimately ensure patient health and well-being. 
Throughout my tenure with AmerisourceBergen, I have shared my pride in being part of a company that is driven by purpose, focused on execution and unwavering in our efforts to strengthen our associate experience. Our associates power our success, and AmerisourceBergen continues to protect, support and invest in our talent. 
Turning now to discuss our first quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. 
Beginning with our first quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18, an increase of 24%, primarily due to exceptional operating income growth across our businesses. Our consolidated revenue was $52.5 billion, up 10%, driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which includes our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group of businesses. 
Gross profit increased 15% to $1.4 billion driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 12 basis points from the prior year quarter. This gross margin improvement is due to growth in a number of our higher-margin businesses and, in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products. 
The margin improvement is also due to the gross profit portion of the tailwind related to exiting the PharMEDium business and, additionally, a reversal of reserves taken in the back half of fiscal 2020 associated with forecasted inventory value write-downs that did not materialize. The PharMEDium comparison and the inventory write-down reversal contributed 1/3 of the 12 basis point gross profit margin improvement. 
Consolidated operating income was $617 million, up $122 million or 25% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the increased gross profit in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization & Animal Health group, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment-level performance. 
To support our revenue growth while protecting, supporting and appropriately compensating our frontline associates, operating expenses grew 8% to $810 million. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue was 1.54%, which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior year quarter. 
Moving now to net interest expense, which increased $3 million to $34 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in investment interest rates. Our effective tax rate was 22%, up from 21% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted share count declined modestly to 206.8 million shares. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, our adjusted free cash flow was $838 million in the first quarter. This strong start to the year on cash flow positions us well after the first quarter, and we are on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $50.5 billion, up 10%, driven by increased specialty product sales, including COVID-19 therapies, as well as growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. Segment operating income increased about 27% to $496 million, with operating income margin up 13 basis points. 
As a reminder, the exit of the PharMEDium business represented a $20 million tailwind to the segment's operating income, roughly half of which is in gross profit and the other half in operating expense. Excluding the PharMEDium tailwind, segment operating income growth would have been up 20%. The strong operating income performance was driven by continued positive trends across our robust portfolio of customers and broadly across our businesses and, in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products. 
AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty distribution, led by the specialty physician services group and our capabilities in supporting specialty sales into health systems, continue to provide us the platform to deliver differentiated value for our partners through our scale, reach and expertise. In the quarter, our specialty physician services group continued its strong growth as practices are prepared operationally to continue to treat their patients throughout COVID challenges. 
Additionally, our health systems business had significant growth as we're helping to facilitate vital access to antiviral and antibody therapies for COVID-19 patients. The fundamentals of the health systems business overall continued to be strong, particularly as we are now also seeing increased biosimilar utilization in this customer segment. While biosimilar utilization continues to be strongest and most impactful on the specialty physician side, we are encouraged to see growing adoption trends in health systems. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 11%, driven by growth across the 3 operating segments. Operating income for the group was up $17 million or 16%, primarily due to growth at MWI and World Courier. 
MWI is benefiting from ongoing process initiatives and the strength of its customer relationships, particularly in the companion business, where veterinarians are benefiting from increased pet ownership, increasing standards of care and adapting well to virtual engagement and limited physical interaction. World Courier has continued to differentiate itself as the provider of choice in global specialty logistics as their commercial customers navigate increased complexity, the need for cell and gene solutions grows, and there's an increased utilization of direct-to-patient capabilities. Additionally, I will note that World Courier's growth rate in the quarter was augmented by foreign currency exchange rates. 
This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance. This updated financial guidance does not include any contribution from the proposed Alliance Healthcare acquisition announced in January 2021. 
As I have just outlined, AmerisourceBergen delivered exceptional growth in the first quarter and continues to expect positive trends across our business as we move further into fiscal 2021. Therefore, as we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $8.25 to $8.50 to our new guidance range of $8.40 to $8.60, reflecting growth of 6% to 9%. 
We are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021. Revenue is now expected to be in the high single-digit percent growth range as we have seen better-than-expected growth in both Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other. 
Next, operating expenses. We now expect operating expenses to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. We remain committed to investing in, protecting and ensuring the safety and well-being of our associates, especially those on the front lines. 
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the high single-digit percent range. This is a result of raising our Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income guidance to the high single-digit range, given the significant operating income growth in the first quarter and continued overall positive trends across the business. It also reflects our improved expectation for operating income in Other, which we now believe will grow in the mid- to high single-digit range as a result of positive trends in our Global Commercialization & Animal Health businesses. 
Lastly, regarding shares outstanding, given the cash needs associated with the Alliance acquisition, we are narrowing our guidance from a range of 206 million to 207 million, and we now expect to finish the year around 207 million shares outstanding. All other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021 remain unchanged. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that the March 2021 quarter will be impacted by a tough comparison to the March 2020 quarter, which had a significant pull-forward of sales associated with increased customer purchases at the onset of COVID-19. 
In closing, our strong customer relationships, focus on execution excellence and commitment to innovation will continue to drive our business forward, while enhancing our capabilities to serve our partners and their patients. 
AmerisourceBergen is well positioned by our key differentiators, and we are excited for how the Alliance Healthcare acquisition will build on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, expanding our reach and further strengthening our global platform for value-added services and solutions. Our work around the acquisition remains on track, and we look forward to welcoming the Alliance Healthcare teams. 
These past several quarters have proven the importance of pharmaceutical innovation and access, and I have spoken in great detail about the resilience of AmerisourceBergen's business. Clearly, our results and expectations show that the word resilience understates the strength of our business as our purpose-driven teams are leveraging our capabilities and expertise to provide important value-added solutions to help contribute to positive patient outcomes globally. 
We are making positive contributions to the people, planet and communities where we live and work by being a responsible business. And in our upcoming global sustainability and corporate responsibility report, we will be providing an update on our commitments in these areas to show how our business practices align with many of the leading global sustainability frameworks. 
We know that by doing business thoughtfully and with long-term perspective, AmerisourceBergen can drive sustainable growth, while creating value for all our stakeholders and fulfilling our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. 
Now I will turn the call over to the operator to start our Q&A. Operator?"

It's kind of hard to reconcile all the moving pieces in the fiscal '21 guidance. You raised the guidance last month when the company announced the Alliance Healthcare acquisition, and now you're raising it again today with these better-than-expected 1Q results. So could you maybe help us think about maybe what has changed from the beginning of the fiscal year, while taking into consideration some of the incremental COVID-related benefits you called out in the release and your prepared remarks?"
24809,699851355,2191994,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Glen, thanks a lot for the question. Yes, I'd be happy to talk about guidance and some of the moving pieces. And first of all, I'll say that, of course, it's early in our year and at this stage. And after the completion of our first fiscal quarter, we've",571,"Glen, thanks a lot for the question. Yes, I'd be happy to talk about guidance and some of the moving pieces. And first of all, I'll say that, of course, it's early in our year and at this stage. And after the completion of our first fiscal quarter, we've done a healthy increase to guidance versus our original guidance in November. We're up $0.20 at the lower end of guidance and up $0.15 at the higher end of guidance. 
And this is really due to the fact that we're seeing positive trends across our businesses and really strong execution across the business, both in Pharmaceutical Distribution and in commercialization and Animal Health. And some of the positive trends that we're continuing to see in Pharmaceutical Distribution include continued very good performance in specialty physician services, very strong performance also in health systems, including the distribution of COVID treatments. 
We're seeing strong biosimilar growth in Q1 in both specialty physician services and in health systems and very good growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. And then Commercialization Services & Animal Health, we're seeing strong growth in MWI and World Courier with continued positive trends. 
And so as we think about guidance beyond these overall positive trends that I've mentioned just now and in my prepared remarks, there are also some noteworthy moving pieces to call out related, first of all, to the exit of PharMEDium. We had our final tailwind in Q1, a $20 million tailwind related to the exit of PharMEDium in Q1, which, of course, doesn't repeat in future quarters. 
We also had, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the inventory write-down recovery in Q1. That was a $10 million benefit to GP in Q1, which, of course, doesn't repeat in future quarters. 
And then also, in Q2, we begin to lap the significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization. And so the contribution to operating income will continue to grow from biosimilars but not at the same rates we saw in the last 3 quarters of fiscal '20 or the first quarter of fiscal '21. And then also, a key point with regard to our guidance assumptions is our guidance assumes that our sales of COVID therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year than they were in the first quarter, particularly during the second half of the fiscal year. 
Regarding OpEx, we're starting to compare to the part of the fiscal year that had notably low expenses, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. And as you'll recall, we called out in fiscal '20, particularly in the back half of the year, that last year, we benefited from lower OpEx growth associated with lower health care costs and travel. 
And then finally, Glen, there's a couple of things below the operating income line. We assume in our guidance that the acquisition debt for the Alliance acquisition is issued a few months before closing the acquisition, and we have associated carrying costs. And then also, importantly, there's no share repurchases in our guidance as we prepare for the acquisition. 
So overall, I'd say that we feel very good about the increase in guidance. The fundamentals in our business are strong, as evidenced by the excellent Q1 results, and we've done a good increase in guidance, particularly given the fact that it's early in the fiscal year."

So I'm sure the underlying performance has to be pretty fantastic if that's the case, or at least headwinds for the rest of the year, I guess, we wouldn't call it. 
I'm really interested. You've talked a lot about patient access and manufacturer services. And I think, in the past, The Street perhaps thought that was maybe a bit more lip service than it really is. I mean we're seeing it with these $2 billion revenue beat in the quarter with low scripts and low cough, cold, flu season. 
You've talked a lot about COVID therapies, and I know you've had several exclusive deals with manufacturers. I'm curious if you could possibly quantify the revenue impact and maybe even the margin impact, if you're willing to go that far, on the antiviral and antibody distribution to health systems that you've highlighted a few times today?"

Yes, the fundamentals of our business and the execution and the performance of our businesses have been very strong. 
With regard to the impact of COVID therapies, approximately $0.12 of EPS in the first quarter is due to the net impact of COVID, and this reflects the important work we're doing distributing COVID therapies. And it also includes elevated expenses associated with things like associate bonuses for frontline associates, kind of cleaning costs, a payroll ramp, which represents things like quarantine pay, overtime and temporary help. And that the expenses that I just described were a couple pennies during the quarter and are included in the $0.12 of net benefit to EPS during the quarter that I just mentioned. 
And I think one important thing to call out is that our guidance does assume that our sales of COVID therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year, particularly in the second half of the year. But in summary, the net benefit during the quarter was $0.12 of EPS."

I'm worried I won't get a question if I don't answer this one, given all the guidance there. But I just think we should go back to the 2013 deal. And it was really a remarkable deal that, in many ways, changed our industry. 
WBAD, of course, was a key feature in that. That was a big change in our industry. And we were able to get much more competitive pricing for our generics, but also the way we structured the distribution agreement with taking on the generics of Walgreens, which I think it's been a terrific benefit to not only Walgreens, but to ourselves and our scale and leverage and also brought, again, more competitive pricing to our customers. 
So the way we set that up was really brilliant, I think, and very -- it stood the test of time. And the agreement has self-regulating mechanisms, and it's still working through 2029, which this next phase of our contract will go through. We took into account changes in brand mix, many areas like that. So we didn't really have to make the adjustments because those market mechanisms were already in place. 
And then the second part of your question, I believe, Jim was going to answer."

And then on utilization, we aren't really calling out anything on January at this point. We're still in the first few days of February. But I'll just comment then on the first quarter. In the first quarter of the year, we really saw very strong fundamental trends throughout our businesses, many of which we talked about in the prepared remarks. 
And that's what I've really focused on, and we've really focused on as a company, is the sales data and sales trends in our businesses. And probably given our strength in specialty, clearly, we've seen strong trends in specialty physician services and strong trends in health systems, but I'll also say just broadly across our businesses. We saw good volume and profitability trends across our businesses in both Pharmaceutical Distribution and our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses."

And then just as we're looking out over the balance of the year, guidance is calling for growth somewhere south of that. I know you have somewhat easy comp in fiscal 3Q. So anything just on the cadence over the course of the year and what might drive that sequential deceleration would be helpful."

And really, call it, probably the one thing I'll call out is that it's been an opportunity for World Courier really to prove its value to manufacturer partners, with things like direct-to-patient capability and with things like [ Ship Guard ] best-in-class solutions, being able to help manufacturers navigate the complex environment for global logistics that has become more complex in the COVID environment. And so COVID has enabled World Courier to really show its value. 
And then I think the second part of your question had to do with the guidance. And we've really kind of gone through the guidance in prepared remarks and the first question, but I guess you talked about cadence. And so the one thing that I'd reemphasize is if we look at cadence for the year, we had a particularly strong quarter in the March quarter of fiscal '20 is there was a pull-forward of sales during the month of March with the onset of COVID. And so that makes the March quarter of '21 a little bit tougher comp."

We had Dr. Gottlieb as a guest at our ThinkLive Commercialization summit. And of course, we are all fixated on this. And I do believe that the U.S. is going to get tremendous amounts of supply in the next couple of months. 
And the Pharmaceutical Distribution is highly efficient and sophisticated. I kind of wrestle a bit when people point to any impediment to vaccination and distribution, and it's just such a misnomer. And we believe that people will get -- the patients will -- well, the supply chain will not be a problem. As you know, the U.S. has got an appropriate infrastructure to ensure accurate and timely delivery. 
I also do appreciate that, in the U.S., we've seen that this really enhances the role of distribution and supply chain as the whole COVID pandemic has, really, explodes the importance. And we like to talk about companies like AmerisourceBergen being the invisible pillar of innovation, and I think that's very true. Without us -- that getting the products to market and the access that we talk about so much has been -- would not be as efficient as it is. 
We are doing the distribution in Canada. Of course, Canada is sourcing their product from Europe. We're proud of that role, and also proud that our World Courier business is doing some very complex logistics. We actually heard again at the ThinkLive summit the heralding story of Norway, where we had to charter a boat to get some products to remote island before it expire. So there's terrific stories. I'm sure that everyone involved in this unique logistics and distribution challenges has got great stories to tell. 
Moreover, I would just say our future Alliance company and, of course, we'll let them talk about it, is also playing a role in vaccine distribution. So ABC is well positioned to be a central provider for logistics and distribution. Thanks."

And let me kind of go through some of the things that drove it. 
One was increased specialty product sales at both specialty physician services and health systems. Really, in both specialty physician services and health systems, that included biosimilars. But as we've talked a lot about in health systems, it also included COVID-19 treatments. And so really kind of that, that was one of the drivers of our increased gross margin during the quarter. 
And we continue to see the positive trends in biosimilars. But of course, as we've commented on, we began to see significant utilization of biosimilars in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and we start to lap that significant year-over-year comparison difference now. And so we'll continue to see growth in biosimilars, but perhaps at a lower rates. 
Other things that helped our margin, getting back to your question, we are seeing growth overall in our higher-margin businesses. So specialty physician services we've talked about. MWI and World Courier are also higher-margin businesses. Growth in those higher-margin businesses is adding to our gross profit. 
And then the other thing that I've called out is exiting the PharMEDium business helps our -- helped our gross profit. About half of that benefit was in GP and the other half in OpEx, so that helped our gross profit. And then the reversal of the inventory write-down reserve that I mentioned, that also helped our gross profit during the quarter. 
So there were a number of different things. But really, they'll be -- the performance of our businesses was excellent. And the performance of our higher-margin businesses was particularly strong during the quarter."

It's hard to believe that 1 year ago on this call, I -- for the first time how AmerisourceBergen was responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic. There were many uncertainties said about how COVID-19 will impact our lives, our families and our communities. Part of our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, AmerisourceBergen enacted decisively to protect and support our associates, maintain business continuity and help our customers navigate increased complexity. Our people and businesses prove resilient and the pharmaceutical distribution industry demonstrated its vital role as a key for that in the health care system. I remain incredibly proud and inspired by where our associates and teams have adapted and innovated to support our needs and facilitate patient [ exit ]. Powered by our talent and culture enabled by robust infrastructure and technology, AmerisourceBergen is providing value-added data-driven solutions to empower our partners with channel awareness and solutions. 
Importantly, our differentiated capabilities enabled us to continue to support pharmaceutical innovation and the pandemic response both in the U.S. and increasingly abroad. This role is important for our people, our communities and our partners and live our purpose by operating value for all our stakeholders. 
Turning now to our quarterly financial results. As we announced earlier this morning, AmerisourceBergen delivered year-over-year growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues were $49 billion, representing growth of 4% from the same period last year, and our adjusted EPS grew 5% year-over-year. These results were driven by strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty, innovative services and solutions, our purpose-driven culture that unites us in our responsibility to create healthier futures. 
One way that we are living our purpose is our leading role though providing COV19 support going. In the U.S., we continue to distribute the antiviral and antibody therapies to health systems across the country. Through our work with the strategic national stockpile, we are supporting government preparedness for current and future potential pharmaceutical needs. Members of our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network are providing vaccine access  in their communities as we facilitate their participation in the federal retail pharmacy program. The efforts are especially important in the nationwide inoculation movement because their role as highly trusted medical professionals in the communities enables them to quickly, efficiently and definitively serve local hard-to-reach populations. 
Outside the United States, we continue to play an active role in global vaccination efforts. In Canada, for example, our business is working in partnership with FedEx to distribute the COVID-19 backseat on behalf of the Canadian government. 
As I mentioned earlier, AmerisourceBergen is focused on providing value-added services and innovative customer-centric solutions, and that focus has only been amplified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our associates are facilitating an efficient and resilient supply chain to ensure patients have access to the critical medication. In supportive of pharmaceutical innovation, we are providing key commercialization and distribution solutions for our partners to help them adapt to the current dynamic environment. We are leveraging our leadership in specialty distribution and services to further enhance our differentiated value proposition for our partners. This includes expanding our robust suite of specialty capability and data and analytics solutions to further solidify our position as a partner of choice and essential for us avoiding pharmaceutical innovation and access. 
Just this last week, we are able to leverage the full breadth of AmerisourceBergen's capabilities, including our logistical expertise and efficient execution to be a solution provider for public and private partners. Working with the U.S. government and our manufacturer partner, we were able to facilitate the transportation of antiviral therapies to India. I am both honored and humbled that we were able to live our purpose in this time of need around the world. 
This effort would not have been possible with our World Courier business, a key global specialty logistics program. World Courier continues to support the innovation of manufacturers as they now navigate logistical complexities. The importance of World Courier's expertise  has never been clearer over the past year as our partner shifted to perform more clinical trials at patent homes through our industry-leading direct patient capabilities, given the challenges of interfacing with patients and traditional clinical setting. World Courier's unparalleled logistical services, combined with partnerships that enable a broad network of field-based services, have proven invaluable keeping clinical trials moving forward. Our teams have been adaptable and creative and they provide solutions to facilitate better outcomes for the communities and patients and our partners, too. 
Our MWI Animal Health business also continued its strong performance this quarter, thanks to its strong manufacturer and provider relationships as well as its ability to facilitate better help for both companion and production animals. To support the continued growth of the MWI business and further our operational efficiency, we recently opened a new state-of-the-art animal health distribution center in the U.S. This new vicinity bolsters our animal health distribution network and enhances our service capabilities for their areas and other animal health care providers nationwide. 
AmerisourceBergen's continued ability to provide differentiated value to our customers and partners and deliver on our promise of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures is enhanced by our ability to execute on our core growth strategies. First, we remain focused on our customers. One of our core differentiators with our portfolio of key anchor customers across each segment of our business. This customer base enables us to lead with market leaders and facilitate patient access wherever prescription is needed. We intend to continue to strengthen our key customer relationships and enhance our customer-centric solutions globally. 
Second, we will continue to build upon our leadership. We have the strongest portfolio of customer relationships and value-added services in the industry, which enables us to advance and benefit on pharmaceutical innovation enhancing our capabilities in specialty to support both our upstream partners and downstream customers, main important area of focus for AmerisourceBergen. 
Thirdly, we continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service and developing innovative approaches to better service our customers. By embracing advanced technology data and analytics, we provide solution-oriented and value-added innovations and enable all our customers to grow this time into our first growth strategies because when our customers grow, we grow. 
Fourth, we see to enable positive prescription pharmaceutical outcomes globally by facilitating market access and supporting pharmaceutical innovation by providing value-added services that facilitate commercialization as well as integrated solutions to facilitate patient access on top of our unparalleled scale and expertise, we are able to get therapies to small and large patient populations. This approach enables partnerships that unlock our potential and move health forward. 
Our associates remain key to our success, and our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion as well as investments in our deepening culture have long been pivotal in advancing these growth strategies and positioning AmerisourceBergen for long-term success. Our strategy and culture are foundational to reinforcing our legacy of strong corporate -- which focuses on bringing people first and ensuring the continued financial health of our businesses by creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
To ensure that the value we create is sustainable, we are embedding ESG principles into our culture, businesses and process. They -- our overall growth strategy. Our environmental strategy focuses on adapting to a change in climate and advancing a resilient and responsible supply chain. We are leveraging our infrastructure and technology to create an efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain that also allows us to reduce waste, lower our global carbon footprint and prepare for unexpected events. 
For example, we collaborate with our partners and customers to create packaging and transportation efficiencies that result in significant process cost and environmental improvements. We also understand our climate-related physical risks and have a vast business continuity plan in place to ensure we can continue to deliver life-saving medications. 
On the social side, our strategy is centered around corporate responsibility and focused on investing in our people and communities to inspire our team members and foster healthy communities. We continue to, as we have throughout the pandemic, to ensure we protect our associates and their families with enhanced -- additional bonuses, physical and mental health resources and childcare and -- care benefits as part of our strong benefit programs, which now include extended paid parental leave. 
For our frontline associates, we have additional important measures such as enhanced cleaning protocols, social distancing protections and providing them with PPE. For the long term, we advanced our talent and culture by investing in the development of our people. These investments -- a new leadership competency model and development programs supported by [ low-cost ] learning technology -- guiding principles. The program focuses our leaders on creating an energized, diverse and inclusive workplace, leveraging collaboration to create and realize new opportunities, innovating and executing to prepare for the future with creative resourcefulness and being action-based to rapidly adapt to our dynamic landscape. 
To help all our services unlock their full potential and empowering to reach [ their goals ], we've also launched a new enterprise dealing model that offers a modern intuitive and tailored learning experience that is also consistent to what we expect and developed in our leaders. By aligning our people strategy with our business strategy, we create value now and for the long term. 
Another way to inspire team members is through promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. and ensuring that the collective voices and perspectives are heard -- and I remain the key focus of our investment in our workplace culture, and we encourage our associates to participating in employee resource groups. In the past 12 months, we have introduced 3 new ERGs and participation in ERGs has grown 88%. To further our community impact, we have elevated and strengthened our focus on supply diversity with a collaborative, data-driven and -- approach to ensure the diversity of our supplier partners and aligned of this function with our broader ESG efforts. 
Additionally, AmerisourceBergen empowers our associates to participate in and need conversations that help shape the future they want to see. For example, our associates on -- and our social justice, and AmerisourceBergen Foundation has elevated their impact by matching donation at a 2:1 ratio for organizations focused on diversity, inclusion and empowerment. I am proud that the foundation has taken new steps because I personally believe that equality is a fundamental right and that it is important to support social justice. 
Health equity has also been raised over the past year as one of the many social issues facing our societies. And here, I want to highlight the work that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy elevate provider network members on doing faster healthy communities. As transient health providers with well-established relationships in their communities, they promote health equity on a daily basis and play a major role in ensuring positive outcomes notably. Their credible work advances the national COVID-19 vaccination effort to reach all parts of the country's population quickly and efficiently. Separately, AmerisourceBergen Foundation recently made a donation to -- America to support COVID-19 vaccine education and awareness in an effort to remove barriers to vital health care access and improve the health of our communities. We are grateful and proud to have the opportunity to support healthy communities across the U.S. by partnering with nonprofit independent balances. 
Finally, the governance element of our ESG strategy is embracing a culture of transparency, ethics and integrity, which informs everything that we do and which ensures the highest standards of government. Our commitment to do the right thing is core to AmerisourceBergen's purpose and principles. By advancing environmental, social and governance initiatives, AmerisourceBergen aims to create healthier futures around the world. This is not only the right thing to do but it also enables us to further enhance the value we create for all AmerisourceBergen stakeholders. 
In closing, we remain confident in our ability to provide differentiated value to our stakeholders, leverage our leadership in specialty distribution, capitalize on our innovative mindset and benefit from our focus on strong corporate stewardship. Looking ahead, we have strong confidence in our business and are focused on closing the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which will extend our distribution capabilities into key markets and further strengthen our global platform of manufacturing services. We look forward to building upon our strong talent base with the onboarding of the [ Alliance ] health team. treating their fantastic management team, and we are excited to begin the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthy solutions. We are well positioned to create long-term stakeholder value and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our results. Jim?"

As Steve mentioned, it's hard to believe that over a year has passed since we publicly addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and AmerisourceBergen's response. Reflecting on the past year, I have been moved by the diligence our teams have shown in supporting our partners during these complex times. Our associates have lived our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and, there, the foundation of our continued performance. I am appreciative of the hard work of our associates over the past year, and I'm proud that AmerisourceBergen continues to focus on cultivating and advancing our talent and culture. 
While the pandemic presented new challenges, our long-term commitment to investing in our businesses allowed us to successfully manage through them and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model. As I said on the call this time last year, we have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. As we sit here today, with our eyes on the future, AmerisourceBergen is continuing to invest internally in our businesses and talent to ensure that AmerisourceBergen is not only delivering strong results this fiscal year but will continue to do so over the long term for differentiated value from our innovative services and solutions. 
Turning now to discuss our second quarter results. I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results, our segment performance and the updated elements of our fiscal 2021 guidance, including the increase to our EPS guidance. I will note that this updated financial guidance still does not include any contribution from the proposed Alliance Healthcare acquisition announced in January 2021. 
My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated both -- and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.53, an increase of 5% primarily due to solid operating income growth across our businesses. To reflect our continued strong performance, we are raising the bottom end of our full fiscal year EPS guidance, bringing it to a range of $8.45 to $8.60, up from a range of $8.40 to $8.60. Our consolidated revenue was $49.2 billion, up 4% driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which includes our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group of businesses. 
Consolidated gross profit increased 7% to $1.5 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 9 basis points from the prior year quarter. This gross margin improvement is due to continued growth in the sale of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies, and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses such as World Courier and MWI Animal Health. 
Regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses grew 8% year-over-year due to a number of payroll-related costs to operate in the current environment and investments and internal initiatives being made throughout fiscal 2021 with a focus on continuing to differentiate our value proposition for future growth. We are narrowing our operating expense guidance for the year from growth in the mid- to high single-digit range to growth in the high single digits. As a reminder, last year, the second half of fiscal 2020 benefited from an OpEx tailwind from lower corporate and administrative costs, notably smaller travel and lower health care expenses. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $707 million, up 5% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the increased gross profit in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization and Animal Health businesses. which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. 
Operating income margin grew 2 basis points to 1.44% as a result of the continued strong performance by our higher-margin businesses. Net interest expense was $35 million, roughly flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of new debt ahead of closing the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. The new debt is comprised of approximately $1.5 billion of senior notes due 2023, which have a coupon of 0.737% and $1 billion of senior notes due 2031, which have a coupon of 2.7%. Though we did not -- interest expense, I will note that due to the interest and fees associated with the debt raise, net interest expense will likely be up roughly 15% for the full fiscal year. Our updated fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance includes this incremental interest expense but does not include Alliance Healthcare operating income, which, of course, would be included in our future consolidated P&L after the transaction closes. 
Moving now to our effective income tax rate for the second quarter. Our tax rate was 21.9%, up from 21.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted share count was 207.3 million shares, roughly flat compared to last year's share count. We now expect our average share count for the fiscal year to be approximately  207 million to 208 million shares, up from approximately 207 million shares. The revised guidance range -- the impact of dilution from stock comp and does not reflect a share count impact of the 2 million shares that we will deliver at the close of the Alliance Healthcare transaction. 
As you begin to revisit your model, I will remind you that when we announced the Alliance acquisition. We noted that we would immediately get a period of deleveraging following the transaction close. Accordingly, and through share repurchases, we are committed to paying down over $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years to ensure AmerisourceBergen maintains a strong investment-grade credit ratings. 
Turning now to the adjusted free cash flow. Our adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $298 million, keeping us on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for the fiscal year. Regarding our cash balance, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash, including approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes that I just discussed. This completes a review of our consolidated results. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results. First, regarding the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, it is important to keep in context the environment last year in the month of March. Last year, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. This level of sales in the prior year period does have an impact on year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the quarter. 
This year, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $47.1 billion, up 3% for the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies. The growth rate may have been negatively impacted by there being 2 less business days in the current year March quarter compared to the prior year period. Segment operating income increased about 5% to $589 million with operating income margin up 1 basis point to 1.25%. We saw continued solid performance related to sales of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies and for our ION Solutions business, which continues to be a differentiator. As a reminder, the best debt reserve that we reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was originally recorded in the second quarter. The reserve and subsequent reversal both happened in fiscal 2020, therefore, resulting in a tailwind to the current quarter operating income growth and will be a headwind to operating income growth in the fourth quarter but will have no impact when comparing to full fiscal 2021 with fiscal 2020. 
Now I will turn to other, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12%, driven by growth across the 3 operating segments, particularly for World Courier. Operating income for the group was up 14% to $123 million primarily due to the continued growth and performance of World Courier and MWI. World Courier's direct-to-patient capabilities differentiate the business and have gained meaningful traction in the market as clinical trials have begun utilizing the in-home setting. Additionally, our traditional commercial offerings and industry expertise at World Courier continues to be valued by manufacturing partners, resulting in higher volumes and weight  at a time when global logistics continue to be complex. 
MWI has maintained its strong growth trajectory, particularly in the companion animal market where pet ownership has been on the rise and pet parents are paying closer attention to their pet's health. Our investments across our businesses, including a new animal health distribution center and in data analytics technologies, have allowed us to remain a best-in-class provider and offer innovative services and solutions to our partners. 
As a result of exceptional performance and strong business fundamentals and other, we are raising our operating income guidance for the group from mid- to high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth for the fiscal year. I will note that this new guidance range of low double-digit growth implies a 2-year compound annual growth rate of the group in the high single digits, helped by the continued performance of World Courier and MWI. 
Turning now to touch on the third quarter to provide some color and reminders that you build in your models. Given the continued strong performance across our business and a favorable comparison to last year, we expect revenue and gross profit to be strong and the operating expense growth rate to remain elevated. 
Below the operating income line, we expect EPS to be up only slightly in the third quarter due to 3 main factors: first, higher tax rate year-over-year as we lap discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2020; second, higher interest expense due to the debt raise; and third, higher share counts. The share repurchase is on hold as a result of the Alliance Healthcare transaction debt. We expect share count to continue to move up due to stock comp. 
At this point of the year, we are happy to have been able to raise our EPS guidance and debt, driven by the strong performance we are seeing across our business. The new EPS range represents growth of 7% to 9% versus 2020 and is clearly driven by a strong operating income growth expected in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks this morning, I will provide a brief update on the Alliance Healthcare transaction. We continue to make progress towards closing the transaction and continue to have valuable discussions with the leadership and teams at alliance in preparation for closing. We remain on track to close the acquisition by the end of our fiscal year with the possibility of closing in our fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, we expect the acquisition to generate high teens percent accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months post close. This acquisition is an important strategic and financial step into the future as it will enhance our scale and margin profile after free cash flow generation and build on our global pharmaceutical manufacturer service and distribution capabilities. 
AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to create long-term value for our commercial partners through our key differentiators of strong customer relationships, ERI and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For the first time, the report also -- with TCFD and the World Economic Forum frameworks and is presented on its own sustainability minor site. As a member of the FASB Standards Advisory Group, AmerisourceBergen's leading ESG reporting approach is featured as a case study in a recent workshop. I encourage everyone to visit the microsite and look forward to continuing to provide updates on our goals for ESG. 
I would be remiss if I did not also take a moment to highlight an important reason acknowledgment that CEO, Steve Collis and AmerisourceBergen received. In April, the -- Philadelphia presented the Americanism Award to Steve and AmerisourceBergen for commitment to -- locally across the country and the world. This award is value recognition of Steve and AmerisourceBergen living our purpose. 
In closing, AmerisourceBergen remains committed to running our business with the eye to future and will continue investing in our businesses, people and communities to serve all our stakeholders. We are building on our strengths, enhancing our differentiation in the marketplace and positioning our business for long-term growth and value creation driven by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

Let me comment on that. Those of us who have been distribution for a long time, which includes about everyone on the call and then exposed to it selling days are sorts of things that we take -- and there were 2 less selling days this quarter for AmerisourceBergen versus the same quarter last year. One was simply due to the calendar. The other was due to the fact that, this year, we did not operate our distribution centers on MLK Day, which we felt was important. And so that was why we had a second less selling day during the quarter. And so on the selling days, we probably have some impact on the revenue during the quarter. But I would say, overall, we feel quite good about the revenue growth during the quarter. We're comping against the quarter last year where there was a real uptick in revenue during the month of March during the onset of the pandemic. And so we were pleased with the revenue growth during the quarter and that we were comping against the high revenue growth quarter last year. And then also, I think, most importantly, that we're keeping our revenue growth guidance the same, which is strong in the high single-digit percent range for the fiscal year."

And I think really the key thing is we're expecting revenues to continue to be strong, GDP to continue strong, and we're expecting very solid operating income growth. So it's really the below-the-line items that are driving it, the higher tax rate year-over-year because we had a discrete tax item that benefited the third quarter of last year. We have the higher interest expense during the third quarter because we've done the Alliance acquisition financing before closing the acquisition. We have the interest expense related to it in our guidance, but of course, we won't have the Alliance operating income in our guidance until we close the deal. And then we have a slightly higher share count also. And so -- yes, so those are the kind of things that are driving what I said in the third quarter.

But that being said, moving forward, the script data will compare against past year. They had very low cold cough and flu season. There's been some lower preventative and diagnostic physician activity, but we're optimistic now. As we look to the current situation and the balance of the year that with vaccines, and a lower incidence of COVID-19 in many parts of the country, people will be scheduling these diagnostic procedures and getting referrals for physicians to treat conditions."

We expect that there will be more resumption of innovation in clinical trials. Obviously, the FDA, from our understanding, has been very focused on the pandemic and in those therapies approved. So we always do stand willing to serve. But we need to feel that our portfolio is very adequately positioned, and we don't have any specific needs or holes right now and have had a history of working with our physician customers on analytics and data mining. So we feel like we're well positioned, but It's important to keep in mind the benefits that could come from using community oncologists and particularly in clinical trial accruals, so very important."

I think you talked about a higher expense related to the Alliance financing, et cetera. But given that in the other segment, you raised the guidance there, World Courier seems to be doing quite well here. Can you talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing here and in the rest of fiscal '21? And I guess with World Courier, you've built this great infrastructure. Have you guys thought about adding more capabilities to support pharma manufacturers in the clinical trial process itself? Would you be at -- can you see yourself adding more different capabilities besides maybe the logistics piece?"

So I think the first part of your question was about kind of some of the moving pieces in guidance in general and then second part, more specifically on World Courier. And I think one of the key thing is that we are seeing positive trends across our businesses, particularly in our higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing the really strong execution across our businesses, both in pharmaceuticals, distribution and in the commercialization and Animal Health businesses. So some of these positive trends we're seeing is, of course, and continued very good performance in specialty physician services. We're seeing strong performance also in health systems. And then as you've called out and other, we're seeing strong growth in both the World Courier business and the MWI businesses. And we expect to see positive trends there in those businesses for the rest of the year. And beyond these overall positive trends, there are a number of moving pieces that we talked about in the prepared remarks and on this call, we're beginning to lap some significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization. And so the operating income from biosimilars will continue to grow probably not at the same percentage growth rates that we saw as utilization was really increasing during the last 3 quarters of last year and the first quarter of this fiscal year. 
Our guidance, as I said, does assume that COVID therapy sales will be lower in the second half than they were in the first half. And of course, we're very proud of what we're doing there. And it is good that we do feel that. Of course, utilization of COVID therapies we do feel will be lower in the second half. And then we're lapping part of the fiscal year that had very low expense growth at the back half of last year. We had -- in the back half of last year, we had less than 1% operating expense growth, so we're lapping that operating expense growth. We also have a 6 months of interest associated with the Alliance Healthcare transaction. And so those are some of the things that are impacting our guidance. But overall, we feel very good about the positive trends and execution across our businesses. And Steve, is there anything that you want to add there?"

An example we give you is just what -- with India, where we were able to facilitate the shipment of important and invested products for India really using the capabilities of World Courier because there is such a high capability, highly targeted niche area that we continue to find us as far. I also do believe that part of our synergy thesis is looking at the combination of World Courier and Alliance Healthcare in different markets, just having more of a footprint, more presence. I do believe that there, of course, is going to be another strong additive characteristic for World Courier's opportunities in the future"

Overall, the deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years regarding generic deflation And as I said, and as you noted, there have been a few product-specific pockets of pressure, but overall, the rate is still relatively in line with our expectations for the year. Supply and demand dynamics remain balanced. And the balance of the year, we expect overall deflation to be generally consistent with year-to-date. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

It's hard to believe that 1 year ago on this call, I braced for the first time how AmerisourceBergen was responding to global COVID-19 pandemic. There were many uncertainties said about how COVID-19 will impact our lives, our families and our communities. Part of our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, AmerisourceBergen enacted decisively to protect and support our associates, maintain business continuity and help our customers navigate increased complexity. Our people and businesses prove resilient and the pharmaceutical distribution industry demonstrated its vital role as a key for that in the health care system. I remain incredibly proud and inspired by where our associates and teams have adapted and innovated to support our [indiscernible] needs and facilitate patient exit. Powered by our talent and culture, enabled by a robust infrastructure and technology, AmerisourceBergen is providing value-added data-driven solutions to empower our partners with channel awareness and solutions. Importantly, our differentiated capability enable us to continue to support pharmaceutical innovation and the pandemic response both in the U.S. and increasingly abroad. This role is important for our people, our communities and our partners and embodies our purpose by operating value for all our stakeholders.  
Turning now to our quarterly financial results. As we announced earlier this morning, AmerisourceBergen delivered year-over-year growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues were $49 billion, representing growth of 4% from the same period last year, and our adjusted EPS grew 5% year-over-year. These results were driven by strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty, innovative services and solutions, our purpose-driven culture that unites us in our responsibility to create healthier futures.  
One way that we are living our purpose is our leading role though providing COVID-19 support going. In the U.S., we continue to distribute the antiviral and antibody therapies to health systems across the country. Through our work with the strategic national stockpile, we are supporting government preparedness for current and future potential pharmaceutical needs. Members of our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network are providing vaccine access  in their communities as we facilitate their participation in the federal retail pharmacy program. The efforts are especially important in the nationwide inoculation movement because their role as highly trusted medical professionals in the communities enables them to quickly, efficiently and definitively serve local hard-to-reach priority populations.  
Outside the United States, we continue to play an active role in global vaccination efforts. In Canada, for example, our [ NMR ] business is working in partnership with FedEx to distribute the COVID-19 backseat on behalf of the Canadian government. As I mentioned earlier, AmerisourceBergen is focused on providing value-added services and innovative customer-centric solutions. And that focus has only been amplified throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our associates are facilitating an efficient and resilient supply chain to ensure patients have access to the critical medication [indiscernible]. In support of pharmaceutical innovation, we are providing key commercialization and distribution solutions for our partners to help them adapt to the current dynamic environment. We are leveraging our leadership in specialty distribution and services to further enhance our differentiated value proposition for our partners. Those includes expanding our robust suite of specialty capability and data and analytic solutions to further solidify our position as a partner of choice and essential for supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access.  
Just so fastly, we are able to leverage the full, breadth of AmerisourceBergen's capabilities, including our logistical expertise and efficient execution to be a solution provider for public and private partners. Working with the U.S. government and our manufacturer partner, we were able to facilitate the transportation of antiviral therapies to India. I am both honored and humbled that we were able to build our purpose in this part of need around the world. 
The standard would not have been possible with our World Courier business, a key global specialty logistics partner. World Korea continues to support the innovation of manufacturers as they now navigate logistical foundations. The importance of World Courier expertise has never been [indiscernible] and over the past year as our partner shifted to perform more clinical trials at patient homes through our industry-leading direct-to-patient capabilities, given the challenges of interfacing with patients and traditional [indiscernible]. World Courier's unparalleled logistical services, combined with partnerships have enabled a broad network of field-based services and proven invaluable keeping clinical trials moving forward. 
Our teams have been adaptable and creative as they provide solutions to facilitate better outcomes for the communities and patients that our partners serve. Our MWI Animal Health business also continued its strong performance this quarter, thanks to its strong manufacturer and provider relationships as well as its ability to facilitate better help for both companion and production animals. To support the continued growth of the MWI business and further our operational efficiency, we recently opened a new standard [indiscernible] animal health distribution center in the U.S. This new facility bolsters our animal health distribution network and enhances our service capabilities for  veterinarians and other animal health care providers nationwide. AmerisourceBergen's continued ability to provide differentiated value to our customers and partners and deliver on our promise of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures is enhanced by our ability to execute on our core growth strategies. 
First, we remain focused on our customers, one of our core differentiators with our portfolio of key anchor customers across each segment of our business. This customer base enables us to lead with market leaders and facilitate patient access wherever prescription is needed. We intend to continue to strengthen our key customer relationships and enhance our customer-centric solutions globally.  
Second, we will continue to build upon our leadership concessions. We have the strongest portfolio of customer relationships and value-added services in the industry, which enables us to advance and benefit on pharmaceutical innovation, enhancing our capabilities in specialty to support both our upstream partners and downstream customers, makes an important area of focus for AmerisourceBergen.  
Third, we continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service and developing innovative approaches to better service our customers. By embracing advanced technology data and analytics, we provide solution-oriented and value-added innovations and enable all our customers to grow, this time into our first growth strategies because when our customers grow, we grow.  
Fourth, we seek to enable positive prescription pharmaceutical outcomes globally by facilitating market access and supporting pharmaceutical innovation by providing value-added services that facilitate commercialization as well as innovative solutions to facilitate patient access on top of our unparalleled scale and expertise, we are able to get therapies to small and large patient populations. This approach enables partnerships that unlock our potential and move health forward.  
Our associates remain key to our success, and our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion as well as investments in our deepening culture have long been pivotal in advancing these growth strategies and positioning AmerisourceBergen for long-term success. Our strategy and culture are foundational to reinforcing our legacy of strong corporate [indiscernible], which focuses on bringing people first and ensuring the continued financial health of our businesses by creating long-term value for all our stakeholders.  
To ensure that the value we create is sustainable, we are embedding ESG principles into our culture, businesses and processes [indiscernible] to our overall growth strategy. Our environmental strategy focuses on adapting to a change in climate and advancing a resilient and responsible supply chain. We are leveraging our infrastructure and technology to create an efficient and secure pharmaceutical supply chain that also allows us to reduce waste, lower our global carbon footprint and prepare for unexpected events.  
For example, we collaborate with our partners and customers to create packaging and transportation efficiencies that result in significant process, cost and environmental improvements. We also understand our climate-related physical risks and have a robust business continuity  plan in place to ensure we can continue to deliver life-saving medications. On the social side, our strategy is centered around corporate responsibility and focused on investing in our people and communities to inspire our team members and foster healthy communities. We continue now, as we have throughout the pandemic, to ensure we protect and assist our associates and their families with enhanced [indiscernible] additional bonuses, physical and mental health resources and childcare and medicare benefits as part of our strong benefit programs, which now include extended paid parental leave.  
For our frontline associates, we have remained an additional important [indiscernible] such as enhanced cleaning protocols, social distancing protections and providing them with PPE. For the long term, we advanced our talent and culture by investing in the development of our people. By these investments is a new leadership competency model and development programs, supported by world class learning technology. Added then by our purpose and. guiding principles, the program focuses our leaders on creating an energized, diverse and inclusive workplace, leveraging collaboration to create and realize new opportunities, innovating and executing to prepare for the future with creative resourcefulness and being action-based to rapidly adapt to our dynamic landscape. To help all our associates unlock their full potential and empower them to reach their career goals, we've also launched a new enterprise learning model that offers a modern intuitive and tailored learning experience that is also consistent to what we expect and develop in our leaders. By aligning our people strategy with our business strategy, we create value now and for the long term. 
Another way to inspire team members is through promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. and ensuring that the collective voices and perspectives are heard -- and I remain the key focus of our investment in our workplace culture, and we encourage our associates to participating in employee resource groups. In the past 12 months, we have introduced 3 new ERGs and participation in ERGs has grown 88%. To further our community impact, we have elevated and strengthened our focus on supply diversity with a collaborative, data-driven and [thoughtful] approach to ensure the diversity of our supplier partners and aligned with this function with our broader ESG efforts. 
Additionally, AmerisourceBergen empowers our associates to participate in and need conversations that help shape the future they want to see. For example, our associates on [indiscernible] and our social justice, and AmerisourceBergen Foundation has elevated their impact by matching donation at a 2:1 ratio for organizations focused on diversity, inclusion and empowerment. I am proud that the foundation has taken new steps because I personally believe that equality is a fundamental right and that it is important to support social justice. 
Health equity has also been raised over the past year as one of the many social issues facing our societies. And here, I want to highlight the work that our Good Neighbor Pharmacy innovate provider network members on doing faster healthy communities. As transient health providers with well-established relationships in their communities, they promote health equity on a daily basis and play a major role in ensuring positive outcomes [locally]. Their credible work advances the national COVID-19 vaccination effort to reach all parts of the country's population quickly and efficiently. 
Separately, AmerisourceBergen Foundation recently made a donation to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to support COVID-19 vaccine education and awareness, in an effort to remove barriers to vital health care access and improve the health of our communities. We are grateful and proud to have the opportunity to support healthy communities across the U.S. by partnering with nonprofit independent pharmacies.
Finally, the government element of our ESG strategy is embracing a culture of transparency, ethics and integrity, which informs everything that we do and which ensures the highest standards of government. Our commitment to do the right thing is core to AmerisourceBergen's purpose and principles. By advancing environmental, social and governance initiatives, AmerisourceBergen aims to create healthier futures around the world. This is not only the right thing to do but it also enables us to further enhance the value we create for all AmerisourceBergen stakeholders. 
In closing, we remain confident in our ability to provide differentiated value to our stakeholders, leverage our leadership in specialty distribution, capitalize on our innovative mindset and benefit from our focus on strong corporate stewardship. Looking ahead, we have strong confidence in our business and are focused on closing the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which will extend our distribution capabilities into key markets and further strengthen our global platform of manufacturing services. 
We look forward to building upon our strong talent base with the onboarding of the Alliance health team, treating their fantastic management team, and we are excited to begin the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthy solutions. We are well-positioned to create long-term stakeholder value and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our results. Jim?"

As Steve mentioned, it's hard to believe that over a year has passed since we publicly addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and AmerisourceBergen's response. Reflecting on the past year, I have been moved by the diligence our teams have shown in supporting our partners during these complex times. Our associates have lived our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and, there, the foundation of our continued performance. I am appreciative of the hard work of our associates over the past year, and I'm proud that AmerisourceBergen continues to focus on cultivating and advancing our talent and culture. 
While the pandemic presented new challenges, our long-term commitment to investing in our businesses allowed us to successfully manage through them and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model. As I said on the call this time last year, we have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. As we sit here today, with our eyes on the future, AmerisourceBergen is continuing to invest internally in our businesses and talent to ensure that AmerisourceBergen is not only delivering strong results this fiscal year but will continue to do so over the long term for differentiated value from our innovative services and solutions. 
Turning now to discuss our second quarter results. I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results, our segment performance and the updated elements of our fiscal 2021 guidance, including the increase to our EPS guidance. I will note that this updated financial guidance still does not include any contribution from the proposed Alliance Healthcare acquisition announced in January 2021. 
My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated both -- and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.53, an increase of 5%, primarily due to solid operating income growth across our businesses. To reflect our continued strong performance, we are raising the bottom end of our full fiscal year EPS guidance, bringing it to a range of $8.45 to $8.60, up from a range of $8.40 to $8.60. Our consolidated revenue was $49.2 billion, up 4%, driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which includes our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group of businesses. 
Consolidated gross profit increased 7% to $1.5 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 9 basis points from the prior year quarter. This gross margin improvement is due to continued growth in the sale of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies, and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses such as World Courier and MWI Animal Health. 
Regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses grew 8% year-over-year due to a number of payroll-related costs to operate in the current environment and investments, and internal initiatives being made throughout fiscal 2021, with a focus on continuing to differentiate our value proposition for future growth. We are narrowing our operating expense guidance for the year from growth in the mid- to high single-digit range to growth in the high single digits. As a reminder, last year, the second half of fiscal 2020 benefited from an OpEx tailwind from lower corporate and administrative costs, notably lower travel and lower health care expenses. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $707 million, up 5% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the increased gross profit in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization and Animal Health businesses, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. 
Operating income margin grew 2 basis points to 1.44% as a result of the continued strong performance by our higher-margin businesses. Net interest expense was $35 million, roughly flat year-over-year. During the quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of new debt ahead of closing the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. The new debt is comprised of approximately $1.5 billion of senior notes due 2023, which have a coupon of 0.737% and $1 billion of senior notes due 2031, which have a coupon of 2.7%. 
Though we did not [indiscernible] interest expense, I will note that due to the interest and fees associated with the debt raise, net interest expense will likely be up roughly 15% for the full fiscal year. Our updated fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance includes this incremental interest expense but does not include Alliance Healthcare operating income, which, of course, would be included in our future consolidated P&L after the transaction closes. 
Moving now to our effective income tax rate for the second quarter. Our tax rate was 21.9%, up from 21.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted share count was 207.3 million shares, roughly flat compared to last year's share count. We now expect our average share count for the fiscal year to be approximately 207 million to 208 million shares, up from approximately 207 million shares. The revised guidance range [ for testing ] impact of dilution from stock comp and does not reflect a share count impact of the 2 million shares that we will deliver at the close of the Alliance Healthcare transaction. 
As you begin to revisit your model, I will remind you that when we announced the Alliance acquisition, we noted that we would immediately get a period of deleveraging following the transaction close. Accordingly, and through share repurchases, we are committed to paying down over $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years to ensure AmerisourceBergen maintains a strong investment-grade credit ratings. 
Turning now to the adjusted free cash flow. Our adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $298 million, keeping us on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for the fiscal year. Regarding our cash balance. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash, including approximately $2.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes that I just discussed. This completes the review of our consolidated results. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results. First, regarding the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, it is important to keep in context the environment last year in the month of March. Last year, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. This elevated level of sales in the prior year period does have an impact on year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the quarter. 
This year, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $47.1 billion, up 3% for the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies. The growth rate may have been negatively impacted by there being 2 less business days in the current year March quarter compared to the prior year period. Segment operating income increased about 5% to $589 million with operating income margin up 1 basis point to 1.25%. We saw continued solid performance related to sales of specialty products, including COVID-19 therapies and for our ION Solutions business, which continues to be a differentiator. As a reminder, the bad debt reserve that we reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was originally recorded in the second quarter. The reserve and subsequent reversal both happened in fiscal 2020, therefore, resulting in a tailwind to the current quarter operating income growth and will be a headwind to operating income growth in the fourth quarter, but will have no impact when comparing to full fiscal 2021 with fiscal 2020. 
Now I will turn to Other, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12%, driven by growth across the 3 operating segments, particularly for World Courier. Operating income for the group was up 14% to $123 million, primarily due to the continued growth and performance of World Courier and MWI. World Courier's direct-to-patient capabilities differentiate the business and have gained meaningful traction in the market as clinical trials have begun utilizing the in-home setting. Additionally, our traditional commercial offerings and industry expertise at World Courier continue to be valued by manufacturing partners, resulting in higher volumes and weight, in a time when global logistics continue to be complex. 
MWI has maintained its strong growth trajectory, particularly in the companion animal market where pet ownership has been on the rise and pet parents are paying closer attention to their pet's health. Our investments across our businesses, including the new animal health distribution center and in data analytics technologies, have allowed us to remain a best-in-class provider and offer innovative services and solutions to our partners. 
As a result of exceptional performance and strong business fundamentals in other, we are raising our operating income guidance for the group from mid- to high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth for the fiscal year. I will note that this new guidance range of low double-digit growth implies a 2-year compound annual growth rate of the group in the high single digits, helped by the continued performance of World Courier and MWI. 
Turning now to touch on the third quarter to provide some color and reminders that you build in your models. Given the continued strong performance across our business and a favorable comparison to last year, we expect revenue and gross profit to be strong and the operating expense growth rate to remain elevated. 
Below the operating income line, we expect EPS to be up only slightly in the third quarter due to 3 main factors: first, higher tax rate year-over-year as we lap discrete items in the third quarter of fiscal 2020; second, higher interest expense due to the debt raise; and third, higher share counts. The share repurchase is on hold as a result of the Alliance Healthcare transaction debt. We expect share count to continue to move up due to stock comp. 
At this point of the year, we are happy to have been able to raise our EPS guidance and debt, driven by the strong performance we are seeing across our business. The new EPS range represents growth of 7% to 9% versus 2020 and is clearly driven by a strong operating income growth expected in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks this morning, I will provide a brief update on the Alliance Healthcare transaction. We continue to make progress towards closing the transaction and continue to have valuable discussions with the leadership and teams at Alliance in preparation for closing. We remain on track to close the acquisition by the end of our fiscal year, with the possibility of closing in our fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, we expect the acquisition to generate high teens percent accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months post close. This acquisition is an important strategic and financial step into the future as it will enhance our scale and margin profile after free cash flow generation and build on our global pharmaceutical manufacturer service and distribution capabilities. 
AmerisourceBergen is well-positioned to create long-term value for our commercial partners through our key differentiators of strong customer relationships, leadership and specialty and our commitment to innovation. We are also continuing to build on our corporate stewardship to ensure the value we create benefits all of our stakeholders.
As executive co-sponsor of ESG Council, I'm excited by this quarter's release of our fifth annual Global Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report, which aligned with Global Sustainability Frameworks, including [indiscernible] GRI and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For the first time, the report also aligns with TCFD and the World Economic Forum frameworks and is presented on its own sustainability micro site. As a member of the FASB Standards Advisory Group, AmerisourceBergen's leading ESG reporting approach is featured as a case study in a recent workshop. I encourage everyone to visit the microsite and look forward to continuing to provide updates on our goals for ESG. 
I would be remiss if I did not also take a moment to highlight an important reason acknowledgment that CEO, Steve Collis and AmerisourceBergen, received. In April, the Anti-Defamation League Philadelphia presented the Americanism Award to Steve and AmerisourceBergen for commitment to fighting locally across the country and the world. This award is value recognition of Steve and AmerisourceBergen living our purpose. 
In closing, AmerisourceBergen remains committed to running our business with the eye to the future and will continue investing in our businesses, people and communities to serve all our stakeholders. We are building on our strengths, enhancing our differentiation in the marketplace and positioning our business for long-term growth and value creation, driven by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

Let me comment on that. Those of us who have been distribution for a long time, which includes about everyone on the call and then exposed to it selling days are sorts of things that we tend to -- and there were 2 less selling days this quarter for AmerisourceBergen versus the same quarter last year. One was simply due to the calendar. The other was due to the fact that, this year, we did not operate our distribution centers on MLK Day, which we felt was important. And so that was why we had a second less selling day during the quarter. And so on the selling days, we probably have some impact on the revenue during the quarter. But anyways, I would say, overall, we feel quite good about the revenue growth during the quarter. We're comping against the quarter last year where there was a real uptick in revenue during the month of March, during the onset of the pandemic. And so we were pleased with the revenue growth during the quarter and that we were comping against the high revenue growth quarter last year. And then also, I think, most importantly, that we're keeping our revenue growth guidance the same, which is strong in the high single-digit percent range for the fiscal year."

And I think really the key thing is we're expecting revenues to continue to be strong, GDP continue strong, and we're expecting very solid operating income growth. So it's really the below-the-line items that are driving it, the higher tax rate year-over-year because we had a discrete tax item that benefited the third quarter of last year. We have the higher interest expense during the third quarter because we've done the Alliance acquisition financing before closing the acquisition. So we have the interest expense related to it in our guidance, but of course, we won't have the Alliance operating income in our guidance until we close the deal. And then we have a slightly higher share count also. And so -- yes, so those are the kind of things that are driving what I said in the third quarter.

So we feel like we're well-positioned, but it's important to keep in mind the benefits that could come from using community oncologists and particularly in clinical trial accruals, so very important."

James, I want to talk about a follow-up with the question from Lisa, when you talked about the puts and takes on the rest of the guidance here and with some of the offsets. I think you talked about a higher expense related to the Alliance financing, et cetera. But given that in the other segment, you raised the guidance there, World Courier seems to be doing quite well here. Can you talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing here and in the rest of fiscal '21? And I guess with World Courier, you've built this great infrastructure. Have you guys thought about adding more capabilities to support pharma manufacturers in the clinical trial process itself? Would you be at -- can you see yourself adding more different capabilities besides maybe the logistics piece?"

And I think one of the key thing is that we are seeing positive trends acros",388,"Yes. Sure. So I think the first part of your question was about kind of some of the moving pieces in guidance in general and then second part, more specifically on World Courier. And I think one of the key thing is that we are seeing positive trends across our businesses, particularly in our higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing the really strong execution across our businesses, both in pharmaceuticals, distribution and in the debt commercialization and Animal Health businesses. It's a combination of all these positive trends we're seeing is, of course, and continued very good performance in specialty physician services. We're seeing strong performance also in health systems. And then as you've called out in Other, we're seeing strong growth in both the World Courier business and the MWI businesses. And we expect to see positive trends there in those businesses for the rest of the year. And beyond these overall positive trends, there are a number of moving pieces that we talked about in the prepared remarks and on this call. We're beginning to lap some significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization. And so the operating income from biosimilars will continue to grow probably not at the same percentage growth rates that we saw as utilization was really increasing during the last 3 quarters of last year and the first quarter of this fiscal year. 
Our guidance, as I said, does assume that COVID therapy sales will be lower in the second half than they were in the first half. And of course, we're very proud of what we're doing there. And it is good that we do feel that. Of course, utilization of COVID therapies we do feel will be lower in the second half. And then we're lapping part of the fiscal year that had very low expense growth at the back half of last year. We had, in fact, out of last year, we had less than 1% operating expense growth, so we're lapping that operating expense growth. We also have a 6 months of interest associated with the Alliance Healthcare transaction. And so those are some of the things that are impacting our guidance. But overall, we feel very good about the positive trends and execution across our businesses. And Steve, is there anything that you want to add there?"

I also do believe that part of our synergy thesis is looking at the combination of World Courier and Alliance Healthcare in different markets, just having more of a footprint, more presence. I do believe that there, of course, is going to be another strong additive around characteristic for World Courier's opportunities in the future."

And so while we don't have specific guidance and metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. Overall, the deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years regarding generic deflation. And as I said, and as you noted, there have been a few product-specific pockets of pressure, but overall, the rate is still relatively in line with our expectations for the year. Supply and demand dynamics remain balanced. And the balance of the year, we expect overall deflation to be generally consistent with year-to-date. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

Of course, most of the media's attention would be focused on the high outbreak areas, and we've seen this unfortunately play out in other areas. Now just to point to a few mitigating factors here.

Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proponent settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. paid attorneys generals and political subdivisions in participating states. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to address the normalcy of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, [indiscernible] an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to close with stakeholders concerning these complex matters.
AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and alongside partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis to the communities where we live, work and serve. 
Turning now to our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. AmerisourceBergen delivered yet another quarter of exceptional results driven by a high level of execution, purpose-minded team members and continued focus on delivering differentiated value. As we announced earlier this morning, we had revenues of over $33 billion representing growth of 18% from the same period last year, and we grew our adjusted EPS by 17% year-over-year. These results reflect continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses as we capitalize on our differentiated pharmaceutical-centric value proposition and our team successfully executed on our key strategic initiatives. This strength and execution continue to create value for our shareholders. And today, we are again raising our fiscal 2021 full year guidance, which Jim will discuss later in greater detail. I will focus my remarks today on the key strategic pillars that are driving our strong performance as well as how, with the addition of Alliance Healthcare, AmerisourceBergen continues to be well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders. AmerisourceBergen remains next minded, and we are focused on continuing to enhance our ability to provide global health care solutions as we support pharmaceutical innovation and access, both in the United States and internationally. 
In the United States, our pharmaceutical distribution business continues to benefit from our industry-leading customer relationships, our leadership in specialty distribution and commercialization services and strong end market trends, including an earlier than expected return to pre-COVID prescription utilization frames in the June quarter. Our leading customer base includes our Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Provider Network members. They are proving day that community partners are at the forefront of providing quality and equitable care and maintaining deep levels of trust with their patients and communities. 
In fact, for the fifth year in a row Good Neighbor Pharmacy was ranked highest amongst brick and mortar chain drug store pharmacies by JD Power. This is the tenth time we have received on it in the past 12 years and it is a testament to community awareness of the value of the quality of care and experienced patients received at GMP member pharmacies. We held our annual for sport conference last week, and I was touched and inspired by the stories that our members shared through the entrepreneurship, expertise and deep community routes, community pharmacies prove that they do more than just for prescriptions. They are critical promoters of health equity for U.S. often doing a bad and beyond to provide holistic care and health education at the local level, particularly in under-resourced communities. 
Since beginning of the pandemic, community pharmacies have stepped up fearlessly to meet the unprecedented challenges of a global health crisis and show the world while community pharmacies are integral to our communities. 
The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer. Another relevant example is on the animal side. The growth in pet ownership has increased demand for our veterinarian customers as pets are a cherished of the family and the care of veterinarian provides its value. This positive trend over the last year has long-term benefits for our business as MWI is well positioned with key anchor customers and services. 
On the human health side, access to local trusted expertise care remains final, particularly for those dealing with complex health challenges they bring them into the care of specialty physician providers. 
As I've said from the onset of the pandemic, we are conscious of the negative impact that restricted measures have on patients when they have less access to screenings and tests that help doctors identify serious health issues. This is particularly impacted patients who are used to a doctor or health care facility. But now our customers have begun to see a normalization in new patient trends. And as a result, patients are more effectively being diagnosed in gaining access to treatment. This is clear positive for patient care. 
As the leading provider of specialty distribution and commercialization services, we will continue to play our role in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access as patients visit volumes continues to normalize. Our specialty physician services business had strong performance this quarter and continues to differentiate AmerisourceBergen with leading value-added services, such as those through our physician POs. Additionally, buyer centers continue to be a positive for our customers, our business and the health care system overall as they provide room for new innovative products to come to market. 
The innovations in CAR-T and cell and gene therapies and the potential applications of the new mRNA technology offers a medical community new potential tools in the treatment of serious diseases that previously alluded, truly effective care. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support all these innovations through our specialty distribution and manufacturer services offerings. Our unique ability to provide value-added expertise in conjunction with innovative solutions and quality service enhance our partnerships and grow our business. 
With strong partnerships, relationships and a leading portfolio of solutions to support a wide pipeline of practices and products, AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities provided by global pharmaceutical innovation as we drive growth in our business. and help our partners tackle some of the most critical challenges based in health care. 
We have a strong foundation in place across our businesses. And in June, we took another significant step forward by closing the Alliance Healthcare transaction and welcoming their talented team to the AmerisourceBergen family. The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare is the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global health solutions and is a critical component to our future success. 
Alliance Healthcare is a strong and diversified pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services company with leading market positions across an attractive portfolio of both established European markets and high-growth emerging markets. 
In addition to their traditional wholesale business, Alliance Healthcare operates a range of leading higher-margin innovation businesses serving both upstream partners and downstream customers. The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare extends our distribution reach built by our market-leading services capabilities and expands on our key differentiators. 
Specifically, AmerisourceBergen's leading portfolio of key anchor customers now includes a long-term relationship with Boots in the U.K. and a network of independent pharmacies across Europe through our [indiscernible] pharmacy network. Since the completion of the transaction, we have gotten the chance to know the business and the people and aligned health care better, and we remained very positive about the opportunity that this landmark achievement provides AmerisourceBergen as we are positioned for a differentiated global growth platform. This includes our dedication to further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships to lead with market leaders in every segment and to supporting patient access wherever a prescription is needed. 
Second, AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty is further enhanced with key commercialization services in markets. By leveraging the expertise and capabilities of our World Courier business, along with Alliance Healthcare, we elevate our ability to be a differentiated solution provider for global manufacturers as they develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals around the world. This is complementary to the solutions that we provide World Courier, which continues to play a key role of providing global specialty logistics through growth traditional commercial offerings and direct-to-patient clinical trial capabilities. We remain dedicated to expanding on our leadership in specialty and to enhancing our capabilities to support global pharmaceutical innovation. 
Third, AmerisourceBergen focuses on delivering best-in-class services and efficiency, and this transaction enhances our ability to develop innovation solutions that are fundamental to our success operationally and commercially. Our innovative mindset means that we embrace the advanced technologies, data and analytics and now, we can further support positive outcomes through our expanded global platform. 
This fiscal quarter, we were selected as the industry leader of wall winner at the 2021 SAP Innovation Awards for our work in developing SAP advanced track and trace for pharmaceuticals. This technology tracks millions of daily shipments at the batch level and further strengthens the pharmaceutical supply chain in the U.S. 
The value of a resilient and sustainable global pharmaceutical supply chain is vital and the ability to support pharmaceutical innovation to a global footprint with broad leadership and local expertise provide differentiated value for our partners. AmerisourceBergen stakeholders recognize the value we create, the importance of our purpose and the critical nature of the service and the infrastructure that we provide. 
Fourth, AmerisourceBergen continues to build upon our history of corporate stewardship, which focuses on advancing our people and culture, protecting the company's financial health and ensuring the long-term sustainable value creation. 
With Alliance Healthcare, we are now even more global [indiscernible] company, and we are committed more than ever to advancing the value of our tenants and culture. Over the past year, we have invested in enhancing our talent and diversity and inclusion strategies to enable more growth opportunities within our increasingly inclusive workplace. We recently launched our executive leadership initiative to accelerate the advancement and ongoing success of high potential black, Hispanic and Latin X team members at the mid and senior levels addressing the most pronounced leadership and representation gaps identified over the last several months, following best-in-class research-based approaches. 
In the future, we plan to provide detailed development opportunities for high-potential employees of additional underrepresented groups. Investing in our leadership development and talent and culture is important to our long-term sustainable growth, which is supported by the [indiscernible] and inclusive teams. This focus is important to ensuring we capture the value of our collective differences and reflect our social commitment as we continue to strategically focus on delivering on all elements for ESG. Our ESG strategy is foundational to AmerisourceBergen, our leadership, our Board and our people. Recently, AmerisourceBergen joined the science-based targets initiative as we continue to align our business with best practice organizations around the world. At the local level, we continue to be deeply committed to our communities. 
This past year, we launched My Community Impact matching gifts and dollar for U.S. program, and we recently remained available to all global employees. Our philanthropic efforts have been recognized by diversity in [indiscernible] Aids in their annual [indiscernible] based in philanthropy brandies. 
As I closed m compared remarks today, I remain truly inspired by the commitment and performance of our team members who are now number 41,000.

24809,1671862083,2362267,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I want to comment on the pharmaceutical distribution industries continued progress towards reaching a negotiated resolution to substantially address the nationwide opioid l",2207,"Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I want to comment on the pharmaceutical distribution industries continued progress towards reaching a negotiated resolution to substantially address the nationwide opioid litigation. The proposed settlement agreement represents an important step towards achieving a broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and aligns with the legal accrual the company recorded in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
AmerisourceBergen appreciates the enormity of the opioid epidemic, and this broad interest rate resolution is an important step towards delivering a meaningful relief to communities across the United States. 
Turning now to our business. AmerisourceBergen remains focused on our differentiated and innovative proposition to deliver long-term growth and value creation to our stakeholders, powered by our purpose-driven team members, we will continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, our enhanced global platform to serve both upstream partners and downstream customers. 
As we recently completed the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare in the quarter, I would like to welcome the Alliance Healthcare team to AmerisourceBergen. Having joined AmerisourceBergen myself through an acquisition and experienced several acquisitions during my tenure, I have seen firsthand a thoughtful and strategic approach AmerisourceBergen takes to successfully integrate acquired companies. We enjoy working with our incredibly talented new team members and learning more, not only about their businesses, but also about how much we culturally have in common. 
As we have said since announcing the acquisition, Alliance Healthcare as a strong and efficient business, and we look forward to working together to continue to provide innovative solutions to our customers and stakeholders. 
My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I love the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. 
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.16, an increase of 17%, which was driven by the continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses and also benefited from the 1-month contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our consolidated revenue was $53.4 billion, up 18%, driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which includes Alliance Healthcare and our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health businesses. Consolidated gross profit increased 32% to $1.6 billion driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. 
In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 33 basis points from the prior year quarter to 3.05%. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which has a higher gross profit margin and increase in sales of specialty products in Pharmaceutical Distribution services, and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses. 
Regarding consolidated operating expenses were $996 million, up 38% year-over-year due to the addition of the Alliance Healthcare business and also includes the internal investments we are making across our business with a focus on continuing to offer innovative services and solutions to our partners. These investments are important as they ensure we continue to create differentiated value and support our long-term growth. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $631 million, up 24% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin grew 6 basis points to 1.18% as a result of the contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth in higher-margin businesses. 
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter. The net interest expense was $51 million, up 36% due to debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our effective income tax rate was 21%, up from 18.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which benefited from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count was 208.9 million shares, a 1.6% increase due to the dilution related to employee comp and the weighted average saving impact of the June issuance of 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as a part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. 
Turning now to adjusted free cash flow and cash. Our adjusted free cash flow was strong in our fiscal third quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow number to $1.2 billion, while our cash balance was $2.6 billion. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $49.3 billion, up 13% for the quarter driven by increased sales of specialty products and solid performance broadly across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses. 
Across our distribution businesses, we are seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends as there have been more normalized physician interaction leading to new patient starts. 
Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased about 13% to $484 million. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit in the quarter from our leadership in specialty where there has been a notable return to pre-COVID strength and continued positive biosimilar trends. 
I will now turn to other, which includes Alliance Healthcare MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. Alliance Healthcare is in our results for the month of June and had strong performance out of the gate. 
In the quarter, other segment revenue was $4.1 billion, up 128%, driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth across the remaining operating segments. Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, global commercialization services And Animal health revenue was up 22%. Other segment's operating income was $147 million, up 77% primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and strong performance at both MWI and World Courier. Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, global commercialization services and animal health operating income was up 21%, reflecting the solid fundamentals of the businesses. 
World Courier has continued its exceptional performance, providing high-touch specialty logistics around the globe. Despite challenges in global logistics due to limited international cargo space, the team has delivered industry-leading solutions and expertise to support our customers and partners. 
Looking ahead, the business is highly complementary to Alliance Healthcare's Alloga and Alcura businesses. and we are excited to offer an integrated suite of solutions on our enhanced global platform to serve our manufacturer customers. 
Turning now to MWI. The pandemic has truly encouraged all of us to focus on the health and well-being of our communities and families. And this includes our animal companions. Over 12 million families in the U.S. have gained test since the pandemia began and since pet owners view their pets as family members the focus on health and well-being is a positive market trend for our MWI companion business. 
In the production animal market, our investments in technology solutions and the unique offering of value managed services, position the business to support long-term global demand for protein. MWI's strong execution and customer relationships have allowed the business to remain a best-in-class provider that is well positioned to capture these positive market trends. 
That concludes our segment level discussion, and I will now turn to our 2020 guidance. Following the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition back in June, we updated our 2021 guidance for revenue, adjusted diluted EPS and weighted average shares to reflect the expected contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the weighted average share count impacted the 2 million shares of stock that we delivered to Walgreens. 
Given the continued strong performance of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, we are again raising our EPS guidance from a range of $8.90 to $9.10, up to a range of $9.15 to $9.30, reflecting growth of 16% to 18% from the previous fiscal year. We are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021, including a meaningful increase to our expectations for consolidated and segment adjusted operating income. 
First, I'll begin with operating expenses. Operating expenses are now expected to be approximately $3.9 billion due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. 
As a reminder, when you consider your models, Alliance Healthcare has higher margins for gross profit, operating expenses and operating income as evidenced by the update to our fiscal 2021 guidance for consolidated operating expenses to reflect the 4 months of Alliance Healthcare. 
Next, turning to operating income. We now expect operating income to be approximately $2.6 billion. This is a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the low double-digit growth range given the strong trends we have continued to see in our business, including specialty, which was further bolstered by patient referral activity this quarter. 
This rate also reflects our expectation for operating income and other of approximately $610 million to $620 million. Excluding the contribution from Alliance Healthcare, operating income growth for global commercialization services and animal health group is expected to be in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2021 driven by the strong performance of the World Courier and MWI. 
Finally, turning to free cash flow, we have raised our free cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.7 billion, up from approximately $1.5 billion. As it pertains to fiscal 2022, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of our current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process. 
That being said, we want to remind you of 3 important items from fiscal 2021 as you can see in your models. First, through the end of June, the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies has declined in line with the expectations we have shared since the first quarter. COVID therapy distribution contributes roughly $0.25 to our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance and the benefit from that exclusivity is not expected to repeat in fiscal 2022. Second, we will have higher interest expense in fiscal 2022 driven by the debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Third, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect our weighted average shares to be almost 211 million shares due primarily to the fully planned impact of the 2 million shares of our stock delivered to Walgreen at the close of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our share count will continue to tick higher in 2022 due to normal employee stock comp-related solution and the fact that we have committed to prioritize paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years and lose shareholder purchases. 
Moving past these modeling reminders. The strength of AmerisourceBergen is undeniable and is exemplified by our continued exceptional results quarter after quarter. This is the sixth quarter since the pandemic began and our results demonstrate the resilience and strength of our company. 
I am thoroughly impressed by the execution and performance across our businesses that has positioned us for continued success our pharmaceutical-centric foundation, market-leading talent and competitive positioning enabled us to capitalize on market trends and continue to deliver strong results. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks this morning, I would like to touch on our ESG and diversity and inclusion numbers. AmerisourceBergen remains focused on creating long-term financial value, and we continue to work diligently to build our corporate stewardship initiatives to ensure the work we are doing benefits all stakeholders. We are focused on continuing to build robust talent development programs so that all our team members feel they have opportunities to grow and learn. 
In our communities, we're supporting nonprofit partners through our foundation to expand access to quality health care, promote health equity and provide resources to ensure prescription drug safety. 
In addition, we aim to be environmental stewards in the communities where we live and work through initiatives like our commitment to using sustainable packaging to reduce the use of single-use plastics and working closely with our partners to optimize deliveries to minimize our greenhouse gas commission footprint. We look forward to providing further updates on our ESG progress as we continue to find ways to make a positive impact on the people, planet and communities where we live and work. 
As we focus in on the end of our fiscal year with strong momentum and continued outperformance across our business, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the important accomplishments we have already had this year. 
First, our teams continue to execute and leverage our capabilities to create differentiated value for our stakeholders. Second, our future growth has been further solidified by our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. Third, our purpose-driven culture continues to empower our team members that think, plan and act decisively to do it is right for our people, partners and communities. And finally, we continue our long-term commitment to strategically invest in our businesses and talent to ensure that AmerisourceBergen will continue to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
As we look to the future, I'm proud of the resilient foundation we have built while we facilitate pharmaceutical innovation and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

Generic inflation is trending relatively in line with our expectations and overall generic deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. But I think the key point I'd like to make in answering the question that you asked is that looking at our business model, our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing that it once was in the past. And several years ago, leadership of the company recognized the need to have more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals and that rebalancing ensures that AmerisourceBergen received fair compensation for the value we provide across brands, generics and specialty especially as the market continues to shift to include more specialty. And so our alignment with strategic key enter customers and our leadership in specialty continue to serve as positive differentiators for our positioning and results. And just like you were saying and asking in your question, it's really kind of evidenced in this quarter's results as we talked about in our prepared remarks this quarter, adjusted operating income was up 24% year-over-year. But we really, in particular, look at pharmaceutical distribution, pharmaceutical distribution operating income was up of 13% year-over-year, and we increased our guidance for the full year for Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income from high single digits to low double digits. And this is just one of the many drivers that enabled us to have the increase in EPS guidance of $0.20 to $0.25."

And so we think it's a combination of pent-up demand and return to normal. And with regard to the alliance question that you asked. Alliance had a strong start out of the gate when we initially announced the completion of the acquisition. In early June, we updated our EPS guidance to include $0.45 to $0.50 contribution from the business during the last 4 months of our fiscal year. And we now expect that Alliance will contribute approximately $0.50 in those 4 months of fiscal 2021."

It's in an important therapeutic area, which is diabetes. And of course, interchangeability will be more important for us when there's more than 1 product, but it's a positive development. And we are invested on take note of the FDA's flexibility and willingness to consider interchangeability. We think that it bodes well for the efficacy and the role that biosimilars were playing pharmaceuticals in the future. So again, that Part D biosimilars are our sweet spots. Thanks."

We cannot underscore enough what a fabulous job they're doing. The environment for them is really challenging. If you think about the global context that they operate in and all the different pandemic restrictions. And a lot of the business that we do there is based on international trade, which is not as easy to obtain as a [indiscernible]. So we recently visited with the team and that there was -- we had a short visit to the U.K. and the restrictions were lifted. It was wonderful to not only meet the Alliance team but also to see our World Courier leadership team and really give them a pat on the back because they have done a fabulous job growing the business and meeting the needs of their global clients throughout this very difficult period, and in many cases, shifting the business model to at home. 
We've owned the business for 8, 9 years now. And I have to tell you that this is a wonderful part of AB that keeps on growing and keep on buying new ways to maximize their expertise in clinical trial logistics and help the global pharma partners the innovation needs. 
And the last thing I'll say is it's a wonderful opportunity to share knowledge between Alliance Healthcare and World Courier. So we're very positive on that business."

If you look at our corporate team is focused in Weybridge and in the U.K., and that is the headquarters, the U.K. is also the headquarters for World Courier. But if you look at how AmerisourceBergen is positioning ourselves with Alliance, we have a good mixture of developed European markets and higher-growth emerging markets. It's a very important priority for us to develop the services and innovative lines in those markets. Our World Courier has a small expertise and a small presence in almost all the markets that their Alliance is already in. But we set up a lot of our commercialization businesses to help smaller companies launch products globally. And I sincerely feel this acquisition is going to give us opportunity to really have the presence, have the boots on the ground, the local market knowledge to look at both the innovative side, the distribution side and the commercialization side to benefit the patients we serve and the manufacturers that 1 global partners with the expertise of AmerisourceBergen."

Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claim",2005,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before we discuss our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. state attorneys generals and political subdivisions in participating states. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to address the normalcy of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to close with stakeholders concerning these complex matters.
AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and, alongside partners, combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve. 
Turning now to our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. AmerisourceBergen delivered yet another quarter of exceptional results driven by a high level of execution, purpose-minded team members and continued focus on delivering differentiated value. As we announced earlier this morning, we had revenues of over $53 billion representing growth of 18% from the same period last year, and we grew our adjusted EPS by 17% year-over-year. These results reflect continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses as we capitalize on our differentiated pharmaceutical-centric value proposition and as our team successfully executes on our key strategic initiatives. This strength and execution continue to create value for our shareholders. And today, we are again raising our fiscal 2021 full year guidance, which Jim will discuss later in greater detail. 
I will focus my remarks today on the key strategic pillars that are driving our strong performance, as well as how, with the addition of Alliance Healthcare, AmerisourceBergen continues to be well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders. AmerisourceBergen remains next-minded, and we are focused on continuing to enhance our ability to provide global healthcare solutions as we support pharmaceutical innovation and access, both in the United States and internationally. 
In the United States, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business continues to benefit from our industry-leading customer relationships, our leadership in specialty distribution and commercialization services and strong end market trends, including an earlier than expected return to pre-COVID prescription utilization trends in the June quarter. Our leading customer base includes our Good Neighbor Pharmacy and Elevate Provider Network members. They are proving daily that community pharmacies are at the forefront of providing quality and equitable care and maintaining deep levels of trust with their patients and communities. 
In fact, for the fifth year in a row, Good Neighbor Pharmacy was ranked highest amongst brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by J.D. Power. This is the tenth time we have received that honor in the past 12 years, and it is a testament to community awareness of the value of the quality care and experience patients receive at GNP member pharmacies. We held our annual Thoughtspot Conference last week, and I was touched and inspired by the stories that our members shared through the entrepreneurship, expertise and deep community roots, community pharmacies prove that they do more than just [ draw ] prescriptions. They are critical promoters of health equity across the U.S., often driving above and beyond to provide holistic care and health education at the local level, particularly in under-resourced communities. 
Since beginning of the pandemic, community pharmacies have stepped up fearlessly to meet the unprecedented challenges of a global health crisis and show the world why community pharmacies are integral to our communities. 
The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer. Another relevant example is on the animal side. The growth in pet ownership has increased demand for our veterinarian customers as pets are a cherished part of the family and the care a veterinarian provides is valued. This positive trend over the last year has long-term benefits for our business as MWI is well positioned with key anchor customers and services. 
On the human health side, access to local trusted expertise care remains vital, particularly for those dealing with complex health challenges that bring them into the care of specialty physician providers. 
As I've said from the onset of the pandemic, we are conscious of the negative impact that restricted measures have on patients when they have less access to screenings and tests that help doctors identify serious health issues. This has particularly impacted patients who are used to a doctor or health care facility. But now our customers have begun to see a normalization in new patient trends. And as a result, patients are more effectively being diagnosed and gaining access to treatment. This is a clear positive for patient care. 
As the leading provider of specialty distribution and commercialization services, we will continue to play our role in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access as patients visit volumes continues to normalize. Our specialty physician services business had strong performance this quarter and continues to differentiate AmerisourceBergen with leading value-added services, such as those through our physician GPOs. Additionally, bio centers continue to be a positive for our customers, our business and the healthcare system overall as they provide room for new innovative products to come to market. 
The innovations in CAR T and cell and gene therapies and the potential applications of the new mRNA technology offers the medical community new potential tools in the treatment of serious diseases that previously alluded truly effective care. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support all these innovations through our specialty distribution and manufacturer services offerings. Our unique ability to provide value-added expertise in conjunction with innovative solutions and quality service enhance our partnerships and grow our business. 
With strong partnerships, relationships and a leading portfolio of solutions to support a wide pipeline of practices and products, AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities provided by global pharmaceutical innovation as we drive growth in our business and help our partners tackle some of the most critical challenges based in healthcare. 
We have a strong foundation in place across our businesses. And in June, we took another significant step forward by closing the Alliance Healthcare transaction and welcoming their talented team to the AmerisourceBergen family. The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare is the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions and is a critical component to our future success. 
Alliance Healthcare is a strong and diversified pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services company with leading market positions across an attractive portfolio of both established European markets and high-growth emerging markets. 
In addition to their traditional wholesale business, Alliance Healthcare operates a range of leading higher-margin innovation businesses serving both upstream partners and downstream customers. The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare extends our distribution reach built by our market-leading services capabilities and expands on our key differentiators. 
Specifically, AmerisourceBergen's leading portfolio of key anchor customers now includes a long-term relationship with Boots in the U.K. and a network of independent pharmacies across Europe through the Alphega pharmacy network. Since the completion of the transaction, we have gotten the chance to know about the business and the people and Alliance Healthcare better, and we remain very positive about the opportunity that this landmark achievement provides AmerisourceBergen as we are positioned for a differentiated global growth platform. This includes our dedication to further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships to lead with market leaders in every segment and to supporting patient access wherever a prescription is needed. 
Second, AmerisourceBergen's leadership in specialty is further enhanced with key commercialization services in new markets. By leveraging the expertise and capabilities of our World Courier business, along with Alliance's Alloga and Alcura, we elevate our ability to be a differentiated solution provider for global manufacturers as they develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals around the world. This is complementary to the solutions that we provide at World Courier, which continues to play a key role of providing global specialty logistics through growth traditional commercial offerings and direct-to-patient clinical trial capabilities. We remain dedicated to expanding on our leadership in specialty and to enhancing our capabilities to support global pharmaceutical innovation. 
Third, AmerisourceBergen focuses on delivering best-in-class services and efficiency, and this transaction enhances our ability to develop innovation solutions that are fundamental to our success operationally and commercially. Our innovative mindset means that we embrace the advanced technologies, data and analytics, and now we can further support positive outcomes through our expanded global platform. 
This fiscal quarter, we were selected as the industry leader award winner at the 2021 SAP Innovation Awards for our work in developing SAP Advanced Track and Trace for Pharmaceuticals. This technology tracks millions of daily shipments at the batch level and further strengthens the pharmaceutical supply chain in the U.S. 
The value of a resilient and sustainable global pharmaceutical supply chain is vital and the ability to support pharmaceutical innovation to a global footprint with broad leadership and local expertise provide differentiated value for our partners. AmerisourceBergen stakeholders recognize the value we create, the importance of our purpose and the critical nature of the service and the infrastructure that we provide. 
Fourth, AmerisourceBergen continues to build upon our history of corporate stewardship, which focuses on advancing our people and culture, protecting the company's financial health and ensuring the long-term sustainable value creation. 
With Alliance Healthcare, we are now an even more global [indiscernible] company, and we are committed more than ever to advancing the value of our talent and culture. Over the past year, we have invested in enhancing our talent and diversity and inclusion strategies to enable more growth opportunities within our increasingly inclusive workplace. We recently launched our executive leadership initiative to accelerate the advancement and ongoing success of high potential black, Hispanic and Latinx team members at the mid and senior levels, addressing the most pronounced leadership and representation gaps identified over the last several months, following best-in-class research-based approaches. 
In the future, we plan to provide dedicated development opportunities for high-potential employees of additional underrepresented groups. Investing in our leadership development and talent and culture is important to our long-term sustainable growth, which is supported by diverse and inclusive teams. This focus is important to ensuring we capture the value of our collective differences and reflect our social commitment as we continue to strategically focus on delivering on all elements of ESG. Our ESG strategy is foundational to AmerisourceBergen, our leadership, our Board and our people. Recently, AmerisourceBergen joined the Science-based Targets initiative as we continue to line our business with best practice organizations around the world. At the local level, we continue to be deeply committed to our communities. 
This past year, we launched myCommunityImpact, Matching Gifts and Dollars for Doers Program, and we recently made it available to all global employees. Our philanthropic efforts have been recognized by DiversityInc, ranking us 8th in their annual 50 [ list ] in philanthropy rankings. 
As I closed my prepared remarks today, I remain truly inspired by the commitment and performance of our team members who are now numbering 41,000. With their unwavering passion and support, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to capitalize on our global footprint to provide leading pharmaceutical distribution services and to leverage our expertise as an innovative commercialization services provider internationally. 
We remain confident in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, our capabilities as partner of choice with market-leading manufacturer services and our role in continuing the acceleration of pharmaceutical innovation. 
By providing differentiated value to our stakeholders, focusing on our customers, expanding on our leadership in specialty and executing, innovating and supporting pharmaceutical innovation globally, we are well positioned to create long-term stakeholder value as we remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. 
Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our results and updated financial guidance. Jim?"

Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our third quarter results, I want to comment on the Pharmaceutical Distribution industry's continued progress towards reaching a negotiated resolution to substantially address the nationwide opioid litigation. The proposed settlement agreement represents an important step towards achieving a broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and aligns with the legal accrual the company recorded in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. 
AmerisourceBergen appreciates the enormity of the opioid epidemic, and this broad industry resolution is an important step towards delivering a meaningful relief to communities across the United States. 
Turning now to our business. AmerisourceBergen remains focused on our differentiated and innovative value proposition to deliver long-term growth and value creation to our stakeholders. Powered by our purpose-driven team members, we will continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy on an enhanced global platform to serve both upstream partners and downstream customers. 
As we recently completed the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare in the quarter, I would like to welcome the Alliance Healthcare team to AmerisourceBergen. Having joined AmerisourceBergen myself through an acquisition and experience several acquisitions during my tenure, I have seen firsthand a thoughtful and strategic approach AmerisourceBergen takes to successfully integrate acquired companies. We enjoy working with our incredibly talented new team members and learning more not only about their businesses, but also about how much we culturally have in common. 
As we have said since announcing the acquisition, Alliance Healthcare is a strong and efficient business, and we look forward to working together to continue to provide innovative solutions to our customers and stakeholders. 
My remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. 
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.16, an increase of 17%, which was driven by the continued strong performance across AmerisourceBergen's businesses and also benefited from the 1-month contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our consolidated revenue was $53.4 billion, up 18%, driven by revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare and our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health businesses. 
Consolidated gross profit increased 32% to $1.6 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. In the quarter, gross profit margin increased 33 basis points from the prior year quarter to 3.05%. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which has a higher gross profit margin and increase in sales of specialty products in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses. 
Regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses were $996 million, up 38% year-over-year due to the addition of the Alliance Healthcare business and also includes the internal investments we are making across our business with a focus on continuing to offer innovative services and solutions to our partners. These investments are important as they ensure we continue to create differentiated value and support our long-term growth. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $631 million, up 24% compared to the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment-level performance. Operating income margin grew 6 basis points to 1.18% as a result of the contribution from the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth in higher-margin businesses. 
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter. The net interest expense was $51 million, up 36% due to debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our effective income tax rate was 21%, up from 18.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which benefited from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count was 208.9 million shares, a 1.6% increase due to the dilution related to employee stock comp and the weighted average saving impact of the June issuance of 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as a part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. 
Turning now to adjusted free cash flow and cash. Our adjusted free cash flow was strong in our fiscal third quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow number to $1.2 billion, while our cash balance was $2.6 billion. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $49.3 billion, up 13% for the quarter driven by increased sales of specialty products and solid performance broadly across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses. 
Across our distribution businesses, we are seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends as there have been more normalized physician interaction patterns leading to new patient starts. 
Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment's operating income increased about 13% to $484 million. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit in the quarter from our leadership in specialty, where there has been a notable return to pre-COVID strength and continued positive biosimilar trends. 
I will now turn to Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. Alliance Healthcare is in our results for the month of June and had strong performance out of the gate. 
In the quarter, Other segment's revenue was $4.1 billion, up 128%, driven by the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and growth across the remaining operating segments. Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health revenue was up 22%. 
Other segment's operating income was $147 million, up 77% primarily due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and strong performance at both MWI and World Courier. Excluding the impact of Alliance Healthcare, Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health operating income was up 21%, reflecting the solid fundamentals of the businesses. 
World Courier has continued its exceptional performance, providing high-[indiscernible] specialty logistics around the globe. Despite challenges in global logistics due to limited international cargo space, the team has delivered industry-leading solutions and expertise to support our customers and partners. Looking ahead, the business is highly complementary to Alliance Healthcare's Alloga and Alcura businesses, and we are excited to offer an integrated suite of solutions on our enhanced global platform to serve our manufacturer customers. 
Turning now to MWI. The pandemic has truly encouraged all of us to focus on the health and wellbeing of our communities and families. And this includes our animal companions. Over 12 million families in the U.S. have gained pets since the pandemic began, and since pet owners view their pets as family members, the focus on health and wellbeing is a positive market trend for our MWI companion business. 
In the production animal market, our investments in technology solutions and the unique offering of value-added services position the business to support long-term global demand for protein. MWI's strong execution and customer relationships have allowed the business to remain a best-in-class provider that is well positioned to capture these positive market trends. 
That concludes our segment-level discussion, and I will now turn to our 2021 guidance. Following the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition back in June, we updated our 2021 guidance for revenue, adjusted diluted EPS and weighted average shares to reflect the expected contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the weighted average share count impacted the 2 million shares of stock that we delivered to Walgreens. 
Given the continued strong performance of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, we are again raising our EPS guidance from a range of $8.90 to $9.10, up to a range of $9.15 to $9.30, reflecting growth of 16% to 18% from the previous fiscal year. We are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021, including a meaningful increase to our expectations for consolidated and segment adjusted operating income. 
First, I'll begin with operating expenses. Operating expenses are now expected to be approximately $3.9 billion due to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. 
As a reminder, when you consider your models, Alliance Healthcare has higher margins for gross profit, operating expenses and operating income as evidenced by the update to our fiscal 2021 guidance for consolidated operating expenses to reflect the 4 months of Alliance Healthcare. 
Next, turning to operating income. We now expect operating income to be approximately $2.6 billion. This is a result of raising our Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income guidance to the low double-digit growth range given the strong trends we have continued to see in our business, including specialty, which was further bolstered by patient referral activity this quarter. 
This rate also reflects our expectation for operating income in Other of approximately $610 million to $620 million. Excluding the contribution from Alliance Healthcare, operating income growth for Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group is expected to be in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2021, driven by the strong performance of the World Courier and MWI. 
Finally, turning to free cash flow, we have raised our free cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.7 billion, up from approximately $1.5 billion. As it pertains to fiscal 2022, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of our current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process. 
That being said, we want to remind you 3 important items from fiscal 2021 as you consider your models. First, through the end of June, the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies has declined in line with the expectations we have shared since the first quarter. COVID therapy distribution contributes roughly $0.25 to our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS guidance, and the benefit from that exclusivity is not expected to repeat in fiscal 2022. 
Second, we will have higher interest expense in fiscal 2022 driven by the debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. 
Third, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect our weighted average shares to be almost 211 million shares due primarily to the fully planned impact of the 2 million shares of our stock delivered to Walgreens at the close of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. Our share count will continue to tick higher in 2022 due to normal employee stock comp-related solution and the fact that we have committed to prioritize paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years and [ lower ] shareholder purchases. 
Moving past these modeling reminders. The strength of AmerisourceBergen is undeniable and is exemplified by our continued exceptional results quarter-after-quarter. This is the sixth quarter since the pandemic began and our results demonstrate the resilience and strength of our company. 
I am thoroughly impressed by the execution and performance across our businesses that has positioned us for continued success. Our pharmaceutical-centric foundation, market-leading talent and competitive positioning enable us to capitalize on market trends and continue to deliver strong results. 
Before I conclude my prepared remarks this morning, I would like to touch on our ESG and diversity and inclusion numbers. AmerisourceBergen remains focused on creating long-term financial value, and we continue to work diligently to build our corporate stewardship initiatives to ensure the work we are doing benefits all stakeholders. We are focused on continuing to build robust talent development programs so that all our team members feel they have opportunities to grow and learn. 
In our communities, we're supporting nonprofit partners through our foundation to expand access to quality healthcare, promote health equity and provide resources to ensure prescription drug safety. 
In addition, we aim to be environmental stewards in the communities where we live and work through initiatives like our commitment to using sustainable packaging to reduce the use of single-use plastics and working closely with our partners to optimize delivery routes to minimize our greenhouse gas emission footprint. We look forward to providing further updates on our ESG progress as we continue to find ways to make a positive impact on the people, planet and communities where we live and work. 
As we focus in on the end of our fiscal year with strong momentum and continued outperformance across our business, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the important accomplishments we have already had this year. 
First, our teams continue to execute and leverage our capabilities to create differentiated value for our stakeholders. Second, our future growth has been further solidified by our acquisition of Alliance Healthcare. Third, our purpose-driven culture continues to empower our team members that think, plan and act decisively to do what is right for our people, partners and communities. And finally, we continue our long-term commitment to strategically invest in our businesses and talent to ensure that AmerisourceBergen will continue to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
As we look to the future, I'm proud of the resilient foundation we have built while we facilitate pharmaceutical innovation and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

Generic deflation is trending relatively in line with our expectations and overall generic deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. But I think the key point I'd like to make in answering the question that you asked is that looking at our business model, our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing that it once was in the past. And several years ago, leadership of the company recognized the need to have more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals and that rebalancing ensures that AmerisourceBergen receives fair compensation for the value we provide across brands, generics and specialty especially, as the market continues to shift to include more specialty. And so our alignment with strategic key anchor customers and our leadership in specialty continue to serve as positive differentiators for our positioning in results. 
And just like you were saying and asking in your question, it's really kind of evidenced in this quarter's results as we talked about in our prepared remarks this quarter, adjusted operating income was up 24% year-over-year. But we really, in particular, look at Pharmaceutical Distribution. Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income was up 13% year-over-year, and we increased our guidance for the full year for Pharmaceutical Distribution operating income from high single digits to low double digits. And this is just one of the many drivers that enabled us to have the increase in EPS guidance of $0.20 to $0.25."

And so as we said in our remarks, we're seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends. We're seeing patients are returning to physicians' offices, which is resulting in patient referrals to specialists and new patient starts. When we look at year-over-year retail Rx trends, we see that the year-over-year growth rates are higher in our third quarter compared to the year-over-year growth rates in the first half. And so we think it's a combination of pent-up demand and return to normal. 
And with regard to the Alliance question that you asked. Alliance had a strong start out of the gate when we initially announced the completion of the acquisition. In early June, we updated our EPS guidance to include $0.45 to $0.50 contribution from the business during the last 4 months of our fiscal year. And we now expect that Alliance will contribute approximately $0.50 in those 4 months of fiscal 2021."

So my first question is, with all this kind of like now in place in the increased visibility, one, how should we think about sort of steady-state EBIT or EPS growth beyond the 2022 headwinds and tailwinds? 
And then my second question that relates to that long-term outlook. We just recently saw a biosimilar approval with an interchangeable status. I think that's something that we've been waiting for, the industry have been waiting for a very long time. So how do you see this as kind of like long-term implication of this approval?

We're continuing to see really good performance there and also in community and specialty pharmacy, World Courier and WI. 
Some of the things that have benefited us and will continue to benefit us are our industry-leading customers. It's really a differentiator for AmerisourceBergen, and it's really across most of our businesses that we have these industry-leading customers that help with our long-term growth. It's the leadership in specialty that is really benefiting us, has been benefiting us and will continue to benefit us as we look at market trends, the biosimilar trends, the improvement in utilization, but really just kind of a strong end market trend, whether it be in oncology, biosimilars, companion animals. So those are the sorts of things which will really continue to benefit us over the longer term, Ricky."

It's a clear opportunity for us. Part B is the most impactful for us, especially in oncology with now 40% share for Avastin and Herceptin among other key products. What's interesting, of course, in oncology is the well-developed portfolio, services we have through our ION GPO and the strong access we have to community oncology practices and leaders. Also biosimilars, we pointed out, is a positive driver for our services businesses including Lash and Xcenda, where we focus on patient access, home economics and [ hearing ] solutions. 
Biosimilars are also becoming more positive in the health systems area. So I just noted and talked about the first interchangeable product. That isn't a Part B product. It's in an important therapeutic area, which is diabetes. And of course, interchangeability will be more important for us when there's more than 1 product, but it's a positive development. And we are impressed on, take note, of the FDA's flexibility and willingness to consider interchangeability. We think that it bodes well for the efficacy and the role that biosimilars will play in pharmaceuticals in the future. So again, that Part B biosimilars are our sweet spots. Thanks."

And we're seeing good performance at both AmerisourceBergen and Alliance, but most of that increase is due to AmerisourceBergen because if you look at Alliance during the 4 months, we have nice contribution of free cash flow but that's really largely offset by deal fees and expenses that to a large extent offset the Alliance free cash flow during the 4 months. And so most of that increase is attributable to AmerisourceBergen. 
And as we look at Alliance long term on the free cash flow front, the statement that we made at the closing of the deal is that we expect our combined free cash flow to be 1.25x what it would have been stand-alone for AmerisourceBergen.

Today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that AmerisourceBergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021, and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022. 
Before I begin, I want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. data [indiscernible] generals and political scout divisions in participating space. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to address the normality of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. If the industry's proposition agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment at this time. We pay our [indiscernible] supply chain seriously and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and long-time partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve. 
In fiscal 2021, AmerisourceBergen advanced its role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access. as we look at our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures by supporting our partners, customers and our own team members through challenging times. As the pandemic persists, the importance of our purpose in an evolving environment and an efficient global pharmaceutical supply chain is being felt by all our stackholders. We are proud to be able to offer our expertise, capabilities and infrastructure as part of the solution on facilitating the national distribution of COVID-19 therapies, to supporting the distribution of more than 75 million bank fees, to patients in over 30 countries through our expanded global footprint.

Our continuous investments and ongoing focus on being a strategic partner for our customers have deepened our relationships with all our stack holders during this time of increased focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain, enhancing our position as a provider of key solutions for our customers, both big and small. 
We also leverage our core capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and health care providers locally. In the U.S., we are a key partner for our community pharmacies, [indiscernible] and physician practices. In community pharmacy, we are particularly proud to support our good neighbor pharmacy members trusted role through our innovative tools and programs that are now independent pharmacists to optimize their operations and spend the most possible time serving their patients and communities. In July, for the fifth year in a row and for the tenth year of the past 12 years, Good Neighbor Pharmacy network was ranked highest amongst bricks and mortar change of store pharmacies by JD Colin. Our Animal Health business, we support veterinarian practices in similar ways to help them manage their practices as they continue to experience increased demand for its services due to growth in pet ownership. The cherry's role of families and increased importance based on ensuring health and well-being of all family members. We also continue to differentiate ourselves as the leader in specialty distribution and commercialization services. This fiscal year, we launched a variety of new services and solutions, bolting upon our historic investments to further drive our leadership in specialty with our customers and artists. 
For example, through our ION and other value-added solutions, we form new partnerships that offer industry-leading technologies to specialty physician services customer practices, enabling them to be even more efficient on enhancing their ability to improve the patient experience and ultimately, outcomes. We are also pleased to continue to support the growing adoption of biosimilar products in physician offices and community hospitals and health systems, facilitating patient access to important treatment choices to improve their health and well being. Internationally, we remain a leading provider of global pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated solutions in key markets across the globe.

Through our market-leading manufacturer solutions, including our global specialty logistics and commercialization offerings, we're also facilitating direct to patient clinical trials and helping manufacturers around the world navigate ever-increasing complexities of global logistics. Furthermore, we are leveraging our now expanded portfolio of international relationships, partnerships and solutions to facilitate patient access to the rapidly evolving landscape of new pharmaceutical technologies. As we continue to differentiate our business, we remain focused on being strategic partners with our customers as we help them achieve operational efficiencies and support growth in their businesses with innovative solutions. 
In fiscal 2021, we completed a significant investments by bringing the specialty distribution business onto the SAP platform, which will help improve efficiency, increase flexibility and support continuity. As a global health care company, we understand and appreciate the importance of ensuring our businesses have the technology mainly to support their operations and enhance their capabilities. Importantly, an increasingly critical part of our global role and responsibility is being strong corporate [indiscernible], that is ensuring our financial health, investing in our people culture and ensuring long-term and sustainable value creation. In terms of our financial health, we continue to take a thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment that focuses on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings, and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to remaining agencies. Notably, our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our health care capabilities, including the acquisition of [ Orion Healthcare ], which we completed in June. Since then, our culturally aligned teams have worked diligently to integrate our teams and businesses, conducting deep dive into strategically optimizing our operational and business development synergies to exploring ways to enhance the value we rate for our progress. 
As we are seeing through financial results and expectations, our new team members are talented, and I thank the combined AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare teams for the ongoing support of our integration efforts. Our financial strength also enables us to continue to invest in our people and culture. At AmerisourceBergen, we know our team members are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to inspiring them to achieve their fullest potential.

This year, we purged our diversity equity ingredient efforts with the rollout of new employee resource groups and new diverse candidate slate and objectives. To further align our people strategy with our business strategy, we also introduced a new leadership competency model that will be embedded through all of our [ 11 ] programs. 
Based on the collective feedback from team members across AmerisourceBergen, the new model focuses on developing the initial competencies aligned in 4 key business and cultural holes, [indiscernible] equity inclusion, collaboration, innovation and execution excellence and purpose. As a foundation for how we will recruit, engage and develop our people, this new model and the principles behind them will enable us to create value now and for the long term.

Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and to discuss fiscal '22 guidance. Jim?"

For AmerisourceBergen fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Amerisource Bergen merger completed, both the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the extension of the Walgreens contract through 2029 and our teams delivered another year of strong performance, driven by our continued execution and strategic division. Our pharmaceutical-centric business, robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services position us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale. 
Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 3 main areas this morning: first, I will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then we will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022, and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance. 
Beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million, up approximately 20%, reflecting growth in pharmaceutical distribution and other. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior year quarter. Consolidated gross profit was $2 billion, up 51%, driven by increases in gross profit in both Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which benefited from the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. This quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior year quarter as we had a full quarter of Alliance Healthcare and our consolidated results. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of Alliance Healthcare as well as investments in our talent and initiatives to support the company's current and future growth. This quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Also as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison of operating expenses. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses. 
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to Alliance Healthcare. Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income from the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares, a 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance accumulated shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. This completes the review of our consolidated results. 
Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses and overall positive prescription utilization trends. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. Operating income margin expanded by 2 basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. AmerisourceBergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. I will now turn to other, which includes Alliance Healthcare, MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. In the quarter, other revenue was $7.7 billion, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare as well as growth in the global commercialization services and Animal Health businesses. Other operating income was $223 million, up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. 
That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2021 results. Our consolidated revenue was $214 million, up 13%, driven by growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which includes 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. Consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the 4-month contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year, driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business and the important work our team has done to support the COVID therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. From a segment perspective, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. In fiscal 2021, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, both in the physician space and health systems. We saw a significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solution set was leveraged by manufacturers to meet their complex logistics for the distribution of COVID-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. 
Additionally, we continue to have strong performance in Specialty Division Services this fiscal year as the health care system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment. This supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes, resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. In Other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. Other meaningfully benefited from the 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare results, while World Courier and MWI also delivered strong results. As global logistics continue to be challenged by the pandemic, World Courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature-sensitive and other high-priority shipments. World Courier's direct to patient in one clinical trials continue to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. MWI continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet health and the production animal market and reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which has benefited from discrete tax items. Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% and $9.26, primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and outperformance in specialty and the 4-month contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in September, a benefit that will reverse in the December quarter due to the higher supplier payables. There was also better-than-expected cash flow at Alliance Healthcare. If you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow as the year would have been roughly $1.7 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. 
That completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results. I will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. Following the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation of how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. Following this review, which concluded in October, we will begin reporting our results in 2 new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, U.S. Health Care Solutions and International Health Care Solutions. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, excluding [indiscernible] distribution plus the following businesses, which had previously been reported in other. MWI Animal Health, Extenda, Lash Group and ICS 3PL. The International Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our non-U.S.-based Pharmaceutical Distribution and services solutions, including Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, AMR and pro forma distribution and pro forma specialty. As a reminder, we consolidate Propharma's results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly traded entity. Pro Forma Specialty was previously reported and other. This morning, we are also filing a Form 8-K with segmented financials for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. Our new reporting segments like AmerisourceBergen are built on the foundation of leading in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets. 
Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue to be approximately [ $207 million to $212 million ], representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. In International Healthcare Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. Moving on to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid- to high teens percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. The only business that was included in Pharmaceutical Distribution services that is not going into U.S. Health Care Solutions is Pro Forma Distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for Pharmaceutical Distribution services in fiscal 2021 and roughly 1% of segment operating income. 
As a reminder, as I said back in February and again in August, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies. We did have higher-than-expected COVID therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of August with a subsequent substantial decline in September. The final EPS benefit from COVID therapy sales for full year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. If you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on even lower October trends, the contribution from COVID therapy sales would be $0.03, which means the first quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. While this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in U.S. Health Care Solutions. We expect International Healthcare Solutions have operating income between $685 million and $715 million. Alliance Healthcare represents a little over 2/3 of operating income in the segment with World Courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. As you think about your first quarter models, we expect about 25% of the International segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. 
As you look at fiscal 2022 for the International segment, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, we have degreed to sell Pro Pharma Specialty as we focus on our core operating assets. The transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. Successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our International Healthcare Solutions segment's operating income. Second, in fiscal 2022, we will have a step up in expenses at Alliance Healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to IT modernization. As Steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity, and this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align Alliance Healthcare's business technology, operability and infrastructure with AmerisourceBergen. Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect Alliance to be high teens accretive to our standalone adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2022. Since closing the transaction, our teams have engaged both in person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. Most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare -- focused on Alliance Healthcare's manufacturer services businesses. I continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team at Alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions. 
Moving on to interest expense, tax rate and share count. We expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022, based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. Without the tax rate benefit from Alliance Healthcare's operations, our range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. Finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full year impact of the 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and normal dilution on stock compensation expense. As a reminder, as part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 million in total debt over the next 2 years in share repurchases. We currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount toward the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%. 
Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business order by Alliance Healthcare's IT infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of Alliance Healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. In closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for AmerisourceBergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities while the pandemic precipitate. I am proud of our 42,000 team members who worked tirelessly to support our customers, partners and patients and drove our strong financial results. Given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, I'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value. As we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities supported by our dedicated team members. AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, built on a foundation of leadership in Pharmaceutical Distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value for our manufacturer partners and health care provider customers.

And then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends? So for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? What's your expectation around cough, cold, flu, acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the office -- the physician office again, et cetera. If you can just help us to better understand that, that would be great."

I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solution",443,"Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue growth of 2% to 5% and adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 6%. And it's based on continued strong performance really across the business where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position. Now with regard to your question on COVID therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year '21 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial COVID therapy. The benefit we got from COVID therapies in fiscal year '21, as I said in my prepared remarks, was $0.30. 
And kind of let me give you some of the breakdown there. During the first quarter, it was $0.14. Second quarter was $0.07. Third quarter was $0.03 and fourth quarter was $0.06. So I'm sure that will help you in your modeling. And as we're looking at fiscal year '22, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 to be $0.03. So we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in U.S. Health Care Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, but we -- of course, as I said, expect 3% to 6% operating income growth for the full year, which includes, of course, Q1. Now you asked about other COVID therapies. And of course, it's early, but we may very well get some benefit from other COVID therapies. And that's exactly why we have -- one of the reasons why we have a range, and we have a $0.30 range in our EPS between $10.50 and $10.80. We don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. 
Now you also asked about utilization friends, which is a great question. And we are seeing strong utilization trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. And prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. And we did see -- have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year '22 across our businesses and customers. 
And I see that Steve would like to just add a couple of things on the overall business."

Whereas, the consulting business has been a lower growth business. And so I think that gives you a little bit of additional color there.

The 2 new segments will show that on a historical basis for fiscal year '21, and how they look in the fiscal year '21.

So we see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been officially created on products like that. On specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. I think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change to ASP, a tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs. And the wholesalers are very resilient, and we also do believe that [indiscernible] understand the health care. Pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of health care.

Today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that AmerisourceBergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021, and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022.
Before I begin, I want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. State Attorney Generals and political scout divisions in participating states. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to addressing the enormity of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. 
If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and alongside partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.  
In fiscal 2021, AmerisourceBergen advanced its role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access, as we look at our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures by supporting our partners, customers and our own team members through challenging times. As the pandemic persists, the importance of our purpose in an evolving environment and an efficient global pharmaceutical supply chain is being felt by all our stakeholders. We are proud to be able to offer our expertise, capabilities and infrastructure as part of the solution on facilitating the national distribution of COVID-19 therapies, to supporting the distribution of more than 75 million vaccines to patients in over 30 countries through our expanded global footprint. 
Our business has leveraged its position of market strength to become an increasingly vital partner of choice through differentiated solutions for our upstream and downstream customers. Our continuous investments and ongoing focus on being a strategic partner for our customers have deepened our relationships with all our stakeholders during this time of increased focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain, enhancing our position as a provider of key solutions for our customers, both big and small. We also leverage our core capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and health care providers locally. 
In the U.S., we are a key partner for our community pharmacies, veterinarians and physician practices. In community pharmacy, we are particularly proud to support our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members trusted role through our innovative tools and programs that allow independent pharmacists to optimize their operations and spend the most possible time serving their patients and communities. 
In July, for the fifth year in a row and for the tenth year of the past 12 years, Good Neighbor Pharmacy network was ranked highest amongst brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by JD Colin. 
In our Animal Health business, we support veterinarian practices in similar ways to help them manage their practices as they continue to experience increased demand for its services due to growth in pet ownership. The cherished role of pets within families and increased importance based on ensuring health and well-being of all family members. We also continue to differentiate ourselves as the leader in specialty distribution and commercialization services. This fiscal year, we launched a variety of new services and solutions, bolting upon our historic investments to further drive our leadership in specialty with our customers and orders. 
For example, through our ION and other value-added solutions, we form new partnerships that offer industry-leading technologies to specialty physician services customer practices, enabling them to be even more efficient on enhancing their ability to improve the patient experience and ultimately, outcomes.
We are also pleased to continue to support the growing adoption of biosimilar products in physician offices and community hospitals and health systems, facilitating patient access to important treatment choices, to improve their health and well-being. Internationally, we remain a leading provider of global pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated solutions in key markets across the globe. 
Earlier, I mentioned the distribution of tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines to patients in more than 30 countries. Through our market-leading manufacturer solutions, including our global specialty logistics and commercialization offerings, we're also facilitating direct-to-patient clinical trials and helping manufacturers around the world navigate the ever-increasing complexities of global logistics. 
Furthermore, we are leveraging our now expanded portfolio of international relationships, partnerships and solutions to facilitate patient access to the rapidly evolving landscape of new pharmaceutical technologies. As we continue to differentiate our business, we remain focused on being strategic partners with our customers as we help them achieve operational efficiencies and support growth in their businesses with innovative solutions.
In fiscal 2021, we completed a significant technology investment by bringing the specialty distribution business onto the SAP platform, which will help improve efficiency, increase flexibility and support continuity. As a global health care company, we understand and appreciate the importance of ensuring our businesses have the technology they need to support their operations and enhance their capabilities. Importantly, an increasingly critical part of our global role and responsibility is being strong corporate stewards, that is ensuring our financial health, investing in our people culture and ensuring long-term and sustainable value creation. 
In terms of our financial health, we continue to take a thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment that focuses on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings, and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to the rating agencies. 
Notably, our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our health care capabilities, including the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which we completed in June. Since then, our culturally-aligned teams have worked diligently to integrate our teams and businesses, conducting deep dive into strategically optimizing our operational and business development synergies to exploring ways to enhance the value we grade to our partners. As we are seeing through financial results and expectations, our new team members are talented, and I thank the combined AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare teams for the ongoing support of our integration efforts. 
Our financial strength also enables us to continue to invest in our people and culture. At AmerisourceBergen, we know our team members are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to inspiring them to achieve their fullest potential. Our efforts go well beyond the table space of offering market align pay, and we understand the long-term advantage of being a fair and equitable employer, who offers competitive wages at all levels. We have surveyed our team members to find out what's most valuable to them and have invested in attractive benefit programs, such as increased paid parental leave, child and dependent care, and enhanced mental health and wellness programs. 
Our team members also value a culture of flexibility, and we responded with a thoughtfully designed, new way of working that provides options for flexibility while balancing the need for in-person connection and innovation. On ensuring the safety of themselves and their loved ones during the pandemic to investing in world-class learning technology and models, we understand that it is absolutely critical that our talent is cultivated and empowered to help drive our long-term growth. Our efforts have been recognized, and we have once again been certified as a great place to work company and named a best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. Meaningful value can also be unlocked when individuals are empowered to bring their whole selves to work, and we embrace our collective differences. 
This year, we furthered our diversity, equity inclusion efforts with the rollout of new employee resource groups and new diverse candidate slate objectives. To further align our people strategy with our business strategy, we also introduced a new leadership competency model that will be embedded throughout all of our talent programs. 
Based on the collective feedback from team members across AmerisourceBergen, the new model focuses on developing the initial competencies aligned to 4 key business and cultural poles, diversity, equity and inclusion, collaboration, innovation and executional excellence and purpose. As a foundation for how we will recruit, engage and develop our people, this new model and the principles behind them will enable us to create value now and for the long term. 
Another aspect of our culture, one which helps ensure sustainable value creation, is our dedication to operating in a sustainable and responsible manner and to supporting healthy and resilient communities, where we live and work. During the quarter, we are proud to have become a participant of the UN Global Compact, the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. We also held our third annual AmerisourceBergen Foundation Conference, which helps Foundation grantees connect and learn from each other and the Foundation team to help them become even more effective in their work to positively impact local communities around the world. Our continued progress in areas like ESG, diversity, equity inclusion and strategic planning are made possible by the expert oversight and guidance to our board as well as the ability of our management team to drive execution and operational excellence.
Looking ahead, our key growth pillars enable us to maintain our leading market position and to solidify our differentiated value proposition in fiscal '22 and beyond. First, we are focused on our customers. Through our unique partnership model, we formed long-term lasting relationships and integrate us operationally and enable us to provide value-added solutions that help further strengthen our ability to lead with market leaders. 
Second, we are focused on expanding on our leadership in specialty by leveraging our global reach, market-leading capabilities and ability to support rapidly accelerating and global pharmaceutical innovation, we strengthened our capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers. 
Third, we are focused on execution excellence. This includes continuously investing in our business, which increases our flexibility, expands our suite of capabilities and enhances our customer experience. 
Fourth, we are focused on supporting pharmaceutical innovation around the world. With a global manufacturer services platform, we aim to be the strategic partner of choice to global manufacturers as we help them innovate, solve the complex challenges of global logistics and market access, and capture the opportunities of rapidly accelerating pharmaceutical innovation. 
Downstream, we provide data-driven insights, efficiency solutions and our unmatched scale to help optimize customer operations and support access for patients in the -- on the smallest to largest populations across all sites of care and across all classes of trade. 
And finally, our growth is supported by investments in our people, culture and all dimensions at ESG. By investing in our people and culture, we advance our most important resource. By committing to ESG, we create healthier futures around the world and unlock the added value of being a responsible and impact for enterprise, which ultimately enables a strong and healthy financial position to achieve long-term sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
AmerisourceBergen has made exceptional progress on our strategic priorities, further enhancing our differentiated value proposition and driving consistent outperformance throughout the year as we continue to capitalize on our positive momentum into fiscal 2022. We remain driven by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Now powered by 42,000 team members globally, we remain confident in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated manufacturer solutions. 
Thank you to all our team members for their inspiring dedication this year, and we look forward to a great year ahead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and to discuss fiscal '22 guidance. Jim?"

For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Amerisource and Bergen Brunswick merger completed, both the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the extension of the Walgreens contract through 2029, and our teams delivered another year of strong performance, driven by our continued execution and strategic decisioning. Our pharmaceutical-centric business, robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services position us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale.
Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 3 main areas this morning: first, I will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then we will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022 and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance.  
Beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million, up approximately 20%, reflecting growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior year quarter. 
Consolidated gross profit was $2 billion, up 51%, driven by increases in gross profit in both Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which benefited from the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. This quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior year quarter as we had a full quarter of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of Alliance Healthcare as well as investments in our talent and initiatives to support the company's current and future growth. This quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Also as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison of operating expenses. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses.
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to Alliance Healthcare. Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income from the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares, a 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance accumulated shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. This completes the review of our consolidated results.  
Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses and overall positive prescription utilization trends. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. Operating income margin expanded by 2 basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. AmerisourceBergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. 
I will now turn to Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare, MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. In the quarter, Other revenue was $7.7 billion, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare as well as growth in the global commercialization services and Animal Health businesses. Other operating income was $223 million, up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. 
Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2021 results. Our consolidated revenue was $214 million, up 13%, driven by growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other, which includes 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. Consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the 4-month contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year, driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business and the important work our team has done to support the COVID therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. 
From a segment perspective, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. In fiscal 2021, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, both in the physician space and health systems. We saw a significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solution set was leveraged by manufacturers to meet their complex logistics for the distribution of COVID-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. 
Additionally, we continue to have strong performance in Specialty Division Services this fiscal year as the health care system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment. This supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes, resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. 
In Other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. Other meaningfully benefited from the 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare results, while World Courier and MWI also delivered strong results. As global logistics continue to be challenged by the pandemic, World Courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature-sensitive and other high-priority shipments. World Courier's direct-to-patient in home clinical trials continue to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. 
MWI continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet health and the production animal market, the reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand.
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which has benefited from discrete tax items. 
Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% and $9.26, primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and outperformance in specialty and the 4-month contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in September, a benefit that will reverse in the December quarter due to the higher supplier payables. There was also better-than-expected cash flow at Alliance Healthcare. If you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow for the year would have been roughly $1.7 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. That completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results.  
I will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. Following the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation of how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. Following this review, which concluded in October, we will begin reporting our results in 2 new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, U.S. Health Care Solutions and International Health Care Solutions. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, excluding Profarma Distribution plus the following businesses, which had previously been reported in Other, MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. 
The International Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our non-U.S.-based Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services solutions, including Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar and Profarma Distribution and Profarma Specialty. As a reminder, we consolidate Profarma's results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly-traded entity. Profarma Specialty was previously reported in Other.  
This morning, we are also filing a Form 8-K with 3 segmented financials for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. Our new reporting segments, like AmerisourceBergen, are built on the foundation of leading in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets.
Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. 
Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue to be approximately $207 billion to $212 billion, representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. In International Healthcare Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. 
Moving on to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid- to high teens percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. The only business that was included in Pharmaceutical Distribution services that is not going into U.S. Health Care Solutions is Profarma Distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for Pharmaceutical Distribution Services in fiscal 2021 and roughly 1% of segment operating income. 
As a reminder, as I said back in February and again in August, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies. We did have higher-than-expected COVID therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of August with a subsequent substantial decline in September. The final EPS benefit from COVID therapy sales for full year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. If you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on even lower October trends, the contribution from COVID therapy sales would be $0.03, which means the first quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. While this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in U.S. Health Care Solutions. 
We expect International Healthcare Solutions have operating income between $685 million and $715 million. Alliance Healthcare represents a little over 2/3 of operating income in the segment, with World Courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. As you think about your first quarter models, we expect about 25% of the International segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. 
As you look at fiscal 2022 for the International segments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, we have agreed to sell Profarma Specialty as we focus on our core operating assets. The transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. Successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our International Healthcare Solutions segment's operating income. 
Second, in fiscal 2022, we will have a step up in expenses at Alliance Healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to IT modernization. As Steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity, and this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align Alliance Healthcare's business technology, operability and infrastructure with AmerisourceBergen. 
Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect Alliance to be high teens accretive to our standalone adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2022. Since closing the transaction, our teams have engaged both in person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. Most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare, focused on Alliance Healthcare's manufacturer services businesses. I continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team at Alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions.
Moving on to interest expense, tax rate and share count. We expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022, based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. Without the tax rate benefit from Alliance Healthcare's operations, our range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. 
Finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full year impact of the 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and normal dilution from stock compensation expense. 
As a reminder, as part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years in lieu of share repurchases. We currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount toward the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%.  
Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business or to buy Alliance Healthcare's IT infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of Alliance Healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. 
In closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for AmerisourceBergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities while the pandemic persisted. I am proud of our 42,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to support our customers, partners and patients and drove our strong financial results. Given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, I'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value. 
As we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities supported by our dedicated team members. AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, built on a foundation of leadership in Pharmaceutical Distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value for our manufacturer partners and health care provider customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?"

I understand that there's a number of incremental businesses that are now within that segment, but you made a comment about COVID-19 therapies. So when we think about 2022, one, is there nothing built into your expectation around that? And two, just given the number of new therapies that are coming to market, for example, I think about the new Merck therapy that's just been announced, is it not reasonable to think that there's going to be some benefit as we go into 2022 for COVID therapies, would be my first question. And then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends? So for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? What's your expectation around cough, cold, flu, acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the office -- the physician office again, et cetera. If you can just help us to better understand that, that would be great."
24809,1684382959,2425258,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solution",443,"Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue growth of 2% to 5% and adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 6%. And it's based on continued strong performance really across the business, where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position. 
Now with regard to your question on COVID therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year '21 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial COVID therapy. The benefit we got from COVID therapies in fiscal year '21, as I said in my prepared remarks, was $0.30. 
And kind of let me give you some of the breakdown there. During the first quarter, it was $0.14, second quarter was $0.07, third quarter was $0.03 and fourth quarter was $0.06. So I'm sure that will help you in your modeling. And as we're looking at fiscal year '22, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 to be $0.03. So we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in U.S. Health Care Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, but we -- of course, as I said, expect 3% to 6% operating income growth for the full year, which includes, of course, Q1. 
Now you asked about other COVID therapies. And of course, it's early, but we may very well get some benefit from other COVID therapies. And that's exactly why we have -- one of the reasons why we have a range, and we have a $0.30 range in our EPS between $10.50 and $10.80. We don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. 
Now you also asked about utilization friends, which is a great question. And we are seeing strong utilization trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. And prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. And we did see -- have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year '22 across our businesses and customers.
And I see that Steve would like to just add a couple of things on the overall business."

And so that has been a higher growth business in fiscal year '21, whereas the consulting business has been a lower growth business. And so I think that gives you a little bit of additional color there. And then one thing that we are doing today is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are filing an 8-K where we'll show the segments. The 2 new segments will show that on a historical basis for fiscal year '21, and how they look in the fiscal year '21.

We've been very interested in benefit design, and we also prefer when the market creates their own solutions for problems, such as high copays for adherence products that are so detrimental to the system when a diabetic patient doesn't take the insulin. So we see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been officially created on products like that. 
On specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. I think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change to ASP, a tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs. And the wholesalers are very resilient, and we also do believe that [indiscernible] understand the health care, pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of health care. So there's nothing that tremendously concerns us as a business. Our concern is always with preserving innovation and making sure that our providers have a stable reimbursement environment that they can get, continue to run their businesses and take care of patients.

Today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that AmerisourceBergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021, and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022.
Before I begin, I want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of U.S. State Attorney Generals and political scout divisions in participating states. Throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to addressing the enormity of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. 
If the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the United States with substantial financial support. Clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. We take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. AmerisourceBergen will continue to work diligently and alongside partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve.  
In fiscal 2021, AmerisourceBergen advanced its role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access, as we look at our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures by supporting our partners, customers and our own team members through challenging times. As the pandemic persists, the importance of our purpose in an evolving environment and an efficient global pharmaceutical supply chain is being felt by all our stakeholders. We are proud to be able to offer our expertise, capabilities and infrastructure as part of the solution on facilitating the national distribution of COVID-19 therapies, to supporting the distribution of more than 75 million vaccines to patients in over 30 countries through our expanded global footprint. 
Our business has leveraged its position of market strength to become an increasingly vital partner of choice through differentiated solutions for our upstream and downstream customers. Our continuous investments and ongoing focus on being a strategic partner for our customers have deepened our relationships with all our stakeholders during this time of increased focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain, enhancing our position as a provider of key solutions for our customers, both big and small. We also leverage our core capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and health care providers locally. 
In the U.S., we are a key partner for our community pharmacies, veterinarians and physician practices. In community pharmacy, we are particularly proud to support our Good Neighbor Pharmacy members trusted role through our innovative tools and programs that allow independent pharmacists to optimize their operations and spend the most possible time serving their patients and communities. 
In July, for the fifth year in a row and for the tenth year of the past 12 years, Good Neighbor Pharmacy network was ranked highest amongst brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by J.D. Power. 
In our Animal Health business, we support veterinarian practices in similar ways to help them manage their practices as they continue to experience increased demand for its services due to growth in pet ownership. The cherished role of pets within families and increased importance based on ensuring health and well-being of all family members. We also continue to differentiate ourselves as the leader in specialty distribution and commercialization services. This fiscal year, we launched a variety of new services and solutions, bolting upon our historic investments to further drive our leadership in specialty with our customers and orders. 
For example, through our ION and other value-added solutions, we form new partnerships that offer industry-leading technologies to specialty physician services customer practices, enabling them to be even more efficient on enhancing their ability to improve the patient experience and ultimately, outcomes.
We are also pleased to continue to support the growing adoption of biosimilar products in physician offices and community hospitals and health systems, facilitating patient access to important treatment choices, to improve their health and well-being. Internationally, we remain a leading provider of global pharmaceutical distribution services and differentiated solutions in key markets across the globe. 
Earlier, I mentioned the distribution of tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines to patients in more than 30 countries. Through our market-leading manufacturer solutions, including our global specialty logistics and commercialization offerings, we're also facilitating direct-to-patient clinical trials and helping manufacturers around the world navigate the ever-increasing complexities of global logistics. 
Furthermore, we are leveraging our now expanded portfolio of international relationships, partnerships and solutions to facilitate patient access to the rapidly evolving landscape of new pharmaceutical technologies. As we continue to differentiate our business, we remain focused on being strategic partners with our customers as we help them achieve operational efficiencies and support growth in their businesses with innovative solutions.
In fiscal 2021, we completed a significant technology investment by bringing the specialty distribution business onto the SAP platform, which will help improve efficiency, increase flexibility and support continuity. As a global health care company, we understand and appreciate the importance of ensuring our businesses have the technology they need to support their operations and enhance their capabilities. Importantly, an increasingly critical part of our global role and responsibility is being strong corporate stewards, that is ensuring our financial health, investing in our people culture and ensuring long-term and sustainable value creation. 
In terms of our financial health, we continue to take a thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment that focuses on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings, and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to the rating agencies. 
Notably, our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our health care capabilities, including the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare, which we completed in June. Since then, our culturally-aligned teams have worked diligently to integrate our teams and businesses, conducting deep dive into strategically optimizing our operational and business development synergies to exploring ways to enhance the value we grade to our partners. As we are seeing through financial results and expectations, our new team members are talented, and I thank the combined AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare teams for the ongoing support of our integration efforts. 
Our financial strength also enables us to continue to invest in our people and culture. At AmerisourceBergen, we know our team members are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to inspiring them to achieve their fullest potential. Our efforts go well beyond the table space of offering market align pay, and we understand the long-term advantage of being a fair and equitable employer, who offers competitive wages at all levels. We have surveyed our team members to find out what's most valuable to them and have invested in attractive benefit programs, such as increased paid parental leave, child and dependent care, and enhanced mental health and wellness programs. 
Our team members also value a culture of flexibility, and we responded with a thoughtfully designed, new way of working that provides options for flexibility while balancing the need for in-person connection and innovation. On ensuring the safety of themselves and their loved ones during the pandemic to investing in world-class learning technology and models, we understand that it is absolutely critical that our talent is cultivated and empowered to help drive our long-term growth. Our efforts have been recognized, and we have once again been certified as a great place to work company and named a best place to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign. Meaningful value can also be unlocked when individuals are empowered to bring their whole selves to work, and we embrace our collective differences. 
This year, we furthered our diversity, equity inclusion efforts with the rollout of new employee resource groups and new diverse candidate slate objectives. To further align our people strategy with our business strategy, we also introduced a new leadership competency model that will be embedded throughout all of our talent programs. 
Based on the collective feedback from team members across AmerisourceBergen, the new model focuses on developing the initial competencies aligned to 4 key business and cultural poles, diversity, equity and inclusion, collaboration, innovation and executional excellence and purpose. As a foundation for how we will recruit, engage and develop our people, this new model and the principles behind them will enable us to create value now and for the long term. 
Another aspect of our culture, one which helps ensure sustainable value creation, is our dedication to operating in a sustainable and responsible manner and to supporting healthy and resilient communities, where we live and work. During the quarter, we are proud to have become a participant of the UN Global Compact, the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. We also held our third annual AmerisourceBergen Foundation Conference, which helps Foundation grantees connect and learn from each other and the Foundation team to help them become even more effective in their work to positively impact local communities around the world. Our continued progress in areas like ESG, diversity, equity inclusion and strategic planning are made possible by the expert oversight and guidance to our board as well as the ability of our management team to drive execution and operational excellence.
Looking ahead, our key growth pillars enable us to maintain our leading market position and to solidify our differentiated value proposition in fiscal '22 and beyond. First, we are focused on our customers. Through our unique partnership model, we formed long-term lasting relationships and integrate us operationally and enable us to provide value-added solutions that help further strengthen our ability to lead with market leaders. 
Second, we are focused on expanding on our leadership in specialty by leveraging our global reach, market-leading capabilities and ability to support rapidly accelerating and global pharmaceutical innovation, we strengthened our capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers. 
Third, we are focused on execution excellence. This includes continuously investing in our business, which increases our flexibility, expands our suite of capabilities and enhances our customer experience. 
Fourth, we are focused on supporting pharmaceutical innovation around the world. With a global manufacturer services platform, we aim to be the strategic partner of choice to global manufacturers as we help them innovate, solve the complex challenges of global logistics and market access, and capture the opportunities of rapidly accelerating pharmaceutical innovation. 
Downstream, we provide data-driven insights, efficiency solutions and our unmatched scale to help optimize customer operations and support access for patients in the -- on the smallest to largest populations across all sites of care and across all classes of trade. 
And finally, our growth is supported by investments in our people, culture and all dimensions at ESG. By investing in our people and culture, we advance our most important resource. By committing to ESG, we create healthier futures around the world and unlock the added value of being a responsible and impact for enterprise, which ultimately enables a strong and healthy financial position to achieve long-term sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders. 
AmerisourceBergen has made exceptional progress on our strategic priorities, further enhancing our differentiated value proposition and driving consistent outperformance throughout the year as we continue to capitalize on our positive momentum into fiscal 2022.

For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Amerisource and Bergen Brunswick merger completed, both the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the extension of the Walgreens contract through 2029, and our teams delivered another year of strong performance, driven by our continued execution and strategic decisioning. Our pharmaceutical-centric business, robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services position us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale.
Before I turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. I will provide commentary in 3 main areas this morning: first, I will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then we will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022 and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance.  
Beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the strong performance in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment. Our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million, up approximately 20%, reflecting growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior year quarter. 
Consolidated gross profit was $2 billion, up 51%, driven by increases in gross profit in both Pharmaceutical Distribution and other, which benefited from the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. This quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior year quarter as we had a full quarter of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of Alliance Healthcare as well as investments in our talent and initiatives to support the company's current and future growth. This quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of Alliance Healthcare in our consolidated results. Also as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison of operating expenses. 
Turning now to consolidated operating income. Our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by increases in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, which I will discuss in more detail when I review segment level performance. Operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from Alliance Healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses.
Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to Alliance Healthcare. Our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. The lower effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income from the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares, a 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance accumulated shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. This completes the review of our consolidated results.  
Now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses and overall positive prescription utilization trends. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. Operating income margin expanded by 2 basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. AmerisourceBergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. 
I will now turn to Other, which includes Alliance Healthcare, MWI, World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting. In the quarter, Other revenue was $7.7 billion, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from Alliance Healthcare as well as growth in the global commercialization services and Animal Health businesses. Other operating income was $223 million, up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of Alliance Healthcare. That concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. 
Now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2021 results. Our consolidated revenue was $214 million, up 13%, driven by growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other, which includes 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. Consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the 4-month contribution of Alliance Healthcare. Excluding Alliance Healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year, driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business and the important work our team has done to support the COVID therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. 
From a segment perspective, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. In fiscal 2021, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, both in the physician space and health systems. We saw a significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solution set was leveraged by manufacturers to meet their complex logistics for the distribution of COVID-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. 
Additionally, we continue to have strong performance in Specialty Division Services this fiscal year as the health care system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment. This supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes, resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. 
In Other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. Other meaningfully benefited from the 4 months of contribution from Alliance Healthcare results, while World Courier and MWI also delivered strong results. As global logistics continue to be challenged by the pandemic, World Courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature-sensitive and other high-priority shipments. World Courier's direct-to-patient in home clinical trials continue to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. 
MWI continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet health and the production animal market, the reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand.
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which has benefited from discrete tax items. 
Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% and $9.26, primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and outperformance in specialty and the 4-month contribution from Alliance Healthcare. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in September, a benefit that will reverse in the December quarter due to the higher supplier payables. There was also better-than-expected cash flow at Alliance Healthcare. If you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow for the year would have been roughly $1.7 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. That completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results.  
I will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. Following the acquisition of Alliance Healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation of how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. Following this review, which concluded in October, we will begin reporting our results in 2 new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, U.S. Health Care Solutions and International Health Care Solutions. The U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment, excluding Profarma Distribution plus the following businesses, which had previously been reported in Other, MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group, and ICS 3PL. 
The International Healthcare Solutions segment will consist of our non-U.S.-based Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services solutions, including Alliance Healthcare, World Courier, Innomar and Profarma Distribution and Profarma Specialty. As a reminder, we consolidate Profarma's results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly-traded entity. Profarma Specialty was previously reported in Other.  
This morning, we are also filing a Form 8-K with 3 segmented financials for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. Our new reporting segments, like AmerisourceBergen, are built on the foundation of leading in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets.
Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis. So all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. 
Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue to be approximately $207 billion to $212 billion, representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. In International Healthcare Solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. 
Moving on to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid- to high teens percent range. On a segment level, we expect U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. The only business that was included in Pharmaceutical Distribution services that is not going into U.S. Health Care Solutions is Profarma Distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for Pharmaceutical Distribution Services in fiscal 2021 and roughly 1% of segment operating income. 
As a reminder, as I said back in February and again in August, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of COVID-19 therapies. We did have higher-than-expected COVID therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of August with a subsequent substantial decline in September. The final EPS benefit from COVID therapy sales for full year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. If you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on even lower October trends, the contribution from COVID therapy sales would be $0.03, which means the first quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. While this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in U.S. Health Care Solutions. 
We expect International Healthcare Solutions have operating income between $685 million and $715 million. Alliance Healthcare represents a little over 2/3 of operating income in the segment, with World Courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. As you think about your first quarter models, we expect about 25% of the International segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. 
As you look at fiscal 2022 for the International segments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, we have agreed to sell Profarma Specialty as we focus on our core operating assets. The transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. Successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our International Healthcare Solutions segment's operating income. 
Second, in fiscal 2022, we will have a step up in expenses at Alliance Healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to IT modernization. As Steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity, and this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align Alliance Healthcare's business technology, operability and infrastructure with AmerisourceBergen. 
Alliance Healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect Alliance to be high teens accretive to our standalone adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal 2022. Since closing the transaction, our teams have engaged both in person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. Most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare, focused on Alliance Healthcare's manufacturer services businesses. I continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team at Alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions.
Moving on to interest expense, tax rate and share count. We expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the Alliance Healthcare acquisition. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022, based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. Without the tax rate benefit from Alliance Healthcare's operations, our range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. 
Finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full year impact of the 2 million shares delivered to Walgreens as part of the closing of the Alliance Healthcare acquisition and normal dilution from stock compensation expense. 
As a reminder, as part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next 2 years in lieu of share repurchases. We currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount toward the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%.  
Turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business or to buy Alliance Healthcare's IT infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. For adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of Alliance Healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. 
In closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for AmerisourceBergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities while the pandemic persisted. I am proud of our 42,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to support our customers, partners and patients and drove our strong financial results. Given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, I'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value. 
As we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities supported by our dedicated team members. AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, built on a foundation of leadership in Pharmaceutical Distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value for our manufacturer partners and health care provider customers.
With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?"

I understand that there's a number of incremental businesses that are now within that segment, but you made a comment about COVID-19 therapies. So when we think about 2022, one, is there nothing built into your expectation around that? And two, just given the number of new therapies that are coming to market, for example, I think about the new Merck therapy that's just been announced, is it not reasonable to think that there's going to be some benefit as we go into 2022 for COVID therapies, would be my first question. And then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends? So for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? What's your expectation around cough, cold, flu, acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the office -- the physician office again, et cetera. If you can just help us to better understand that, that would be great."
24809,1684382959,2476028,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solution",443,"Lisa, thank you. Great question. I'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then I think Steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. But as you know, our guidance for this year for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue growth of 2% to 5% and adjusted operating income growth of 3% to 6%. And it's based on continued strong performance really across the business, where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position. 
Now with regard to your question on COVID therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year '21 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial COVID therapy. The benefit we got from COVID therapies in fiscal year '21, as I said in my prepared remarks, was $0.30. 
And kind of let me give you some of the breakdown there. During the first quarter, it was $0.14, second quarter was $0.07, third quarter was $0.03 and fourth quarter was $0.06. So I'm sure that will help you in your modeling. And as we're looking at fiscal year '22, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 to be $0.03. So we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. And so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in U.S. Health Care Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, but we -- of course, as I said, expect 3% to 6% operating income growth for the full year, which includes, of course, Q1. 
Now you asked about other COVID therapies. And of course, it's early, but we may very well get some benefit from other COVID therapies. And that's exactly why we have -- one of the reasons why we have a range, and we have a $0.30 range in our EPS between $10.50 and $10.80. We don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. 
Now you also asked about utilization friends, which is a great question. And we are seeing strong utilization trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. And prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. And we did see -- have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year '22 across our businesses and customers.
And I see that Steve would like to just add a couple of things on the overall business."

So we're happy and very -- if I look back on '21, I think of it is a year that the last deal got done and the year that we responded so well to assisting with the need for corresponding to the COVID pandemic and including keeping our people safe. So that's what I think would be the highlights. But Jim, I think you gave an exhaustive answer. So we'll probably move on to the next question, please."

And so that has been a higher growth business in fiscal year '21, whereas the consulting business has been a lower growth business.

So U.S. is -- I think somewhat over fixated on the cost of medications relative to overall health care spending. We've been very interested in benefit design, and we also prefer when the market creates their own solutions for problems, such as high copays for adherence products that are so detrimental to the system when a diabetic patient doesn't take the insulin. So we see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been officially created on products like that. 
On specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. I think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change to ASP, a tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs. And the wholesalers are very resilient, and we also do believe that [indiscernible] understand the health care, pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of health care. So there's nothing that tremendously concerns us as a business. Our concern is always with preserving innovation and making sure that our providers have a stable reimbursement environment that they can get, continue to run their businesses and take care of patients. But definitely, I think we spend a lot of time, and I'm not very interested in. Thanks for the question."

Thank you. We're tremendously proud of the benefits we're getting from the recently announced Alliance transaction, including that we have a contract with Boots, who's become a very significant customer with -- of our Alliance division through 2031. And most importantly, we extended our Walgreens contract in the U.S. through 2029. And this is such a fundamental customer for us that helps us establish such a strong base of scale and efficiency. 
And I think the teams are at a very good state where we're looking to how can we help with one and other priorities. We have these discussions with all our large customers and the need for the very large customers like Walgreens are very different than say, the independent veterinarians, the community pharmacists. But yes, for example, we're supporting WBA with their central fill initiatives, and we're looking to understand better how we can help with their strategies on the institutional side. So I just would say that the relationship is in a good place, and we still go back to that 2013 agreement as being very fundamental to the success of AmerisourceBergen over the last decade."

As you think about the moving pieces -- and I appreciate the color, Jim, you gave so far relative to the market improvement, but in terms of the upside, downside of the range, what are the macro factors have to look like to get to those numbers? And I'm more just curious because on an all-in basis, you have obviously been tracking higher than that and outpacing the rest of the market. And so whether -- antivirals are one component, but what else are the moving pieces that you think about in terms of what encapsulates the range on the U.S. segment?"

And that's the impact that COVID therapies could have. So that really impacts the range. And again, it was a $0.30 of benefit in fiscal year '21 and $0.14 of that came in the first quarter of fiscal year '21, and we're expecting that the benefit will be significantly less in fiscal year '22. But Steve talked about some of the innovation that's occurring, it could be higher. And so that's something that certainly could impact the range, and that would be one of the larger things. 
And then, of course, there's always a number of moving pieces in our businesses. We have very strong performing businesses, but they're moving pieces within the businesses in terms of growth rates. And then there's sorts of things that I've also mentioned, like some higher labor and transportation costs and how those trend. And so those are some of the things that impact us within the range. But I do want to say that we have a lot of confidence in the business, and we are expecting continued strong performance across the business because of our differentiated physician and our strength, both within Pharmaceutical Distribution and Manufacturer solutions."
