Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results showed a strong momentum in our business. We delivered Q1 non-GAAP revenue of $626 million, representing revenue growth of 10%. We also delivered 7",246,"Thank you, Suzanne, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results showed a strong momentum in our business. We delivered Q1 non-GAAP revenue of $626 million, representing revenue growth of 10%. We also delivered 70% non-GAAP software revenue growth, systems growth of 5% and global services growth of 1%.
Several quarters into the pandemic, several things are becoming clearer from a macro perspective. First, the realities of the pandemic have accelerated our customers' digital transformation in both business and consumer dependency on applications.
At the same time, consumers' expectations about their application experience have increased significantly. As a result of higher volumes and higher consumer expectations, our customers are ramping their investments in their applications and the infrastructure needed to securely deliver them.
In addition, incumbency is a significant advantage for F5 in the current environment. Customers want a trusted and operationalized partner they know they can count on. These micro drivers play to our strength, including our strategy to invest over the last several years in pursuit of our adaptive applications vision.
Our continued investments in BIG-IP for multi-cloud deployments and the deliberate and early investments in both NGINX and Shape are enabling us to rapidly grow our application security and delivery footprint in modern application environments. I will speak more to our business growth drivers and momentum, including some customer highlights from the quarter. After Frank reviews our first quarter financial results and our outlook for Q2.

As we previewed in our preliminary results announcement and as François just highlighted, we delivered a very strong Q1. On a GAAP basis, Q1 revenue was $625 million. First quarter non-GAAP revenue of $",969,"Thank you, François, and good afternoon, everyone. As we previewed in our preliminary results announcement and as François just highlighted, we delivered a very strong Q1. On a GAAP basis, Q1 revenue was $625 million. First quarter non-GAAP revenue of $626 million was up 10% year-over-year and well above the high end of our initial $595 million to $615 million guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures. 
Also, this will be the last quarter we speak about non-GAAP revenue as we lap the acquisition of Shape. Going forward, the add-back of the shaped purchase accounting write-down is de minimis. Q1 product revenue of $289 million was up 23% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. This is the strongest product revenue growth we have delivered since Q2 of FY 2011, nearly a decade ago. 
As François noted, customers accelerating their digital transformation efforts drove growth in both our software and system sales. Software revenue was $111 million, growing 70% compared to the year ago period, which did not include contribution from Shape. Excluding Shape's contribution in Q1 of '21, software revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year. Our mix shift continued this quarter with software representing 38% of product revenue in Q1, up from 28% in the year ago quarter. Customers' preference for flexible subscription models continue to fuel our subscription revenue momentum. In Q1, we again drove record subscription volume with subscriptions representing 77% of software revenue in the quarter. 
Services revenue of $337 million grew 1% year-over-year and represented 54% of revenue. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions, as a service and utility based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 66% of revenue in the quarter. This is up from 63% in the year ago period. The improvement comes largely as a result of the strong subscription software momentum I mentioned previously. 
Systems revenue of $179 million was up 5% compared to last year. François will speak to the drivers of this strong performance in more detail. On a regional basis, in Q1, Americas delivered 14% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 55% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 4% growth, representing 26% of revenue, while APAC grew 7% and accounted for 19% of revenue. Looking at our bookings by vertical. Enterprise customers represented 67% of product bookings. Service providers accounted for 14% and government customers represented 18% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. federal. 
Let me now share our Q1 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses were $392 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $322 million. Our GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 18.9%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.7%. 
GAAP net income for the quarter was $88 million or $1.41 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $161 million or $2.59 per share. I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $137 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.5 billion at quarter end. We did not make any share repurchases in Q1. We remain committed to repurchasing $1 billion in shares over the next 2 years, including $500 million via an accelerated share repurchase program in fiscal year 2021. DSO was 50 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $5 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. 
We ended the quarter with approximately 6,160 employees, up approximately 50 from Q4. Now let me share our guidance for our fiscal second quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Also, with the Volterra deal recently closed, our Q2 outlook incorporates the addition of their financials to our guidance expectations. 
Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support application growth PAUSE and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on an investment in application security. With this in mind, we are targeting Q2 fiscal year 2021 revenue in the range of $625 million to $645 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 8.5% at the midpoint of our range. While we do not give quarterly guidance on product revenue mix, we do anticipate continued near-term strength in systems with Q2 growth likely similar to Q1. We would also remind you that our prior year Q2 software revenue growth was exceptionally strong at 96%. 
This difficult comparison is likely to be reflected in our Q2 21 software growth rate being below our horizon 2 target of 35% to 40%. This is consistent with our commentary about the potential for quarterly variability and software growth rates as we continue to scale our software business. We expect Q2 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5%, and we estimate operating expenses of $340 million to $352 million. 
As we discussed last quarter, we generally see a seasonal increase in operating expenses in Q2. We expect our Q2 operating margin to decline from Q1 and then to increase in the back half of the year to achieve our FY '21 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. I will remind you once more that our Q2 '21 outlook also incorporates the addition of Volterra into our operating model. We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q2 will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our Q2 earnings target is $2.32 to $2.44 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $62 million to $64 million. As for capital deployment, as I mentioned previously, we intend to repurchase 500 million shares via an accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2021. With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

Several quarters into the pandemic, it is growing clearer that COVID has accelerated digital transformation and both business and consumer dependency on applications. As a result, our customers are accelerating their digital transformation investments. Incumbency is also an advantage for us in the current environment. And together, these trends are enabling us to drive strong growth. 
Underneath these macro drivers and consistent with our discussion at our November analyst and investor meeting, there are 3 F5-specific growth drivers fueling our demand. One, ongoing software and subscription momentum; two, growing demand for application security; and three, resiliency in system space demand leading to moderating systems revenue declines. As we noted in November, these multiple growth drivers mean that we also have multiple paths to achieve our horizon 2 revenue growth targets. 
More specifically, we do not need everything to go exactly right to achieve our goals. In Q1, we had a lot go right and customer demand drove growth across all 3 of these drivers. I will speak to each in turn. First, we continue to see demand for software and subscription consumption across our application security and delivery solutions. I will focus first on our BIG-IP and NGINX solutions. Customers look to Big-IP to refresh core business applications for capacity additions and to simplify traditional application delivery in cloud environments. In one example, during Q1, a large financial institutions struggle for months to turn up a mission-critical application in a cloud environment. 
This was despite the best efforts of the cloud provider that we're working with. Frustrated, they turn to F5. In under one day, we help them get the app up and running in the cloud with multiple BIG-IP virtual editions. This use case highlights the customer benefits we have driven as a result of our investment to modernize BIG-IP, making it easier and more efficient to use in cloud environments. 
Let me turn to NGINX. At the time of the NGINX acquisition, we deliberately invested in new products, accelerating time to market. Specifically, we built a joint F5 NGINX controller and rapidly ported F5 security to the NGINX platform. This quarter, NGINX delivered its largest quarter ever with broad-based strength across geographies. This strength was driven in large part by robust NGINX control attraction as well as integrated F5 security through NGINX App PROTECT. During Q1, we also secured a win from BIG-IP, controller, NGINX Plus and NGINX PROTECT with a long time F5 federal government customer. 
While upgrading its current BIG-IP infrastructure, this customer also selected NGINX to help prepare for migrating network infrastructure from physical to virtual, while building out capabilities to support continualization. NGINX is leading the way in a number of modern application use cases, including cloud-native load balancing, scaling FPIs and delivering Kubernetes applications in production. 
As applications continue to get more distributed, we expect the investments we are making to deliver API gateway, API management and service mesh capabilities will drive additional NGINX momentum. It should come as no surprise that customer demand for application security is also growing. With the ongoing pandemics fueling ever-increasing consumer use of digital channels, the threat landscape is growing significantly. 
With application based attacks growing both in numbers and sophistication, customers are looking to a file for help. The combination of our organic investment and the addition of Shape has created an enhanced F5 application security portfolio. 
If you map our solution set against the top application security threats, it is clear that we are very well positioned to help our customers address the most frequent incidents and the most damaging breaches. We continue to see increased interest in adding F5's enterprise-grade web application firewall protection to modern applications. 
During Q1, a major car manufacturer selected NGINX with AppProtech when they needed a cloud independent, portable, scalable solution that included a container friendly web application firewall. We also are seeing growing traction for SSL orchestration. This end-creep equipped use case is a strategic differentiator for F5. And while it tends not to be a big revenue driver on its own, it is a strategic control point in enterprise customer security stack, which gives us the ability to pull in BIG-IP security and shape. 
Let me speak also to the traction we are seeing with Shape and in particular, our Shape silverline combination. Last quarter, we highlighted the benefit of making Shape's industry-leading anti-fraud solutions available to a much larger customer base, through our silverline managed services platform. silverline Shape defense delivers advanced bot protection to prevent large-scale fraud. Shape AI-fraud engine or safe, is a cloud fraud prevention service. As a combined solution, our silverline Shape defense and safe solutions enables sparsely resourced organizations to deploy true industry leading capabilities. 
Combining Shape's anti-Bot and anti-fraud capabilities with silverline in managed service also makes it easy to quickly deploy Shape's capabilities, which is especially useful when customers are in crisis. There are 2 interesting use cases that have emerged. First, Shape silverline defense is being used by several U.S. states to combat ramp and fraud related to unemployment benefits. 
The combination of sky-high demand and limited security of fraud capabilities created an ideal environment for fraud stores who are conducting sophisticated attacks against unemployment sites as well as other unprotected state domains. With a Shape silverline defense solution, we can go in and offer real data about what is happening, unveiling the true scale of the threat. Once enabled, Shape's sophisticated AI and machine learning capabilities identify and block the fraudsters. Credit unions also are emerging as an ideal use case for shaped silverline defense. With new web and mobile banking capabilities coming online and larger transfer limits being introduced, credit unions can present an easy target for sophisticated attackers. 
Pressure to provide the same services as big banks is exposing them and their lack of cybersecurity and fraud capabilities. Shape silverline defense provides an affordable turnkey, easy to deploy managed security and fraud solution as evidenced by the 5 credit union wins our sales teams delivered in Q1 2021. 
We are as excited as ever about the use cases Shape has opened for us. Going forward, we see additional potential to leverage Shape's analytics engine to build new analytics offerings that enable us to go beyond application security to drive revenue enhancements for customers. Finally, let us talk about systems and the drivers for the growth we saw in Q1. 
First, I will note that our systems business is also benefiting from the macro trends I mentioned previously, namely COVID-driving increased application use and accelerating investment in digital transformation. Q1 strength in systems was broad-based across geographies and industries. 
We identified 3 primary factors behind our strong systems performance. First, as we have discussed previously, we have seen growing demand for systems-based security use cases; second, over the last several years, customers have gained clarity on their cloud strategies and now expect to operate in a hybrid multi-cloud world for some time to come. As a result, they are more willing to purchase systems to support capacity needs driven by accelerating digital transformation. We believe both of these drivers are sustainable; third, Q1 also benefited from some COVID suppressed systems catch up. Customers who have put off systems purchases for several quarters simply can no longer defer growing capacity demands. 
For a very small subset of our customers that had not refreshed in a long time, a long-planned April end of software development milestone on one of our legacy systems contributed to their desire to act sooner rather than later. For clarity, I would note that end of software development is very different than end of support. 
In this case, the April milestone pertains to a net of software development date that has been well-publicized for years, providing customers a long planning runway. We estimate this catch-up demand drove approximately $10 million in system sales in Q1. We see this as a transient systems growth driver though we do expect it to carry over into Q2. 
Finally, while I did not call it out as a growth driver, our expanded reach and role has also expanded our strategic position with customers. This has enhanced our ability to connect with C-level personas and also means we are more often considered for opportunities that span our application security and delivery portfolio, bridging traditional and modern applications in both hardware and software form factors. As an example, in Q1, one of the United States' leading health care providers selected BIG-IP hardware, software, security and NGINX to keep the critical care applications running nonstop while beginning to migrate to next-generation apps for their care providers. This project we emerged as a priority for the customer after being deferred last February, so the customer can divert all necessary resources to fighting COVID. 
In closing, we are encouraged by our momentum and believe we are seeing clear signs that our organic investments and our value creation methodology for both NGINX and Shape are paying off for customers and investors alike. We were very pleased to announce that our acquisition of Volterra as yesterday, and the team has already begun the hard work of integration. Initial customer feedback about the combination of F5 and Volterra has been very positive. Customers are excited about the potential of F5's Edge 2.0 to eliminate the pain they field from today's closed edge platforms. 
Our edge 2.0 will be the first edge platform built for enterprises and service providers. It will be an OpenEdge platform that will allow every service to run on 80 server, virtual or otherwise, inclusive of public clouds. We are very excited to have the Volterra team as part of F5 and are looking forward to sharing our progress with you going forward. I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 G again as well as our customers and our partners. With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

So I think if you look at where we're at today Sami, there are 2 kind of macro things that are benefiting the company in general. Generally, there's more spending on applications infrastructure. And we have positioned ourselves to benefit from that. 
And I think that's a long term effect. There's also the effect of -- the company is strategically better positioned because of the combination of hardware and software and cloud solutions and security solutions that we have. And that allows us to have more strategic conversations with our customers and being seen as a future-proof partner for the strategic plans. And all of that benefits all of our business, including our systems business. If you look at the drivers specifically to our systems business, there are 2 drivers that I think are long-term and one that is more of a transient driver. 
So if you look specifically on the long term, we talked about at Analyst Day that our mix of security had grown, and that was helping our systems business. And this quarter, we saw again stronger growth in security than in the overall demand. The -- so that helps the systems business. The second factor in our systems business, is that generally, we have some customers who -- if you recall, we talked about that 2, 3 years ago, customers who basically have said they were either going all-in on the cloud or they were essentially pausing their -- the systems business to reconsider their architecture for public cloud deployments. 
And I think a lot of customers were seeing have kind of graduated from that and now have a clear strategy around the cloud. They have maturity around knowing that they're going to operate in hybrid-cloud environments for a long time to come. And they're very comfortable moving forward with hardware as part owns their long-term architecture. And so we're seeing some customers that have decided not to buy any more hardware at all that are coming back and now refreshing or adding capacity to their systems. 
And so I think those 2 aspects are longer term, Sami. There is one transient driver, which is a subset of our customers that really had to make a refresh because it is end of software development. We think that was about $10 million in the quarter. We think that kind of carries on in Q2 but that's a really short-term demand. So when you take all of that into account, I mean, we're not changing our horizon to guidance but yes, there is the possibility that our hardware business will do better in Horizon 2 than what we saw at   IM  . 
We certainly think that for FY '21, it's likely to do better than what we had in our overall Horizon 2 guidance."

Beacon is still early days. But certainly, with NGINX, there is a significant factor. And we're seeing it here is the halo effect of our participation in modern application. We are -- what's happening, Alex, is a lot of times, we think about traditional and modern applications in kind of separate silos. But the reality for large enterprises is they do a lot of application modernization. That is they will have a traditional application that is typically supported by BIG-IP. And as they modernize that application, they don't refactor it but they add modern components to that application. And these new modern component, typically microservices, NGINX is ideally suited to support these modern components. And so we're seeing that the combination of NGINX and BIG-IP gives a full solution set for these modernization, these modernization initiatives that customers have and it's pulling both NGINX and BIG-IP together. So there's definitely an effect of the portfolio and the synergies coming together and driving growth."

First, could you guys talk a little bit about the organic software revenue growth line, Frank, understanding the tough compare. But maybe just talk a little bit about how we should look at that line in the future? Are we going to see it being a little bit less lumpy, particularly as we've seen deferred revenue really, really grow pretty strongly. So is that something you expect to normalize around a higher number as we get through some of the tougher compares? 
And then second, I think at your Analyst Day or somewhere around there, you talked about $100 million cloud revenue number. Could you just give us a little color in the quarter, whether it's qualitative or quantitative around how the cloud specific software businesses did for F5?"

And as the business continues to scale and as we get more of it from recurring subscriptions, we do expect to have some more normalization in that and not necessarily see the same swings. But as we talked about from the beginning when we discussed software revenue, gosh, almost 3 years ago now, we said that it will be lumpy for this time as we continue to build up scale in the model. But overall, we are not changing at all our Horizon 2 outlook of a compounded annual growth rate of 35% to 40%. François, do you want to add anything on the cloud side?"

And just generally, Tim, to the demand of software, yes, we will see still some variability, but the overall demand drivers for software are very strong. And I'll point to a couple. We had a high -- all-time high a number of multiyear subscription agreements in the quarter. A lot of these subscription agreements include multiple software solutions from F5, including NGINX. NGINX had the best quarter ever, and we're really seeing as customers start to really deploy these modern applications, NGINX growing very fast. 
We also made some investments still, as you know, in NGINX, a year ago in the controller and app security, and we're seeing the effect of those in terms of growing the size of deals that we have. And the addressable deals that we can bring to the table. And so when you factor that cloud, the number of subscription agreements, NGINX and some new catalysts that haven't played out yet. We have some catalysts around the true forwards in our subscriptions, some new use cases for Shape that are coming. So we feel very good about our software for Horizon."

What we're seeing, Meta is our incumbency in a number of customers and the fact that we're operationalized, whether we're operationalizing hardware or in software is actually a significant advantage because we still see a lot of customers that continue to do incremental things, and we'll come back to bigger transformational projects later.

If you look at the recent trends, it's possible that we're going to see on our systems business, a better trend than what we anticipated in our Horizon 2 guidance. 
Now I will remind you that when we laid out our Horizon 2 guidance and the drivers of growth for F5, that are driving the 7% to 8% growth, there were 3 substantial drivers. The first one is continued momentum in software and software subscriptions, and we are continuing -- I mean, we posted 70% growth year-on-year this quarter. And we're going to continue to see very strong growth in software because the flywheel of subscriptions that we've put in motion now 2.5 years ago is really working well for us as a motion and for our customers. The second driver is demand for application security, and we're seeing that also being very strong, boosted by the addition of Shape and the use cases that I've talked about. 
And then the third driver was a moderation in our systems declines. And we had said at the time, it would moderate from double-digit to high to mid single-digit decline. Now we felt when we put the guidance together that not all 3 of these things have to go -- had to go perfectly for us to achieve the 7% to 8%. And so we have multiple paths of getting there. And right now, in this first quarter, essentially, there -- all 3 are pretty much going very well. So if that continues, I hope there's a possibility we do better than what we thought. And right now, specifically in hardware, the trends are pretty strong."

And in hardware, some of the drivers we're seeing that I've talked to are actually sustainable. There is a change there that we're seeing in how customers are approaching deployment of traditional applications in this hybrid-cloud environment. And the place that they're giving F5 in their go-forward plans and the strategic position we occupy now, I think that is sustainable. There are a couple of things that I think are transient that are not. And so how much of that will play out in terms of FY '22 and beyond, it's really too early to say that now."

Several quarters into the pandemic, several things are becoming clearer from a macro perspective. First, the realities of the pandemic have accelerated our customers' digital transformation in both business and consumer dependency on applications.
At the same time, consumers' expectations about their application experience have increased significantly. As a result of higher volumes and higher consumer expectations, our customers are ramping their investments in their applications and the infrastructure needed to securely deliver them.
In addition, incumbency is a significant advantage for F5 in the current environment. Customers want a trusted and operationalized partner they know they can count on. These micro drivers play to our strength, including our strategy to invest over the last several years in pursuit of our adaptive applications vision.
Our continued investments in BIG-IP for multi-cloud deployments and the deliberate and early investments in both NGINX and Shape are enabling us to rapidly grow our application security and delivery footprint in modern application environments.

As we previewed in our preliminary results announcement and as Francois just highlighted, we delivered a very strong Q1. On a GAAP basis, Q1 revenue was $625 million. First quarter non-GAAP revenue of $626 million was up 10% year-over-year and well above the high end of our initial $595 million to $615 million guidance range.
Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures. Also, this will be the last quarter we speak about non-GAAP revenue as we lap the acquisition of Shape. Going forward, the add-back of the Shape purchase accounting write-down is de minimis.
Q1 product revenue of $289 million was up 23% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 46% of total revenue. This is the strongest product revenue growth we have delivered since Q2 of FY 2011, nearly a decade ago.
As Francois noted, customers accelerating their digital transformation efforts drove growth in both our software and system sales. Software revenue was $111 million, growing 70% compared to the year ago period, which did not include contribution from Shape. Excluding Shape's contribution in Q1 of '21, software revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year.
Our mix shift continued this quarter with software representing 38% of product revenue in Q1, up from 28% in the year ago quarter. Customers' preference for flexible subscription models continue to fuel our subscription revenue momentum. In Q1, we again drove record subscription volume with subscriptions representing 77% of software revenue in the quarter.
Services revenue of $337 million grew 1% year-over-year and represented 54% of revenue. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 66% of revenue in the quarter. This is up from 63% in the year ago period. The improvement comes largely as a result of the strong subscription software momentum I mentioned previously.
Systems revenue of $179 million was up 5% compared to last year. Francois will speak to the drivers of this strong performance in more detail. On a regional basis, in Q1, Americas delivered 14% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 55% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 4% growth, representing 26% of revenue, while APAC grew 7% and accounted for 19% of revenue. Looking at our bookings by vertical, enterprise customers represented 67% of product bookings, service providers accounted for 14% and government customers represented 18% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. Federal.
Let me now share our Q1 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 81.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%. GAAP operating expenses were $392 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $322 million. Our GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 18.9%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.7%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $88 million or $1.41 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $161 million or $2.59 per share.
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $137 million in cash flow from operations in Q1. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.5 billion at quarter end. We did not make any share repurchases in Q1. We remain committed to repurchasing $1 billion in shares over the next 2 years, including $500 million via an accelerated share repurchase program in fiscal year 2021.
DSO was 50 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $5 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 6,160 employees, up approximately 50 from Q4.
Now let me share our guidance for our fiscal second quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Also, with the Volterra deal recently closed, our Q2 outlook incorporates the addition of their financials to our guidance expectations.
Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support application growth and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on and investment in application security.
With this in mind, we are targeting Q2 fiscal year 2021 revenue in the range of $625 million to $645 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 8.5% at the midpoint of our range. While we do not give quarterly guidance on product revenue mix, we do anticipate continued near-term strength in systems with Q2 growth likely similar to Q1.
We would also remind you that our prior year Q2 software revenue growth was exceptionally strong at 96%. This difficult comparison is likely to be reflected in our Q2 21 software growth rate being below our Horizon 2 target of 35% to 40%. This is consistent with our commentary about the potential for quarterly variability and software growth rates as we continue to scale our software business. We expect Q2 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5%, and we estimate operating expenses of $340 million to $352 million.
As we discussed last quarter, we generally see a seasonal increase in operating expenses in Q2. We expect our Q2 operating margin to decline from Q1 and then to increase in the back half of the year to achieve our FY '21 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. I will remind you once more that our Q2 '21 outlook also incorporates the addition of Volterra into our operating model.
We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q2 will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our Q2 earnings target is $2.32 to $2.44 per share. We expect Q2 share-based compensation expense of approximately $62 million to $64 million. As for capital deployment, as I mentioned previously, we intend to repurchase 500 million shares via an accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2021.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?"

Several quarters into the pandemic, it is growing clearer that COVID has accelerated digital transformation in both business and consumer dependency on applications. As a result, our customers are accelerating their digital transformation investments. Incumbency is also an advantage for us in the current environment. And together, these trends are enabling us to drive strong growth.
Underneath these macro drivers and consistent with our discussion at our November analyst and investor meeting, there are 3 F5-specific growth drivers fueling our demand: one, ongoing software and subscription momentum; two, growing demand for application security; and three, resiliency in system space demand leading to moderating systems revenue declines.
As we noted in November, these multiple growth drivers mean that we also have multiple paths to achieve our Horizon 2 revenue growth targets. More specifically, we do not need everything to go exactly right to achieve our goals. In Q1, we had a lot go right, and customer demand drove growth across all 3 of these drivers. I will speak to each in turn.
First, we continue to see demand for software and subscription consumption across our application security and delivery solutions. I will focus first on our BIG-IP and NGINX solutions. Customers look to BIG-IP to refresh core business applications for capacity additions and to simplify traditional application delivery in cloud environments.
In one example, during Q1, large financial institutions struggled for months to turn up a mission-critical application in a cloud environment. This was despite the best efforts of the cloud provider that we're working with. Frustrated, they turn to F5. In under one day, we help them get the app up and running in the cloud with multiple BIG-IP virtual editions. This use case highlights the customer benefits we have driven as a result of our investment to modernize BIG-IP, making it easier and more efficient to use in cloud environments.
Let me turn to NGINX. At the time of the NGINX acquisition, we deliberately invested in new products, accelerating time to market. Specifically, we built a joint F5 NGINX controller and rapidly ported F5 security to the NGINX platform.
This quarter, NGINX delivered its largest quarter ever with broad-based strength across geographies. This strength was driven in large part by robust NGINX control attraction as well as integrated F5 security through NGINX App Protect.
During Q1, we also secured a win from BIG-IP, controller, NGINX Plus and NGINX App Protect with a long time F5 federal government customer. While upgrading its current BIG-IP infrastructure, this customer also selected NGINX to help prepare for migrating network infrastructure from physical to virtual, while building out capabilities to support continualization. NGINX is leading the way in a number of modern application use cases, including cloud-native load balancing, scaling APIs and delivering Kubernetes applications in production.
As applications continue to get more distributed, we expect the investments we are making to deliver API gateway, API management and service mesh capabilities will drive additional NGINX momentum. It should come as no surprise that customer demand for application security is also growing. With the ongoing pandemics fueling ever-increasing consumer use of digital channels, the threat landscape is growing significantly. With application-based attacks growing both in numbers and sophistication, customers are looking to F5 for help.
The combination of our organic investment and the addition of Shape has created an enhanced F5 application security portfolio. If you map our solution set against the top application security threats, it is clear that we are very well positioned to help our customers address the most frequent incidents and the most damaging breaches.
We continue to see increased interest in adding F5's enterprise-grade web application firewall protection to modern applications. During Q1, a major car manufacturer selected NGINX with App Protect when they needed a cloud-independent, portable, scalable solution that included a container friendly web application firewall.
We also are seeing growing traction for SSL orchestration. This encrypt/decrypt use case is a strategic differentiator for F5. And while it tends not to be a big revenue driver on its own, it is a strategic control point in enterprise customer's security stack, which gives us the ability to pull in BIG-IP security and Shape.
Let me speak also to the traction we are seeing with Shape and, in particular, our Shape Silverline combination. Last quarter, we highlighted the benefit of making Shape's industry-leading anti-fraud solutions available to a much larger customer base, through our Silverline-managed services platform.
Silverline Shape Defense delivers advanced BoT protection to prevent large-scale fraud. Shape AI Fraud Engine or SAFE is a cloud fraud-prevention service. As a combined solution, our Silverline Shape Defense and SAFE solutions enables sparsely resourced organizations to deploy true industry-leading capabilities. Combining Shape's anti-bot and anti-fraud capabilities with Silverline in managed service also makes it easy to quickly deploy Shape's capabilities, which is especially useful when customers are in crisis.
There are 2 interesting use cases that have emerged. First, Shape Silverline Defense is being used by several U.S. states to combat rampant fraud related to unemployment benefits.
The combination of sky-high demand and limited security of fraud capabilities created an ideal environment for fraudsters who are conducting sophisticated attacks against unemployment sites as well as other unprotected state domains. With a Shape Silverline Defense solution, we can go in and offer real data about what is happening, unveiling the true scale of the threat. Once enabled, Shape's sophisticated AI and machine learning capabilities identify and block the fraudsters.
Credit unions also are emerging as an ideal use case for Shape Silverline Defense. With new web and mobile banking capabilities coming online and larger transfer limits being introduced, credit unions can present an easy target for sophisticated attackers. Pressure to provide the same services as big banks is exposing them and their lack of cybersecurity and fraud capabilities. Shape Silverline Defense provides an affordable turnkey, easy-to-deploy managed security and fraud solution as evidenced by the 5 credit union wins our sales teams delivered in Q1 2021.
We are as excited as ever about the use cases Shape has opened for us. Going forward, we see additional potential to leverage Shape's analytics engine to build new analytics offerings that enable us to go beyond application security to drive revenue enhancements for customers.
Finally, let us talk about systems and the drivers for the growth we saw in Q1. First, I will note that our systems business is also benefiting from the macro trends I mentioned previously, namely COVID-driving increased application use and accelerating investment in digital transformation.
Q1 strength in systems was broad-based across geographies and industries. We identified 3 primary factors behind our strong systems performance. First, as we have discussed previously, we have seen growing demand for systems-based security use cases. Second, over the last several years, customers have gained clarity on their cloud strategies and now expect to operate in a hybrid multi-cloud world for some time to come. As a result, they are more willing to purchase systems to support capacity needs driven by accelerating digital transformation. We believe both of these drivers are sustainable. Third, Q1 also benefited from some COVID-suppressed systems catch-up. Customers who have put off systems purchases for several quarters simply can no longer defer growing capacity demands.
For a very small subset of our customers that had not refreshed in a long time, a long-planned April end-of-software development milestone on one of our legacy systems contributed to their desire to act sooner rather than later. For clarity, I would note that end-of-software development is very different than end of support.
In this case, the April milestone pertains to an end-of-software development date that has been well-publicized for years, providing customers a long planning runway. We estimate this catch-up demand drove approximately $10 million in system sales in Q1. We see this as a transient systems growth driver though we do expect it to carry over into Q2.
Finally, while I did not call it out as a growth driver, our expanded reach and role has also expanded our strategic position with customers. This has enhanced our ability to connect with C-level personas and also means we are more often considered for opportunities that span our application security and delivery portfolio, bridging traditional and modern applications in both hardware and software form factors.
As an example, in Q1, one of the United States' leading health care providers selected BIG-IP hardware, software, security and NGINX to keep the critical care applications running nonstop while beginning to migrate to next-generation apps for their care providers. This project reemerged as a priority for the customer after being deferred last February, so the customer can divert all necessary resources to fighting COVID.
In closing, we are encouraged by our momentum and believe we are seeing clear signs that our organic investments and our value-creation methodology for both NGINX and Shape are paying off for customers and investors alike. We were very pleased to announce that our acquisition of Volterra closed yesterday, and the team has already begun the hard work of integration. Initial customer feedback about the combination of F5 and Volterra has been very positive. Customers are excited about the potential of F5's edge 2.0 to eliminate the pain they feel from today's closed edge platforms.
Our edge 2.0 will be the first edge platform built for enterprises and service providers. It will be an open-edge platform that will allow every service to run on any server, virtual or otherwise, inclusive of public clouds. We are very excited to have the Volterra team as part of F5 and are looking forward to sharing our progress with you going forward.
I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 team again as well as our customers and our partners.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

But it isn't -- if you go back to the deals that were pushed out at the beginning of the pandemic, there were some software deals, we call them software transformation deals that were pushed out. And we're starting to see these come back, but not yet in a big way. So I think that's still ahead of us."

So I think if you look at where we're at today, Sami, there are 2 kind of macro things that are benefiting the company in general. Generally, there's more spending on applications infrastructure. And we have positioned ourselves to benefit from that. And I think that's a long-term effect.
There's also the effect of -- the company is strategically better positioned because of the combination of hardware and software and cloud solutions and security solutions that we have. And that allows us to have more strategic conversations with our customers and being seen as a future-proof partner for the strategic plans. And all of that benefits all of our business, including our systems business.
If you look at the drivers specifically to our systems business, there are 2 drivers that I think are long term and one that is more of a transient driver. So if you look specifically on the long term, we talked about at Analyst Day that our mix of security had grown, and that was helping our systems business. And this quarter, we saw again stronger growth in security than in the overall demand. The -- so that helps the systems business.
The second factor in our systems business is that, generally, we have some customers who -- if you recall, we talked about that 2, 3 years ago, customers who basically have said they were either going all-in on the cloud or they were essentially pausing their -- the systems business to reconsider their architecture for public cloud deployments. And I think a lot of customers were seeing have kind of graduated from that and now have a clear strategy around the cloud. They have maturity around knowing that they're going to operate in hybrid-cloud environments for a long time to come. And they're very comfortable moving forward with hardware as part of their long-term architecture. And so we're seeing some customers that have decided not to buy any more hardware at all that are coming back and now refreshing or adding capacity to their systems.
And so I think those 2 aspects are longer term, Sami. There is one transient driver, which is a subset of our customers that really had to make a refresh because it is end-of-software development. We think that was about $10 million in the quarter. We think that kind of carries on in Q2, but that's a really short-term demand.
So when you take all of that into account, Sami, we're not changing our Horizon 2 guidance, but yes, there is the possibility that our hardware business will do better in Horizon 2 than what we saw at AIM. We certainly think that for FY '21, it's likely to do better than what we had in our overall Horizon 2 guidance."

The aspects that have accelerated security for us relate more to, a, more customers moving to software and attaching more security use cases as they move to software. Same happening when they move to the public cloud, attaching more security in the public cloud environment.
And then with the addition of Shape, what we have seen, frankly, since the pandemic started, what we're still seeing today is as more and more businesses go to digital channels, that also attract more fraud. And so our offers for anti-fraud are seeing very strong demand.
I mentioned a couple of use cases in my prepared remarks, but that is across the board, large and small companies, there is more online fraud, and we're very well positioned to protect against that."

We are -- what's happening, Alex, is a lot of times, we think about traditional and modern applications in kind of separate silos. But the reality for large enterprises is they do a lot of application modernization. That is they will have a traditional application that is typically supported by BIG-IP. And as they modernize that application, they don't refactor it, but they add modern components to that application.
And these new modern component, typically microservices, NGINX is ideally suited to support these modern components. And so we're seeing that the combination of NGINX and BIG-IP gives a full solution set for these modernization initiatives that customers have, and it's pulling both NGINX and BIG-IP together.

And just generally, Tim, to the demand of software, yes, we will see still some variability, but the overall demand drivers for software are very strong. And I'll point to a couple. We had a all-high -- all-time high a number of multiyear subscription agreements in the quarter. A lot of these subscription agreements include multiple software solutions from F5, including NGINX. NGINX had the best quarter ever, and we're really seeing as customers start to really deploy these modern applications, NGINX growing very fast.
We also made some investments still, as you know, in NGINX, a year ago in the controller and app security, and we're seeing the effect of those in terms of growing the size of deals that we have. And the addressable deals that we can bring to the table.
And so when you factor that cloud, the number of subscription agreements, NGINX and some new catalysts that haven't played out yet, we have some catalysts around the true forwards in our subscriptions, some new use cases for Shape that are coming. So we feel very good about our software for Horizon."

You spoke, Francois, about people kind of having a little bit more of a framework of what their hybrid architectures look like. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, is there still a contingent of customers who were just kind of heads down and just trying to address the problems with their current architectures, and that could be kind of with the systems revenue for now.
And then just maybe some of the puts and takes on the lumpiness in the service provider revenue and just understanding some of that is project-based, but just maybe that tracking a little bit under traditional kind of percentage of revenue would be helpful."

What we're seeing, Meta, is our incumbency in a number of customers and the fact that we're operationalized, whether we're operationalized in hardware or in software is actually a significant advantage because we still see a lot of customers that continue to do incremental things, and we'll come back to bigger transformational projects later.

I think our improved strategic position with customers and the fact that they are more comfortable forward with a hardware purchase with F5 knowing that we are also their partner for software that were now also their partner for modern applications, that were also their partner for public cloud deployments, and they don't see F5 as a single-threaded horse, if you will, that's just a hardware partner, that is also providing an opportunity for -- opportunities to move forward even in hardware.
I would say those are the 2 major factors. The catch-up is just for some customers that have just tried to wait out, if you will, the pandemic to do some refresh. Some of them are moving forward. But I would say that's less of a factor than the first 2."

Now I will remind you that when we laid out our Horizon 2 guidance and the drivers of growth for F5, that are driving the 7% to 8% growth, there were 3 substantial drivers. The first one is continued momentum in software and software subscriptions, and we are continuing -- I mean, we posted 70% growth year-on-year this quarter. And we're going to continue to see very strong growth in software because the flywheel of subscriptions that we've put in motion now 2.5 years ago is really working well for us as a motion and for our customers.
The second driver is demand for application security, and we're seeing that also being very strong, boosted by the addition of Shape and the use cases that I've talked about.
And then the third driver was a moderation in our systems declines. And we had said at the time, it would moderate from double-digit to high to mid-single-digit decline.
Now we felt when we put the guidance together that not all 3 of these things have to go -- had to go perfectly for us to achieve the 7% to 8%. And so we have multiple paths of getting there. And right now, in this first quarter, essentially, there -- all 3 are pretty much going very well. So if that continues, I hope there's a possibility we do better than what we thought.

And in hardware, some of the drivers we're seeing that I've talked to are actually sustainable. There is a change there that we're seeing in how customers are approaching deployment of traditional applications in this hybrid-cloud environment. And the place that they're giving F5 in their go-forward plans and the strategic position we occupy now, I think that is sustainable.

Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be with you and to share with you our strong Q2 results.

I am pleased to be with you and to share with you our strong Q2 results. 
With a second consecutive quarter of 10% revenue growth and double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2, we are outperforming both our revenue and EPS goals. It is important to note that we achieved Q2 strong results with a different revenue mix than we expected early in the quarter. We delivered exceptional systems growth of 17%, while software growth was more muted than our expectation at 20%. During this call, we will discuss the market dynamics behind our product revenue mix in the quarter. 
The transformation we have worked persistently to achieve has put us at the center of applications, both traditional and modern, with a truly multi-cloud approach. As a result, we are benefiting from strong and sustainable macro growth drivers, ultimately powered by application growth. Business and consumers' increasing reliance on applications has accelerated all prior expectations about the pace of digital transformation. Our customers across the globe are scaling their digital assets faster, resulting in growing demand for F5's application security and delivery solutions. With our strong overall results, our conviction in our opportunity, both short and long term, is stronger than ever driven fundamentally by accelerating application growth. We feel very good about our future, given robust demand drivers and our strong and differentiated market position. 
I will turn the call over to Frank to walk you through our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook. Frank?"

As François just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Second quarter revenue of $645 million was up 10% year-over-year and at the top end of our guidance range. Please note as I rev",1005,"Thank you, François, and good afternoon, everyone. As François just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Second quarter revenue of $645 million was up 10% year-over-year and at the top end of our guidance range. Please note as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year ago period. 
Q2 product revenue of $309 million is up 18% year-over-year representing a significant acceleration from 10% in the same period last year and even more so from flat growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Product revenue accounted for approximately 48% of total revenue, up from 45% in the year ago period. The progress we are making, driving double-digit product revenue growth and the increasing mix of product revenue as a percentage of our total revenue, are both strong indicators of our transformation momentum and the long-term health of our business model. 
As François noted, we are seeing stronger-than-anticipated demand across the board. Short term, more of that demand is coming from systems, leading to the quarter's product revenue mix. Systems revenue of $201 million is up 17% compared to last year when systems were down 11%. Systems demand was higher than anticipated in the quarter, largely from broad-based increase in application usage and the corresponding increase in application traffic, continued growth of systems based security use cases as well as the emergence of 5G-driven service provider demand. Against a particularly tough 96% growth comparison in the prior year period, Q2 software revenue of $108 million is up 20% year-over-year, representing 35% of product revenue. 
We continue to drive our transition to a subscription-based model, delivering record subscription volume in Q2, with subscriptions representing 79% of software revenue in the quarter. This is up from 73% in the year ago period. Finally, our global services revenue of $336 million is up 4% compared to last year, representing 52% of revenue. 
Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue, totaled 64% of revenue in the quarter. 
On a regional basis in Q2, Americas delivered 6% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. Our EMEA and APAC teams drove strong growth in their regions, with EMEA delivering 16% growth, representing 27% of revenue, and APAC delivering 15% growth, accounting for 20% of revenue. 
The quarter's strength spanned customer verticals with especially strong demand from enterprise and telco. Enterprise customers represented 68% of product bookings; service providers and government customers each represented 16% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. federal from within the government vertical. 
Let me now share our Q2 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 80.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.4%, reflecting higher systems revenue as well as higher levels of managed service solutions and our usual Q2 seasonal decline in global services margins. GAAP operating expenses were $463 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $342 million, reflecting our usual Q2 operating expense seasonality and the addition of 2 months of Volterra-related operating expenses. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 8.3% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.2%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $43 million or $0.70 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $155 million or $2.50 per share. 
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $128.5 million in cash flow from operations in Q2. Cash and investments totaled approximately $662 million at quarter end, reflecting both the cash used for the Volterra acquisition and the initiation of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As a result of the ASR, we retired approximately $400 million of shares in Q2, reflecting 2.1 million shares purchased at an average price of $194.91 per share. We expect the remaining $100 million of ASR-related shares to be retired early in Q3. DSO was 52 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. Deferred revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 6,360 employees, up approximately 200 from Q1, in part as a result of the Volterra acquisition. 
Now let me share our guidance for our fiscal third quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support application growth and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on and investment in application security. It will come as no surprise that, like others in the industry, we are seeing some tightening in our supply chain. Thus far, our team has navigated it well, particularly given stronger than anticipated systems demand. Obviously, this is an industry-wide challenge. And like others, we have mitigation efforts in place, and we'll be watching it closely. With that as context, we are targeting Q3 fiscal year 2021 revenue in the range of $620 million to $650 million. We have accounted for the reduced supply chain visibility with a wider revenue range for our Q3 outlook, lowering the bottom end of our range by $10 million. While we do not expect to routinely provide product revenue mix guidance, we expect software growth for fiscal year 2021 will be at or around 35%, implying software growth in the back half of '21, exceeding what we delivered in Q2. Near term, we expect continued system strength with a slower growth rate likely in the fourth quarter. We expect Q3 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5% and we estimate operating expenses of $338 million to $352 million. We also expect to achieve our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 21%. Our Q3 earnings target is $2.36 to $2.54 per share. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $63 million to $65 million. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to François. François?"

The big takeaway from our Q2 results is that across the globe, our customers are experiencing a pronounced growth in application traffic, which in turn is driving increased opportunity for F5. Customers across geographies and verticals are experiencing application demand well ahead of initial expectations and timelines. This escalating demand is coming on the heels of a prolonged period of sweating assets in anticipation of cloud modernization efforts and more recently, pandemic-induced investment reprioritization. 
With no signs that application usage will slow, customers are urgently working to ensure they are able to support application traffic growth. The results for F5 is strong and sustainable overall demand for application security and delivery, as well as a temporary change in customer buying behavior, evident in our Q2 product revenue mix. 
I will stress that while we believe the opportunity around application demand is a long-term one for F5, we expect the current trend favoring hardware-based delivery models is short term. There remains a durable preference for software and SaaS-based application security and delivery that will once again be evident in our results over the next several quarters. 
So let us dig into the quarter's demand drivers. I will frame my discussion with the 3 growth drivers we discussed at our November 2020 Analyst Day. One, ongoing software and subscription momentum; two, systems-based demand; and three, growing demand for application security in both software and systems form factors. 
We continue to see rising demand for application security, and increasingly, F5 is seen by customers as an application security leader. In fact, Q2 was our highest security quarter yet, with strength spanning both systems and software form factors across both traditional and modern applications. Where application security is threaded through virtually all of our customer interactions, both software and systems, for the purposes of discussion today, as highlighted security use cases throughout both the software and systems form factor discussions. 
I will start our discussion with our software and subscription momentum, anchored on trends we are seeing with application-driven demand. Our growth in modern applications continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX container and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including API Gateway, Kubernetes synchronized controller and software-based load balancing. Customers' modernization efforts and the availability of NGINX Controller and enterprise level app security with NGINX App Protect, are also driving larger NGINX deal sizes as we anticipated. 
In one example, our sales team successfully layered NGINX controller with NGINX App Protect to enable one of the largest digital product companies in APAC to modernize more than 40 digital properties replacing multiple competitors with NGINX Plus with a App Protect and controller. As a result, the customer got a much better ROI in a long-term subscription framework. 
Customers are also increasingly aware and appreciative of NGINX's extreme versatility. For instance, during the quarter, we secured an NGINX win with a regulatory body in APAC. The customer was facing 2 distinct challenges. First, they needed to refresh their electronic payment systems. And second, they needed to deploy microservices in a VMware Kubernetes environment. NGINX proved the ideal solution for both. In the first instance, the customer moved from NGINX open source to NGINX Plus for the additional functionality and the added benefit of world-class global services support. In the second, they opted for a flexible subscription agreement, which gives them the ability to scale NGINX both as a software ADC and as a Kubernetes ingress controller as they grow their microservices. And they are using controller for visibility and manageability across all use cases. 
Of note, NGINX was the only true multi-cloud solution they found able to work in both a VMware environment and the cloud. With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, we also see continued demand for application security in cloud environments and rising demand for fraud and BoT defense. With our Shape anti-fraud and anti-BoT solutions, we are learning our win rate is best when there is significant automated traffic that can often circumvent traditional WAF protection. This is Shape's sweet spot. 
As an example, during Q2, a large credit union faced a massive credential stuffing attack, which their existing WAF could not defend. Shape could and did. 
While momentum in NGINX and modern application security software and use cases increased in Q2, we experienced a notable shift in customers' delivery preferences for application security and delivery for traditional workloads served by BIG-IP. We continue to see growing demand for BIG-IP software and multi-cloud environments, and expect the resumption of large-scale modernization efforts will remain a powerful growth driver for BIG-IP over time. 
Short term, however, we saw a mitigating factor to BIG-IP software demand, which paradoxically was driven by continued application growth. Facing escalating application traffic, several customers opted to refresh and augment their existing infrastructure instead of transitioning to software or a cloud environment. When asked, they explained that the systems form factor offered an expedient way to get the urgent capacity their applications and users needed in a well operationalized deployment motion. While cloud modernization and expansion are most certainly part of their future plans, they chose to deploy systems now. We expect this pattern with BIG-IP software is temporary and will moderate in the fourth quarter as customers resume BIG-IP software purchases in support of longer-term strategic projects and modernization efforts that COVID working conditions have made challenging. 
Stepping back, we continue to drive very positive software trends in the business. Our software subscription momentum continues with 79% of Q2 software revenue coming from subscription-based sales, up from 73% in the year ago quarter. In terms of volume, the number of multiyear subscription agreements were up 32% quarter-to-quarter and more than 200% compared to last year. 
In addition, while it is early still, we are beginning to hit some multiyear subscription renewals, and we are also seeing positive signs there. During Q2, we achieved a 100% renewal rates on the long-term subscription agreements that expired in the quarter. In addition, 75% of those renewals grew over prior levels. While we've yet to hit the inflection point for renewals, we are very encouraged by these early data points. In addition, we continue to see utilization improvements. Our Q2 customer success metrics show long-term subscription customers are achieving 100% utilization sooner than ever before. 
Turning to systems. Part of F5's value proposition is our ability to offer our customers enterprise-grade application security and delivery solutions in multiple form factors, systems, software and increasingly going forward, Saas. As I just discussed, sudden and rapidly accelerating growth in application usage led to accelerated customer demand for systems in Q2. 
Last quarter, we articulated several systems demand drivers. Another quarter in, we believe we have additional clarity around the drivers of our systems growth, and we can break them into 2 broad categories: one, accelerating application traffic; and two, security, including emerging 5G-driven demand. 
To a large extent, I have already spoken to the accelerating application traffic. With surging application consumption, customers have urgent capacity demands to fulfill. As a result, several customers are opting to refresh and augment their infrastructure at a faster rate than we anticipated. Of note, they are doing so without a new systems platform from us. In some cases, the deployments coincide with the end of software development date we discussed last quarter. But broadly speaking, the underlying driver is the need for application security and delivery capabilities to deal with escalating application usage. 
We are seeing demand span geographies and customer verticals from financial services to technology to global SaaS providers. As a case in point, one of our biggest systems deployments this quarter was with one of the planet's largest cloud-based software companies looking to build a scale model for organic growth and the scale within their existing systems architecture. Similarly, last quarter, we had a sizable system deployment with one of the largest tech giants in support of their global web-based collaboration platform and they scaled with their existing systems architecture. These are cutting-edge players, and in all likelihood, they will be among the first to move to software and cloud-based infrastructures in the future. However, today, because of the confluence of demand, the complexities of deploying and scaling in the cloud and the challenges of taking on transformative projects in a COVID-influenced environment, they are solving their application and deliver challenges with systems from F5. 
Wrapping up our growth drivers discussion, let's talk about systems-based application security, including a new driver, emerging 5G demand. As we have said for several quarters now, our systems business is benefiting from increasing demand for security use cases. Cross-sell of application security is driving systems growth as more customers look to consolidate vendors and combine ADC and application security functionality. Among enterprise and government customers, we also are seeing strong demand for web application firewall and continued strength in identity and SSL orchestration. 
The new driver that developed this quarter is emerging service provider 5G demand. We expected that as 5G traffic began to flow from the radio edge into service providers' 4G core networks, we will benefit from increased demand given our strong position in 4G Gi LAN infrastructures. 
We initially and conservatively estimated 5G-related demand would begin to materialize in late 2021 or early 2022. In Q2, we secured several Gi LAN expansion projects, including a large Gi LAN firewall expansion with a North American carrier. These wins and other active opportunities suggest that we are, in fact, beginning to see the emergence of 4G core expansion driven by 5G demand. 
So what does all of this mean for our business and growth going forward? Fundamentally, we expect customers to transition to more software and SaaS-based solutions over time. We are confident that the investments we have made, both organic and inorganic and forward momentum our teams are driving, position F5 as a significant beneficiary of that transition. This is true in the short term. As Frank said, we expect our software growth in fiscal year 2021 to be at or about 35%. And it is also true in the long term as software and SaaS-based revenue accounts for a more sizable portion of our total revenue. 
We expect demand for application security will continue to grow as application demand grows and customers scale and modernize their applications. We believe that we are exceptionally well placed with the right perspective and tool set to solve our customers' most pressing application security challenges. Our opportunity in application security is even more exciting with the ongoing integration of F5 and Volterra, which will bring enterprise-grade F5 application security to the edge in an easily deployable SaaS model. We expect the recent high-growth rates we have seen from BIG-IP systems will begin to moderate in the second half of this year. And we expect service providers 5G-related demand will likely begin to migrate from systems to software in 2022 as their 5G cores start to hit production. In the meantime, we see demand for systems-based application security persisting over multiple quarters. 
Before I close our prepared remarks, I will say a few brief words about Volterra and our integration process. We launched our integration and value-creation efforts immediately following the acquisition close on January 22. We are thrilled to have Ankur Singla and the Volterra team as part of our security organization, led by Song. While we have work ahead, we are very pleased with the initial positive customer response. Early indicators show our vision of F5's Edge 2.0 is resonating with customers. We have started a pilot program concentrating on specific use cases and focused on bringing F5 security to the edge with the goal of leveraging Volterra's organic momentum and early customer interest. Through this pilot, we will develop new business as well as derive customer behavior insights. 
As the first step in our long-term integration of F5 Solutions and Volterra's platform, we have begun the process of strategically and methodically combining our best in web application and API protection security offerings and Volterra's innovative platform. We are also formulating our go-to-market approach and exploring ways to maximize the benefits with our channel partners. Only a few months into this integration, we are even more excited about the potential of this combination as we move into FY '22. We will continue to share our progress with you in the coming quarters. 
I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 team again as well as our customers and partners. In particular, our thoughts are with the F5 team in India, their families and loved ones as they endure the extreme health risk and loss of life occurring there as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. 
With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

There is -- we have a strong pipeline of software deals, both for NGINX and for BIG-IP that will materialize in the second half of the year. What we did see this quarter -- so if you look at the software growth drivers, Jim, we talked about 3 growth drivers on software. And in that order, one is modern applications. Second one is security. And the third one is BIG-IP deployments in multi-cloud. 
The first growth driver around modern applications is going very well, largely driven by NGINX, exceeding our expectations and driven by the addition of a controller and security on NGINX and more and more customers deploying modern applications in these cloud-native and container-native environments. 
The second driver of security also going to plan with more and more customers deploying security, either in these modern application environments or on top of traditional applications, both in systems, but also in software form factors. The third driver of software growth is really the deployments of BIG-IP into multi-cloud environments and specifically some customers migrating from systems to software-first or cloud-first environment. 
And whilst we see continued growth on those BIG-IP deployments, what we did see this quarter is a bit of a moderation as -- on that specific driver as customers that really need to increase the capacity to support application usage and application growth. A lot of them chose the most expedient way to deploy that capacity, which is in hardware, where they're operationalized. And don't have the -- either the time or the mechanism right now because of the COVID environment to go and think about re-architecting things and moving to software.

If I had to quantify it, I think it's probably about the same as it was last quarter, but there are a lot of other factors that went into the strength of hardware."

Where we are really pleased is we are seeing more and more customers of F5 adopt multiple elements of our portfolio. And so more and more of the multiyear-term subscription agreements that we are selling, have multiple products from F5. And it's allowing us to elevate the conversation with our customers, really continue to elevate the position of F5 in a lot of these large accounts. And we're really pleased with the traction of these agreements. 
In fact, as a data point, the software multiyear subscription agreements were up 200% year-on-year in terms of the volume of transactions that we completed this quarter relative to Q2 of 2020. And this points to the number of our customers that are moving to these term subscription agreements where they can easily consume multiple of our products. 
In terms specifically of our progress on the new point solutions, I think Volterra is too -- it's really too early for us to speak to that because we're basically through the integration, porting our capabilities onto the Volterra platform, including our security. So it's more over the next few quarters that we'll be able to speak to deals that are coming through on Volterra. And then on Shape specifically, where -- we are pleased with the value proposition. I mean, the customers that use Shape are extremely pleased with the efficacy of the solution. It is best-in-class. A lot of times, we see customers who are actually already have solutions perhaps from another vendor, like a CDN vendor, but they're still under attack. And we come in with Shape and have a higher efficacy solution and can solve those attacks as a point solution. 
Where we are seeing things take longer than we would have liked is in the COVID environment, when you have to go through a proof of concept, mechanically, it's actually difficult to go through with. And we're finding that in this environment, being incumbent and operationalized is a big advantage. But when you're trying to introduce a new solution that requires a proof of concept, the sales cycle is a bit elongated and it takes a little bit of time. And I would say that overall is the picture on cross-selling the various elements of the portfolio."

So generally, we feel it would be really early to make any change to our Horizon 2 guidance. But I think the -- what we can say is a couple of things. I think we are definitely seeing those trends of application usage go up significantly as a result of most of us, frankly, consuming more things online. And so more and more of our customers see more usage on their application, whether they are traditional enterprises or even cloud providers. As you know, we are embedded in SaaS provider stack or even cloud providers. I think you've heard me say before that somebody's cloud is somebody else's data center. And we are in those stacks, and a number of our cloud provider customers are seeing escalating demand for their solutions, and they have to grow the capacity as a result, and we're benefiting from that directly. 
So we're definitely seeing that. As a result of that, we can definitely say that our hardware for 2021 will be in positive growth territory for sure, given what we've seen. And even for Horizon 2, the performance of our systems will be materially better than what we thought it would be at the beginning of the Horizon. I think those are the things we can say. There's a little bit of uncertainty we're dealing with, with the supply chain challenges that all vendors, I think, are seeing at the moment. So we're a little cautious about that. And we shared in the prepared remarks -- I think Frank shared, that we took that into account a little bit in our guidance range. But in terms of the underlying demand, it is very strong."

So let me just start with the second part of your question on software growth in the second half, and then I'll come back to the first part. On the -- so in terms of the second half of the year in software, Tim, there are a number of catalysts and drivers that have continued to gain strength. I talked about NGINX a little earlier, but these modern apps environment, we see them continue to grow. We have, in fact, a number of subscription agreements in the pipeline. But I would say the predominant factor is that the volume of software, multiyear subscription agreements that we are signing is just growing extremely rapidly. They grew -- sequentially from Q1 to Q2, they grew roughly 30%. But if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, the volume of subscription agreements was up to 100%. And it just continues in that direction. So we're getting visibility to this. 
We're, at some point, we're going to hit also the inflection point on renewals of these subscription agreements. We're not quite there. We think that's more of a 2022 effect, but even what we're seeing today from the renewal rates of the ones that are coming to term and the true forward on the ones that have more than a year in maturity, those metrics are just excellent at the moment. So these catalysts are important. Security continues to be a growth driver and a catalyst for growth in software. And then the cloud. 
And I want to come back to the first part of your question. The cloud continues to be a growth driver for our software. However, this quarter, it was a little less in terms of the growth rate. And the reason for that is because we think that there was a moderation in the number of customers migrating applications to the public cloud. And specifically, migrating more of these traditional applications to the cloud. And we think this is back to the effect we're seeing on our hardware business where customers really sweated their assets for a long period of time, saying, ""Hey, we don't want to deploy any more hardware because we're going to migrate to the cloud"". And what we're finding is a lot of them, after having sweated their assets for a long time, are caught with increase in capacity needs that they have to serve very quickly. And the -- operationally, the best and the easiest way to do that is to actually go with hardware. And so that, we think -- and when you factor on top of that, the fact that we're in a COVID environment that moving from hardware to software or moving from hardware to cloud requires either re-architecture or working in collaboration across multiple teams, which is much more difficult to affect in this environment, then we're seeing that less customers are able to do that at the moment. We think over time that the trend will continue towards these cloud migrations. But this quarter, it was a little more muted."

In terms of what this means longer term, frankly, it's too early to predict beyond Horizon 2. I would say in terms of the hardware ADC space, we think hardware ADCs, per se, those are in secular decline and should decline and continue to decline over time beyond Horizon 2. We're not seeing that in hardware security today. We continue to see growth in hardware security, and that represents more of a mix for us. So too early to make a determination in terms of what's happening beyond 2022. 
Specifically when it comes to service providers, what we are seeing, Samik, is right now, a lot of carriers have put in place their 5G radio -- as you know, the first smartphones with 5G have come out in the fourth quarter of 2020. A lot of the spectrum auctions have happened. And so we're now starting to see utilization of 5G from the devices into the radio, and that is coming into the carrier core networks. Now most of these carrier core networks are still 4G and we have a very strong presence in a lot of these infrastructure. And so the capacity requirements are fulfilled by 4G capacity upgrades. And that's providing tailwind to our hardware business, and I expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters, probably a little longer. 
Now if you go into 2022, a lot of these carriers will start to put in production, their 5G core, and those are virtualized. And so that opportunity will turn into a software opportunity for F5. And we have already -- already won significant design wins for these 5G cores and we're in the process of doing first office applications and pilots and things like that before going into production in the next 6 to 12 months. So it's a hardware expansion opportunity today. And over the next 12 months, it will move to be a software opportunity in 5G cores for F5."

And taking into account what I talked about in regards to just some less visibility than we would normally like on some of the supply chain components. We wanted to make sure that we gave the additional room of the $10 million on the low end. And so that's a result of the range. In a perfect world, it would still be that $20 million range, but we just wanted to be cautious with our outlook."

There will continue to be variability. Where we start to see a lot more clarity is when we start to lap some of the multiyear subscription agreements and the bulk of that is going to happen in the back half of FY '22. And so we do have 4 more quarters of what I would say variability. I don't think the choppiness will be what you saw between Q1 and Q2 of this year, that we will continue to have some variability in that but starting in that lapping period. And then frankly, the denominator just gets so much bigger. So you don't have things that swing. We will start to see so that as well. With the SaaS piece of the subscription continuing to grow as well. This is more -- when we take a look even beyond Horizon 2, that will become a lot more ratable in that factor and smooth things out. And so we do have some more choppiness ahead of us, but I think things really do start to smooth out when we take a look at the back half of '22 and beyond."

One, of course, is that, as Frank just alluded to, it was a high comp relative to last year. But yes, the other primary factor is customers that paused are moderated on migrations to software due to operational constraints. And that is reflected in the higher hardware number and a lower software growth number. And that is very specific to BIG-IP. It's not specific -- so in the other aspects of our software portfolio around NGINX and security, we had very strong growth. In fact, NGINX grew faster than overall product revenue again. 
But specifically with BIG-IP, the softness, if you will, in software there, is directly correlated to customers choosing unexpectedly to us, and it was a little bit of a surprise to us choosing to go to a hardware form factor instead of a software form factor in a number of cases. I would also add, Paul, that when you step back and you look at that, the overall demand for F5 technology is very strong. And as these customers continue to deploy BIG-IP, it increases our footprint. And when they do migrate to software, they will migrate with us. We've already proven that for the last 3 years. They won't migrate on a BIG-IP software form factor. So for those customers that did that, it is a temporary delay in them moving to software. But there's absolutely there a substitute to effect of customers pausing on software, going more on hardware because they were a little caught by surprise by the surge in application demand. And given the COVID environment and the inability to rearchitect and work across teams to go to software, we chose to continue and deploy hardware form factors."

And the growth in the number of customers, we have continued to see growth in the number of customers. I would say that growth, specifically the growth in ARR with Shape this quarter wasn't as strong as we wanted. And that's largely because we -- I was saying earlier that for customers for which we need to do a proof-of-concept in the current environment, for the same reasons that in some ways, are keeping customers on hardware on the BIG-IP, effecting a proof-of-concept when people are not in the office and have to work across teams and collaborate and connect different systems together for proof-of-concepts to happen, it's operationally a little more complicated. It takes more time, and it takes more motivation for customers to go and do that. 
And so when customers are in significant pain and they are under attack, it moves extremely quickly. When they're not, it doesn't move as fast as we want to. And that's part of what we saw this quarter with Shape. But overall, when you look at the efficacy of the solution and the satisfaction of customers and the way in which it's blocking an increasingly high number of automated attacks, we're very, very happy. And we think this thing about the difficulty of operationalizing proof-of-concept and getting through a sales cycle is really a temporary thing with the COVID that will go away down the road."

I am pleased to be with you and to share with you our strong Q2 results. With a second consecutive quarter of 10% revenue growth and double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth in Q2, we are outperforming both our revenue and EPS goals. It is important to note that we achieved Q2's strong results with a different revenue mix than we expected early in the quarter. We delivered exceptional systems growth of 17%, while software growth was more muted than our expectation at 20%. During this call, we will discuss the market dynamics behind our product revenue mix in the quarter.
The transformation we have worked persistently to achieve has put us at the center of applications, both traditional and modern, with a truly multi-cloud approach. As a result, we are benefiting from strong and sustainable macro growth drivers ultimately powered by application growth. Business and consumers' increasing reliance on applications has accelerated all prior expectations about the pace of digital transformation. Our customers across the globe are scaling their digital assets faster, resulting in growing demand for F5's application security and delivery solutions. With our strong overall results, our conviction in our opportunity, both short and long term, is stronger than ever, driven fundamentally by accelerating application growth.

As François just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Second quarter revenue of $645 million was up 10% year-over-year and at the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year ago period.
Q2 product revenue of $309 million is up 18% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from 10% in the same period last year and even more so from flat growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Product revenue accounted for approximately 48% of total revenue, up from 45% in the year ago period. The progress we are making driving double-digit product revenue growth and the increasing mix of product revenue as a percentage of our total revenue are both strong indicators of our transformation momentum and the long-term health of our business model. As François noted, we are seeing stronger-than-anticipated demand across the board. Short term, more of that demand is coming from systems, leading to the quarter's product revenue mix.
Systems revenue of $201 million is up 17% compared to last year, when systems were down 11%. Systems demand was higher than anticipated in the quarter, largely from broad-based increase in application usage and the corresponding increase in application traffic, continued growth of systems-based security use cases as well as the emergence of 5G-driven service provider demand. Against a particularly tough 96% growth comparison in the prior year period, Q2 software revenue of $108 million is up 20% year-over-year, representing 35% of product revenue.
We continue to drive our transition to a subscription-based model, delivering record subscription volume in Q2, with subscriptions representing 79% of software revenue in the quarter. This is up from 73% in the year ago period. Finally, our global services revenue of $336 million is up 4% compared to last year, representing 52% of revenue. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions, as-a-service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue, totaled 64% of revenue in the quarter.
On a regional basis in Q2, Americas delivered 6% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. Our EMEA and APAC teams drove strong growth in their regions, with EMEA delivering 16% growth, representing 27% of revenue; and APAC delivering 15% growth, accounting for 20% of revenue.
The quarter's strength spanned customer verticals, with especially strong demand from enterprise and telco. Enterprise customers represented 68% of product bookings. Service providers and government customers each represented 16% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. federal from within the government vertical.
Let me now share our Q2 operating results.
GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 80.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.4%, reflecting higher systems revenue as well as higher levels of managed service solutions and our usual Q2 seasonal decline in global services margins. GAAP operating expenses were $463 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $342 million, reflecting our usual Q2 operating expense seasonality and the addition of 2 months of Volterra-related operating expenses. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 8.3%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.3%.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.2%.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $43 million or $0.70 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $155 million or $2.50 per share.
I will now turn to the balance sheet.
We generated $128.5 million in cash flow from operations in Q2. Cash and investments totaled approximately $662 million at quarter end, reflecting both the cash used for the Volterra acquisition and the initiation of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As a result of the ASR, we retired approximately $400 million of shares in Q2, reflecting 2.1 million shares purchased at an average price of $194.91 per share. We expect the remaining $100 million of ASR-related shares to be retired early in Q3.
DSO was 52 days. And capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. Deferred revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.
We ended the quarter with approximately 6,360 employees, up approximately 200 from Q1, in part as a result of the Volterra acquisition.
Now let me share our guidance for our fiscal third quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics.
Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support application growth and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on and investment in application security. It will come as no surprise that, like others in the industry, we are seeing some tightening in our supply chain. Thus far, our team has navigated it well, particularly given stronger-than-anticipated systems demand. Obviously this is an industry-wide challenge, and like others, we have mitigation efforts in place and we'll be watching it closely.
With that as context, we are targeting Q3 fiscal year 2021 revenue in the range of $620 million to $650 million. We have accounted for the reduced supply chain visibility with a wider revenue range for our Q3 outlook, lowering the bottom end of our range by $10 million. While we do not expect to routinely provide product revenue mix guidance, we expect software growth for fiscal year 2021 will be at or around 35%, implying software growth in the back half of '21 exceeding what we delivered in Q2. Near term, we expect continued systems strength, with a slower growth rate likely in the fourth quarter.
We expect Q3 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5%, and we estimate operating expenses of $338 million to $352 million. We also expect to achieve our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 21%.
Our Q3 earnings target is $2.36 to $2.54 per share. We expect Q3 share-based compensation expense of approximately $63 million to $65 million.
With that, I will turn the call back over to François.

The big takeaway from our Q2 results is that, across the globe, our customers are experiencing a pronounced growth in application traffic, which in turn is driving increased opportunity for F5. Customers across geographies and verticals are experiencing application demand well ahead of initial expectations and time lines. This escalating demand is coming on the heels of a prolonged period of sweating assets in anticipation of cloud modernization efforts and more recently pandemic-induced investment reprioritization. With no signs that application usage will slow, customers are urgently working to ensure they are able to support application traffic growth. The result for F5 is strong and sustainable overall demand for application security and delivery as well as a temporary change in customer buying behavior, evident in our Q2 product revenue mix. I will stress that, while we believe the opportunity around application demand is a long-term one for F5, we expect the current trend favoring hardware-based delivery models is short term. There remain a durable preference for software- and SaaS-based application security and delivery that will once again be evident in our results over the next several quarters.
So let us dig into the quarter's demand drivers. I will frame my discussion with the 3 growth drivers we discussed at our November 2020 Analyst Day: one, ongoing software and subscription momentum; two, systems-based demand; and three, growing demand for application security in both software and systems form factors.
We continue to see rising demand for application security, and increasingly, F5 is seen by customers as an application security leader. In fact, Q2 was our highest security quarter yet, with strength spanning both systems and software form factors across both traditional and modern applications. Where application security is [ threaded through ] virtually all of our customer interactions, both software and systems, for the purposes of discussion today, I've highlighted security use cases throughout both the software and systems form factor discussions. I will start our discussion with our software and subscription momentum anchored on trends we are seeing with application-driven demand.
Our growth in modern applications continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX container and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including API gateway, Kubernetes synchronized controller and software-based load balancing. Customers' modernization efforts and the availability of NGINX Controller and enterprise-level app security with NGINX App Protect are also driving larger NGINX deal sizes as we anticipated. In one example, our sales team successfully layered NGINX Controller with NGINX App Protect to enable one of the largest digital product companies in APAC to modernize more than 40 digital properties, replacing multiple competitors with NGINX Plus with app protect and controller. As a result, the customer got a much better ROI in a long-term subscription framework.
Customers are also increasingly aware and appreciative of NGINX' extreme versatility. For instance, during the quarter, we secured an NGINX win with a regulatory body in APAC. The customer was facing 2 distinct challenges. First, they needed to refresh their electronic payment systems. And second, they needed to deploy microservices in a VMware Tanzu Kubernetes environment. NGINX proved the ideal solution for both. In the first instance, the customer moved from NGINX Open Source to NGINX Plus for the additional functionality and the added benefit of world-class global services support. In the second, they opted for a flexible subscription agreement which gives them the ability to scale NGINX both as a software ADC and as a Kubernetes ingress controller as they grow their microservices. And they are using controller for visibility and manageability across both use cases. Of note, NGINX was the only true multi-cloud solution they found able to work in both a VMware environment and the cloud.
With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, we also see continued demand for application security in cloud environments and rising demand for fraud and bot defense. With our Shape anti-fraud and anti-bot solutions, we are learning our win rate is best when there is significant automated traffic that can often circumvent traditional WAF protection. This is Shape's sweet spot. As an example, during Q2, a large credit union faced a massive credential stuffing attack, which their existing WAF could not defend. Shape could and did.
While momentum in NGINX and modern application security software use cases increased in Q2, we experienced a notable shift in customers' delivery preferences for application security and delivery for traditional workloads served by BIG-IP. We continue to see growing demand for BIG-IP software in multi-cloud environments and expect the resumption of large-scale modernization efforts will remain a powerful growth driver for BIG-IP over time. Short term, however, we saw a mitigating factor to BIG-IP software demand which paradoxically was driven by continued application growth. Facing escalating application traffic, several customers opted to refresh and augment their existing infrastructure instead of transitioning to software or a cloud environment. When asked, they explain that the systems form factor offered an expedient way to get the urgent capacity their applications and users needed in a well-operationalized deployment motion. While cloud modernization and expansion are most certainly part of their future plans, they chose to deploy systems now. We expect this pattern with BIG-IP software is temporary and will moderate in the fourth quarter as customers resume BIG-IP software purchases in support of longer-term strategic projects and modernization efforts that COVID working conditions have made challenging.
Stepping back. We continue to drive very positive software trends in the business. Our software subscription momentum continues, with 79% of Q2 software revenue coming from subscription-based sales, up from 73% in the year ago quarter. In terms of volume, the number of multiyear subscription agreements were up 32% quarter-to-quarter and more than 200% compared to last year. In addition, while it is early still, we are beginning to hit some multiyear subscription renewals, and we are also seeing positive signs there. During Q2, we achieved a 100% renewal rates on the long-term subscription agreements that expired in the quarter. In addition, 75% of those renewals grew over prior levels. While we've yet to hit the inflection point for renewals, we are very encouraged by these early data points. In addition, we continue to see utilization improvements. Our Q2 customer success metrics show long-term subscription customers are achieving 100% utilization sooner than ever before.
Turning to systems. Part of F5's value proposition is our ability to offer our customers enterprise-grade application security and delivery solutions in multiple form factors, systems; software; and increasingly, going forward, SaaS. As I just discussed, sudden and rapidly accelerating growth in application usage led to accelerated customer demand for systems in Q2. Last quarter, we articulated several systems demand drivers. Another quarter in, we believe we have additional clarity around the drivers of our systems growth and we can break them into 2 broad categories: one, accelerating application traffic; and two, security, including emerging 5G-driven demand.
To a large extent, I have already spoken to the accelerating application traffic. With surging application consumption, customers have urgent capacity demands to fulfill. As a result, several customers are opting to refresh and augment their infrastructure at a faster rate than we anticipated. Of note, they are doing so without a new systems platform from us. In some cases, the deployments coincide with the ""end of software development"" date we discussed last quarter, but broadly speaking, the underlying driver is the need for application security and delivery capabilities to deal with escalating application usage.
We are seeing demand span geographies and customer verticals, from financial services to technology, to global SaaS providers. As a case in point, one of our biggest systems deployments this quarter was with one of the planet's largest cloud-based software companies looking to build a scale model for organic growth and the scale within their existing systems architecture. Similarly, last quarter, we had a sizable system deployment with one of the largest tech giants in support of their global web-based collaboration platform, and they scaled with their existing systems architecture. These are cutting-edge players, and in all likelihood, they will be among the first to move to software and cloud-based infrastructures in the future. However, today, because of the confluence of demand, the complexities of deploying and scaling in the cloud and the challenges of taking on transformative projects in a COVID-influenced environment, they are solving their application and delivery challenges with systems from F5.
Wrapping up our growth drivers discussion, let's talk about systems-based application security, including a new driver, emerging 5G demand. As we have said for several quarters now, our systems business is benefiting from increasing demand for security use cases. Cross-sell of application security is driving systems growth as more customers look to consolidate vendors and combine ADC and application security functionality. Among enterprise and government customers, we also are seeing strong demand for web application firewall and continued strength in identity and SSL orchestration.
The new driver that developed this quarter is emerging service provider 5G demand. We expected that, as 5G traffic began to flow from the radio edge into service providers' 4G core networks, we will benefit from increased demand given our strong position in 4G Gi LAN infrastructures. We initially and conservatively estimated 5G-related demand would begin to materialize in late 2021 or early 2022. In Q2, we secured several Gi LAN expansion projects, including a large Gi LAN firewall expansion with a North American carrier. These wins and other active opportunities suggest that we are in fact beginning to see the emergence of 4G core expansion driven by 5G demand.
So what does all of this mean for our business and growth going forward? Fundamentally, we expect customers to transition to more software- and SaaS-based solutions over time. We are confident that the investments we have made, both organic and inorganic, and forward momentum our teams are driving position F5 as a significant beneficiary of that transition. This is true in the short term. As Frank said, we expect our software growth in fiscal year 2021 to be at or about 35%. And it is also true in the long term as software- and SaaS-based revenue account for a more sizable portion of our total revenue.
We expect demand for application security will continue to grow as application demand grows and customers scale and modernize their applications. We believe that we are exceptionally well placed with the right perspective and tool set to solve our customers' most pressing application security challenges. Our opportunity in application security is even more exciting with the ongoing integration of F5 and Volterra, which will bring enterprise-grade F5 application security to the edge in an easily deployable SaaS model. We expect the recent high growth rates we have seen from BIG-IP systems will begin to moderate in the second half of this year. And we expect service providers' 5G-related demand will likely begin to migrate from systems to software in 2022 as their 5G cores start to hit production. In the meantime, we see demand for systems-based application security persisting over multiple quarters.
Before I close our prepared remarks, I will say a few brief words about Volterra and our integration process. We launched our integration and value creation efforts immediately following the acquisition close on January 22. We are thrilled to have Ankur Singla and the Volterra team as part of our security organization, led by Haiyan Song.
While we have work ahead, we are very pleased with the initial positive customer response. Early indicators show our vision of F5's Edge 2.0 is resonating with customers. We have started a pilot program concentrating on specific use cases and focused on bringing F5 security to the edge, with the goal of leveraging Volterra's organic momentum and early customer interest. Through this pilot, we will develop new business as well as derive customer behavior insights.
As the first step in our long-term integration of F5's solutions and Volterra's platform, we have begun the process of strategically and methodically combining our best in web application and API protection security offerings and Volterra's innovative platform. We are also formulating our go-to-market approach and exploring ways to maximize the benefits with our channel partners. Only a few months into this integration, we are even more excited about the potential of this combination as we move into FY '22. We will continue to share our progress with you in the coming quarters.
I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 team again as well as our customers and partners. In particular, our thoughts are with the F5 team in India, their families and loved ones as they endure the extreme health risk and loss of life occurring there as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

There is -- we have a strong pipeline of software deals both for NGINX and for BIG-IP that will materialize in the second half of the year. What we did see this quarter -- so if you look at the software growth drivers, Jim, we talked about 3 growth drivers on software. And in that order, one is modern applications. Second one is security, and the third one is BIG-IP deployments in multi cloud. The first growth driver, around modern applications, is going very well, largely driven by NGINX exceeding our expectations and driven by the addition of the controller and security on NGINX and more and more customers deploying modern applications in these cloud-native and container-native environments. The second driver of security, also going to plan with more and more customers deploying security either in these modern application environments or on top of traditional applications both in systems but also in software form factors.
The third driver of software growth is really the deployments of BIG-IP into multi-cloud environments and specifically some customers migrating from systems to software-first or cloud-first environments. And whilst we see continued growth on those BIG-IP deployments, what we did see this quarter is a bit of a moderation as -- on that specific driver as, customers that really need to increase their capacity to support application usage and application growth, a lot of them chose the most expedient way to deploy that capacity, which is in hardware where they're operationalized; and don't have the -- either the time or the mechanism right now, because of the COVID environment, to go and think about re-architecting things and moving to software. We do think that, that will resume in fairly short order, so we're very confident about software growth both for the second half of the year and for 2022."

Where we are really pleased is we are seeing more and more customers of F5 adopt multiple elements of our portfolio. And so more and more of the multiyear term subscription agreements that we are selling have multiple products from F5. And it's allowing us to elevate the conversation with our customers, really continue to elevate the position of F5 in a lot of these large accounts. And we're really pleased with the traction of these agreements. In fact, as a data point: The software multiyear subscription agreements were up 200% year-on-year in terms of the volume of transactions that we completed this quarter relative to Q2 of 2020. And this points to the number of our customers that are moving to these term subscription agreements where they can easily consume multiple of our products.
In terms specifically of our progress on the new point solutions, I think Volterra is too -- it's really too early for us to speak to that because we're basically still through the integration, porting our capabilities onto the Volterra platform, including our security, so it's more over the next few quarters that we'll be able to speak to deals that are coming through on Volterra. And then on Shape specifically, where -- we are pleased with the value proposition. I mean the customers that use Shape are extremely pleased with the efficacy of the solution. It is best in class. A lot of times, we see customers who are -- actually already have solutions perhaps from another vendor, like a CDN vendor, but they're still under attack. And we come in with Shape and have a higher efficacy solution and can solve those attacks, as a point solution. Where we are seeing things take longer than we would have liked is in the COVID environment. When you have to go through a proof of concept and -- mechanically it's actually difficult to go through with. And we're finding that, in this environment, being incumbent and operationalized is a big advantage, but when you're trying to introduce a new solution that requires a proof of concept, the sales cycle is a bit elongated and it takes a little bit of time. And I will say that overall is the picture on cross-selling the various elements of the portfolio."

We are 2 quarters into that, so [ generally ] we feel it would be really early to make any change to our Horizon 2 guidance, but I think the what we can say is a couple of things. I think we are definitely seeing those trends of application usage go up significantly as a result of most of us, frankly, consuming more things online. And so more and more of our customers see more usage on their application, whether they are traditional enterprises or even cloud providers. As you know, we are embedded in SaaS provider stack or even cloud providers. I think you've heard me say before that somebody's cloud is somebody else's data center, and we are in those stacks. And a number of our cloud provider customers are seeing escalating demand for their solutions and they have to grow their capacity as a result, and we're benefiting from that directly. So we're definitely seeing that.
As a result of that, we can definitely say that our hardware for 2021 will be in positive growth territory, for sure, given what we've seen. And even for Horizon 2, the performance of our systems will be materially better than what we thought it would be at the beginning of the Horizon. And I think those are the things we can say. There's a little bit of uncertainty we're dealing with, with the supply chain challenges that all vendors, I think, are seeing at the moment, so we're a little cautious about that. And we shared in the prepared remarks, I think Frank shared, that we took that into account a little bit in our guidance range, but in terms of the underlying demand, it is very strong."

So let me just start with the second part of your question, on software growth in the second half, and then I'll come back to the first part. On the -- so in terms of the second half of the year in software, Tim, there are a number of catalysts and drivers that have continued to gain strength. I talked about NGINX a little earlier, but these modern apps environment, we see them continue to grow. We have in fact a number of subscription agreements in the pipeline, but I would say the predominant factor is that the volume of software multiyear subscription agreements that we are signing is just growing extremely rapidly. They grew -- sequentially from Q1 to Q2, they grew roughly 30%, but if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, the volume of subscription agreements was up 200%. And it just continues in that direction. So we're getting visibility to this. We're -- at some point, we're going to hit also the inflection point on renewals of these subscription agreements. We're not quite there. We think that's more of a 2022 effect, but even what we're seeing today from the renewal rates of the ones that are coming to term and the true forward on the ones that have more than a year in maturity, those metrics are just excellent at the moment. So these catalysts are important. Security continues to be a growth driver and a catalyst for growth in software and then the cloud. And I want to come back to the first part of your question.
The cloud continues to be a growth driver for our software. However, this quarter, it was a little less in terms of the growth rate. And the reason for that is because we think that there was a moderation in the number of customers migrating applications to the public cloud and specifically migrating more of these traditional applications to the cloud. And we think this is back to the effect we're seeing on our hardware business, where customers really sweated their assets for a long period of time, saying, ""Hey, we don't want to deploy any more hardware because we're going to migrate to the cloud"". And what we're finding is a lot of them, after having sweated their assets for a long time, are caught with increase in capacity needs that they have to serve very quickly. And the -- operationally, the best and the easiest way to do that is to actually go with hardware. And so that, we think -- and when you factor on top of that the fact that we're in a COVID environment, that moving from hardware to software or moving from hardware to cloud requires either re-architecture or working in collaboration across multiple teams, which is much more difficult to effect in this environment, then we're seeing that less customers are able to do that at the moment. We think, over time, the trend will continue towards these cloud migrations, but this quarter, it was a little more muted."

As I said before, I think, 2021, we'll see for the full year our systems business will grow. And for the combination of 2021 and '22, I think performance for systems will be better than what we had anticipated in the beginning of Horizon, which was high to mid-single-digit decline. I think we'll be materially better than that. In terms of what this means longer term, frankly, it's too early to predict beyond Horizon 2. I would say, in terms of the hardware ADC space, we think, hardware ADCs per se, those are in secular decline and should decline and continue to decline over time beyond Horizon 2. And we're not seeing that in hardware security today. We'll continue to see growth in hardware security, and that represents more of a mix for us. So well, too early to make a determination in terms of what's happening beyond 2022.
And specifically when it comes to service providers, what we are seeing, Samik, is right now a lot of carriers have put in place their 5G radio -- as you know, the first smartphones with 5G have come out in the fourth quarter of 2020. A lot of the spectrum auctions have happened. And so we're now starting to see utilization of 5G from the devices into the radio, and that is coming into the carrier core networks. Now most of these carrier core networks are still 4G and we have a very strong presence in a lot of these infrastructure. And so the capacity requirements are fulfilled by 4G capacity upgrades, and that's providing tailwind to our hardware business. And I expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters, probably a little longer. Now as you go into 2022, a lot of these carriers will start to put in production their 5G core. And those are virtualized and so that opportunity will turn into a software opportunity for F5. And we have already won significant design wins for these 5G cores. And we're in the process of doing first office applications and pilots and things like that before going into production in the next 6 to 12 months. So it's a hardware expansion opportunity today, and over the next 12 months, it will move to be a software opportunity in 5G cores for F5."

Is that part of what's going on here as well? Or is it just simply that, last year, you couldn't do installs because things were so locked down that the installed base is aged and therefore it needed the upgrade? Is it -- could you give us a little bit more clarity around that?
And then the other piece of that is with Kubernetes adoption, according to a recent [ Flexera ] number, is like 2x what it was a year ago; and 96% of companies saying they're going to go with multi cloud.

So that's at least the answer to your first question.
On the second question, in terms of what we're doing with Hashi. We have a partnership with Hashi. We have several integrations in the BIG-IP space around various elements, including we make strong use of Terraform integrations to enable automation for our customers and to simplify their deployments into public clouds.

Obviously, in the last quarter, we had 70% with Shape, 35% without. And so the -- that range was right there where we thought it was going to be, and we think it's going to be a bit smoother from here. There will continue to be variability. Where we start to see a lot more clarity is when we start to lap some of the multiyear subscription agreements, and the bulk of that is going to happen in the back half of FY '22. And so we do have 4 more quarters of what I would say variability. I don't think the choppiness will be what you saw between Q1 and Q2 of this year, though we will continue to have some variability in that but starting in that lapping period. And then frankly, the denominator just gets so much bigger, so you don't have things that swing. We will start to see that as well. With the SaaS piece of the subscription continuing to grow as well, this is more -- when we take a look even beyond Horizon 2, that will become a lot more ratable in that factor and smooth things out. And so we do have some more choppiness ahead of us, but I think things really do start to smooth out when we take a look at the back half of '22 and beyond."

So I just want to make sure that I heard you correctly. You're asserting that the software weakness, relative to your original expectations, is entirely a function of a number of customers unexpectedly opting for traditional hardware systems due to urgency and addressing strong application growth and security needs.

One, of course, is that, as Frank just alluded to, it was a high comp relative to last year, but yes, the other primary factor is customers that paused or moderated on migrations to software due to operational constraints. And that is reflected in the higher hardware number and a lower software growth number, and that is very specific to BIG-IP. It's not specific -- so in the other aspects of our software portfolio around NGINX and security, we had very strong growth. In fact, NGINX grew faster than overall product revenue again, but specifically with BIG-IP, the softness, if you will, in software there is directly correlated to customers choosing, unexpectedly to us -- and it was a little bit of a surprise to us, choosing to go to a hardware form factor instead of a software form factor in a number of cases.
I would also add, Paul, that -- when you step back and you look at that, the overall demand for F5 technology is very strong. And as these customers continue to deploy BIG-IP, it increases our footprint. And when they do migrate to software, they will migrate with us. We've already proven that for the last 3 years. They will migrate on a BIG-IP software form factor. So for those customers that did that, it is a temporary delay in them moving to software, but there's absolutely there a substitutive effect of customers pausing on software, going more on hardware because they were a little caught by surprise by the surge in application demand. And given the COVID environment and the inability to re-architect and work across teams to go to software, they chose to continue and deploy hardware form factors."

Or anything above what you just said about NGINX in terms of quantifying what you're seeing from those 2 acquisitions?

We have continued to see growth in the number of customers. I would say the growth -- specifically the growth in ARR with Shape this quarter wasn't as strong as we wanted. And that's largely because we -- I was saying earlier that, for customers for which we need to do a proof of concept, in the current environment, for the same reasons that in some ways are keeping customers on hardware on the BIG-IP, effecting a proof of concept when people are not in the office and have to work across teams and collaborate and connect different systems together for proof of concepts to happen, it's operationally a little more complicated. It takes more time and it takes more motivation for customers to go and do that. And so when customers are in significant pain and they are under attack, it moves extremely quickly. When they're not, it doesn't move as fast as we want to. And that's part of what we saw this quarter with Shape, but overall, when you look at the efficacy of the solution and the satisfaction of customers and the way in which it's blocking an increasingly high number of automated attacks, we're very, very happy. And we think this thing about the difficulty of operationalizing proof of concepts and getting to a sales cycle is really a temporary thing with the COVID that will go away down the road."

Broad-based strength across the business drove 11% revenue growth in the quarter, marking our third sequential quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We delivered 34% software growth, 13% systems growth and 4% global services growth in Q3. 
F5's business is benefiting from digital acceleration and application growth as well as heightened demand for application security. Customers traditional apps are generating more revenue and more engagement than ever before. At the same time, customers also are accelerating adoption of modern application architectures like Kubernetes for new applications. 
With our expanded application security and delivery portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant modern and traditional application challenges on-prem, in the cloud and across multiple clouds. I will speak more about our business drivers and customer highlights from the quarter after Frank reviews our Q3 results and Q4 outlook. Frank?"

As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I re",973,"Thank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year ago period. 
Q3 product revenue of $310 million is up 21% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from 3% in the same period last year. Product revenue accounted for approximately 48% of total revenue, up from 44% in the year ago period. We continue to advance our transition to a more software-driven model. 
Q3 software revenue grew 34% to $129 million, representing 42% of product revenue, up from 38% in the year ago period. Today, we offer customers annual and multiyear subscriptions as well as a growing base of SaaS consumption models. Customers' preference for these flexible models is driving growth in the subscription-based portion of our revenue. In fact, since Q3 of 2018, we've driven subscription software revenue growth at a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 119%. 
In Q3 '21, Subscription-based revenue represented 78% of total software revenue, up from 73% in the year ago period. Customer adoption of our multiyear subscriptions continues to grow, providing much needed flexibility for our customers and future revenue visibility for us. These multiyear subscriptions are generally 3-year term subscriptions and can be for BIG-IP or NGINX or a combination of both. With customers increasingly looking to F5 to support both traditional and modern applications, our multiyear subscriptions are more frequently including both BIG-IP and NGINX. In fact, in Q3, NGINX was part of over half of our multiyear subscription deals. 
We see continued strong system demand based on broad-based increases in application usage, continued growth of system-based security use cases and 5G service provider use cases. In Q3, systems revenue of $180 million is up 13% compared to last year when systems were down 12%. 
Rounding out our revenue picture, we see continued strength from our global services with revenue of $342 million, up 4% compared to last year and representing 52% of total revenue. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 66% of revenue in the quarter. 
On a regional basis in Q3, Americas delivered 10% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 19% growth, representing 26% of revenue, and APAC delivered 3% growth, accounting for 18% of revenue. The strength in Q3 span customer verticals as well. Enterprise customers represented 69% of product bookings in the quarter. Service providers represented 15% and government customers represented 17%, including 4% on from U.S. Federal within the government vertical. 
I will now share our Q3 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 81.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. GAAP operating expenses were $434 million, non-GAAP operating expenses were $349 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 14.8%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 4.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is lower than anticipated as a result of an election we made with our FY '20 U.S. income tax return filed in Q3. The election related to certain research and experimentation costs for tax purposes only and have the effect of reducing our non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q3. GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million or $1.46 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $2.76 per share. 
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations in Q3. Cash and investments totaled approximately $863 million at quarter end. You will recall in Q2, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. During Q2, we retired approximately $400 million worth of shares. In Q3, we retired the remaining approximately $100 million worth of shares, reflecting roughly 449,000 shares purchased during the quarter. The average price paid per share for the full $500 million program was $199.90. DSO was 53 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. Deferred revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $1.44 billion from $1.28 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,380 employees, up approximately 20 from Q2. 
Now let me share our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support both traditional and modern application growth and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on and investment in application security. Thus far, our supply chain team has navigated industry-wide supply chain challenges well. With all signs pointing to continued challenges for at least several quarters to come, we will continue to closely monitor the situation. 
With that as a context, we are targeting Q4 fiscal 2021 revenue in the range of $660 million to $680 million, implying roughly 9% growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect FY '21 software revenue growth at or around 35% and feel very good about our software momentum as we close FY '21 and head into the back half of our Horizon 2 time frame. We expect Q4 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5%, and we estimate operating expenses of $346 million to $358 million. We also expect to achieve our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%. Our Q4 earnings target is $2.68 to $2.80 per share. We expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $62 million to $64 million. With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois.

Our very strong third quarter results demonstrate the powerful alignment of our expanded solution portfolio and our customers' most important application needs. Across the board, our customers are massively accelerating digital transform",1206,"Thank you, Frank. Our very strong third quarter results demonstrate the powerful alignment of our expanded solution portfolio and our customers' most important application needs. Across the board, our customers are massively accelerating digital transformation to keep up with current demand and forecasted growth and to meet consumers' expectations for application performance and availability. 
But it is not just keeping up with application growth that is a challenge. Customers are caught managing this robust growth across multiple infrastructures, with applications in both traditional monolithic 3-tier architectures and in modern cloud-native and container-based architectures. 
F5 is uniquely suited to solve customers' traditional and modern application challenges. Our flexible programmable BIG-IP portfolio secures and delivers traditional applications whether in a systems or software-based form factor, on-premises and in the cloud. Meanwhile, our NGINX portfolio provides high-performance application security and delivery for micro services in Kubernetes and container-based environments. And with our Shape Security portfolio, we also bring industry-leading fraud and bot protection against automated attacks. 
So let's talk about 5 sustainable customer trends resulting from accelerating digital transformation and driving robust demand across our portfolio. Number one, Enterprise customers, developers and DevOps teams are using NGINX to insert security earlier in the application life cycle. NGINX without PROTECT delivers robust application security for micro services with the flexibility and agility developers demand. In just one example, during Q3, we secured an NGINX win with an information services company, that services high security customers in financial, fintech, medical, insurance and the U.S. federal government. The customer selected NGINX Plus with App Protect for its ability to deliver Layer 7 WAF protection, reverse proxy and load balancing in a single unified solution. 
Trend #2, heightened security concerns and high-profile ransomware attacks are escalating demand for top-notch application security and further abuse mitigation.  With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, including high-profile ransomware and credential stopping attacks, we see growing demand for application security in cloud environments and rising demand for fraud and bot defense. 
In an example of the strong customer interest in our Shape solution, during the quarter, a big brand athletic shoe manufacturer selected Shape to take on a sneaker bot that was relentlessly attacking its retail site attempting to siphon off shoes for resale. Through an exhaustive proof of concept, Shape proved far more effective than a competitor at identifying and stopping the bot attack. 
Trend #3, customers are leveraging F5 for Kubernetes, containers and cloud-native architectures. Our growth in modern applications continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including API Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress controller, NGINX App Protect and software-based mode balancing. Customers' modernization efforts and the availability of NGINX Controller and enterprise-level app security with NGINX App Protect, continue to drive larger NGINX deal sizes. 
During Q3, a large health insurance provider in the United States selected NGINX to help their teams manage their modern apps. They deployed recently introduced NGINX Instance Manager to track, configure and manage their businesses NGINX open source and NGINX instances. They also deployed NGINX as an ingress controller to manage secure communications between services that are both external and internal to the Kubernetes cluster. In addition, they are using NGINX to monitor pods running in a public cloud providers managed Kubernetes service and adjust the low balancing rules based on pod availability. 
Trend #4, customers are scaling their existing hardware-based infrastructures to handle accelerating application growth, driving continued strength from BIG-IP systems. Last quarter, I spoke about the fact that some of our BIG-IP systems demand was being driven by cloud-based and SaaS providers. These global leaders are turning to  help them scale their existing application infrastructures in support of continued rapid adoption and growth of their digital products and services. In Q3, this trend continued with a global SaaS-based cloud service provider, refreshing and expanding their existing VIP infrastructure to efficiently and securely scale with rising demand. 
And finally, trend #5, customers are leveraging BIG-IP for transformation, including cloud migration and automation initiatives. The demand we are seeing for Big IP systems and software is about more than just capacity additions. Customers also are choosing BIG-IP to drive transformation. When customers move traditional applications to the cloud, they are lifting and shifting with F5, choosing not to incur the time, cost and risk of refactoring their applications. In just one in Q3, in APAC, we won a deal with a large credit issuer with a 2-year plan to exit their own data centers and migrate all nonmission-critical applications to the cloud. They chose a combination of BIG-IP and NGINX software, with a multiyear subscription consumption model to ensure flexibility throughout the process. 
In another example of F5's role in app modernization, an American multinational computer technology company is embarking on a large-scale project to build their own private cloud, including repatriating cloud workloads to save costs and drive efficiency. They selected BIG-IP hardware and software as well as NGINX to execute the project. 
While several of the trends I have just described also apply to our service provider customers, Service providers also faced unique challenges as a result of 4G to 5G migration and growing 5G traffic demands. We see GI LAN use cases gaining momentum globally as 5G devices are enabled. We are seeing 4G to 5G momentum growing for F5 in 2 ways. First, for capacity augmentation supporting 5G rollouts. Second, with virtual network function and cloud-native network function-based architectures gaining traction to replace legacy infrastructures. 
In one notable service provider win from Q3, 1 of the largest mobile providers in India turned to F5 to scale its 4G network in preparation for its 5G deployment. Before I wrap up our prepared remarks, I will comment briefly on our Volterra acquisition. The trends we are seeing across the business also bode well for the opportunity we see ahead with our Volterra platform. We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and expect to have more to share about initial use cases and launch timing in the fall. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we initiated a pilot program concentrating on specific use cases and focused on bringing F5 security to the edge. Our goal is to leverage Volterra's organic momentum and early customer interest. Among service providers,  the excitement and early interest related to Volterra continues to open doors not previously opened to F5. The combination of application growth, our expanded solutions platform and our vision for the future of adaptive apps is resonating with customers and is well aligned with industry trends. We expect demand for application security will continue to grow as application demand grows and customers scale and modernize their applications. We believe that we are exceptionally well placed with the right perspective and toolset to solve our customers' most pressing application security challenges. Our opportunity in application security is even more exciting with the ongoing integration of F5 and Volterra, which will bring enterprise-grade F5 application security to the edge in an easily deployable SaaS model. 
I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 team as well as our customers and partners. With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

Do you continue to see accelerated usage for the offerings? And if so, what does that mean economically? And what does that mean as you look into newer contracts where you might be seeing higher consumption levels than you would have anticipated previously?"
90323,1673268303,2351045,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Tim, thanks for the questions. I will take the first part and then Frank will take the second part. So let's just talk about the cloud vertical. -- generally, Tim, we continue to grow rapidly in public cloud, driven by increased software consumption of ou",554,"Tim, thanks for the questions. I will take the first part and then Frank will take the second part. So let's just talk about the cloud vertical. -- generally, Tim, we continue to grow rapidly in public cloud, driven by increased software consumption of our BIG-IP systems and also rapidly growing consumption of NGINX in public cloud environments to scale Kubernetes specifically deployment into production. And the third factor there is the security attach rate in the public cloud continues to grow. So that's just how well we're doing in public cloud. 
But if you step back, I think behind your question, I just want to go back to -- if you look back to where we were 3 years ago or 4 years ago, when I joined F5 around the perception of F5 around public cloud. I would describe the thesis at the time as the following. We were told that traditional applications on-premise would not grow and would only decline. We were told that the traditional applications that would survive would be -- would all move to the cloud and would be refactored, and therefore, F5 would not have a role in these applications. And finally, we're told that all new applications, modern applications would be both as cloud native and container-native. And F5 would not have a role in these applications. And all of that led to significant skepticism about the role of F5 and applications in the future. 
If you look at where we're at today, -- Number one, traditional apps are growing. They're revenue-generating apps and the COVID and the consumption of everything digital growing rapidly has led to traditional apps that are revenue generating, growing rapidly, and that goes on to BIG-IP. Number two, the apps that are -- not all the apps, the traditional apps are moving to the public cloud. A large number of them are not moving. But those that are moving, it's largely a lift and shift, and that benefits F5 tremendously because we are absolutely attached to these apps in the public cloud. And that's why our business in the public cloud is growing. 
And number three, as it relates to modern apps, we have a significant and growing role in modern applications with NGINX, which is an enabler and becoming an enabler of scaling these modern applications, and we have a role within BIG-IP. And so you look at the picture to date Tim, it's very different than the picture, at least that the bear thesis had 4 years ago. And if you look at where our customers are to date in, they find themselves in a situation where they have traditional apps on-premises on private clouds that are growing, and they're building these new modern apps. And they are on a 20-year march to manage the right balance between those environments, between modernizing traditional apps, building and scaling modern applications. And there is now a very powerful alignment between the portfolio of solutions that we have put together with BIG-IP, NGINX and our security portfolio, and the challenges that our customers have to resolve to grow and modernize their applications. And that's kind of manifesting in our results, both in what we're doing in the public cloud and what we're doing on-prem. Frank, do you want to address the second part?"

On software, yes, we are -- as Frank just said, our conviction in our growth in software continues to increase and continues to get stronger. -- for a couple of reasons. The first is we are indeed seeing very strong utilization of our multiyear subscription agreements, getting better visibility into expansion and true forwards. And so far, what we're seeing on expansion through forward and even our renewals, that the performance of these aspects of our software business is well ahead of our own internal target. So that is an important part of our confidence. But the second part is on our confidence is that we also have some catalysts in our software business that are starting to play out as we thought they would and perhaps even better. If you look at NGINX, the momentum of adoption of NGINX is accelerating, in part because we have a larger set of products and modules on NGINX from the investments we made 1.5 years ago. So the Controller, App Protect the security piece on NGINX moving into API Gateway, those are growing the addressable market for NGINX and some of these catalysts have been played out and will play into 2022. We see growing demand for security, including shape, and a lot of that is consumed in software. And BIG-IP is also growing in software, as I said, in public cloud and private cloud environments. So if you combine all these, you add to that, that we see a 5G opportunity that's in software in 2022 for the 5G core. Those are all catalysts that will continue to drive the growth that we expect to see software."

And the revenue growth is that once you actually sign those new term subscription agreements, there's a whole new revenue recognition component associated with that. And so the true forwards are interesting, but that becomes the new baseline in which the new deal is signed. And then in those 3-year agreements, 63% of that comes to product in the quarter that it is assigned and the balance of that is ratably deferred into the services revenue bucket over the course of that 3 years. And then the true forwards obviously have got an additive component to the product revenue in years 2 and year 3. But that lapping year is actually when you see more pickup in the product revenue on the software side."

One is security. We had a very strong quarter with Shape and in certain verticals, retail, financial services, the tech verticals, online gaming where we are -- the customers have a heightened sense of a threat environment and awareness of attack vectors. And we're able to mitigate a lot of automated attacks, but not just mitigate bot attacks but also more increasingly profile their traffic more intelligently, leveraging Shape's AI technology. which results in improved customer experience. And so it's making us really sticky in these environments and in this vertical. 
The second thing in security is we're seeing Dev SecOps teams and DevOp teams increasingly wanting to deploy security earlier in the life cycle of an application. And that points to the security capabilities of that reported on NGINX. And so we're seeing NGINX security start driving growth in our security portfolio. And since both Shape and NGINX are driving subscription-based revenues, you're seeing that increase there. 
Then the second area I would point to is just more general adoption of modern applications. One of the things that we are seeing over the last 6 months, and I think it's accelerated this quarter, is Kubernetes is going into production. A lot of customers have done development and test with these microservices, container-based applications, and they're now looking to scale these applications in a lot of cases, they're running into trouble. And NGINX has all the capabilities to help them scale their Kubernetes clusters, and it's driving an acceleration in NGINX adoption, in addition to the fact that NGINX now has multiple products, controller, API gateway, et cetera. 
So when you look at these factors, it's accelerating adoption in NGINX. One of the -- I think the most obvious manifestations of this is we have very strong momentum with NGINX. Not in just any customer, but in our top 1,000 customers, the penetration of NGINX is growing and very strong. In fact, just this quarter, if you look at -- Frank said, we had a record number of multiyear subscription agreements and NGINX was part of more than half of those multiyear subscription agreements for the first time. So it points both to the growth we're seeing with NGINX and Shape. But it also points to what I said earlier around the powerful alignment of our portfolio to the hybrid challenges that our customers face."

Last quarter, you mentioned there had been some delays in proof of concept. So just wanted to get a sense of is some of that strength, those proof of concepts resuming? Is it kind of the security breaches that we've seen that have driven some of that strength? And then maybe just a second question maybe for Frank is kind of the SaaS application or cloud customer vertical something that we should consider as being more than 10% of the business at this point? Or just any anything that would give us a sense of the size of that customer base at this point?"

So last quarter, we did mention we had some proof of concepts that were taking a long time. And that was exacerbated by the fact that customers are not in the office  and so pulling off this proof of concept and reducing the length of the sales cycle was difficult. We still have that issue. And I would say, for customers that are not under any kind of immediate significant pain and can take their time to make their decision. That is still a factor, and we hope that, that factor succeeds in the coming quarters, but it's still there. 
On the other hand, we also have a number of customers who are either under attack and need an immediate solution. And oftentimes, the solutions they have in place are not effective enough for sophisticated attacks or they have a heightened sense that they are on borrowed time and need to put in place the most effective mitigation possible. And for those sets of customers, the sales cycle is pretty rapid. And this quarter, we had more of these customers come to us. I would say there's also a maturing of the go-to-market with teams being able to identify the verticals where this is mostly the case -- and focus their efforts. So that's why the traction on Shape is accelerating. 
And then on your second part, Meta, on the cloud vertical, we don't break it down sort of on a quarterly basis in terms of quantifying exactly how much that is. But here is what I would say. When we look at where F5 is growing the fastest at the moment, if you take all companies that are either are in technology or in e-commerce or whose products are digital services. So it would include all the cloud providers and the SaaS providers. If you put all of these in a bucket, this is the area of the business for F5 that is growing the fastest at the moment. And it's intuitive why because all digital services are growing rapidly and the consumption of these services are growing rapidly. And that's driving growth for us across our entire portfolio, Shape, NGINX and BIG-IP are all benefiting from that. And I would note that it's an interesting trend because, again, if you go back 4 years ago, where you would have thought that the tech companies who are perhaps the most aggressive at moving to the cloud, adopting cloud native and container labored architectures would not be the customers that would stay on BIG-IP appliances. And where you would have expected perhaps F5 momentum to be less in the future, it's the complete opposite now where our momentum in that set of verticals is very strong."

I wanted to get into a couple of the items here. The first one is the conversion rate of NGINX to NGINX Plus, it seems pretty clear that since your acquisition of NGINX that the percentage of or the market share percent of NGINX has definitely gone up. I understand it's up in the 67% plus range now, up from like 60%. And Envoy's share has gone from over 20% to low teens. So clearly demonstrating that it's becoming the de facto standard. But can you talk about the conversion rate of NGINX and how that impacts your business? And the second piece of that same question is if you've got a 5% increase in your subscription rate in the quarter in software, I think the standard kind of rule of thumb is around 2.2x impact on the rate of growth as you convert from perpetual to software subscriptions. So if it's up 5%, does that mean it understated your growth in -- the true underlying growth rate by roughly 10% to 12%?"

It's now the most deployed web server in the world with north of 500 million websites using the technology. And so yes, an important motion with NGINX is the conversion to NGINX Plus. We have steadily gotten better about that in 2 ways. Number one is, because there is a broader set of products that can be offered either as part of NGINX or in conjunction with NGINX, the security capabilities, the API Gateway and now controllers that makes it much easier to deploy and manage these instances. There are more reasons for customers using open source to want to have access to the commercial capability."

And so we've been able to bring to them a new technology, we call it an NGINX Instant Manager that allows them to discover the open source instances that they have and oftentimes prompts them to look at that portfolio and ensure that it has the right support and oftentimes on to NGINX to have either access to better features and better version. 
So that's kind of the -- what we're seeing in terms of better conversion rates on NGINX. But I would say, we're also getting greenfield deployments with folks who did not have NGINX open source in their portfolio because as I said before, scaling these Kubernetes clusters and scaling these container-based applications is a challenge for many customers. And what they find is NGINX is a platform that consolidates a lot of functionality into 1 platform, and so they don't have to deal with 5 or 7 different vendors for different capabilities. So all of that is why we're seeing that traction."

But let me just give you a few data points. So first of all, our subscription offers really started in earnest in 2019. And so we are in the very early stages of going through these, certainly, the renewal of the multiyear subscriptions that now expired and gone to 3 years. In terms of the ones that have gone through 1 year and so we've already had a chance to the true-up, we are generally seeing expansion in consumption that is very healthy. So we're very happy about that. One of the things, Fahad, that we have worked on -- and I think now we're getting to a very good position in the first year, it used to take a long time for customers to get to full 100% utilization of what they had committed to. I think the first sort of deals we did, it took north of 20 months for customers to get to that. We have steadily brought that down to now customers in roughly 5 months or so, get to move 400% utilization of their subscription and so on beyond then they expand. So we're gaining very healthy consumption and as a result, very healthy true-ups. Renewals, it's early days. But I can tell you, we have had some renewals where we were close to 3x what we had committed to at the -- in the first multiyear subscription. Of course, not all of them are that way, but it's just to give you a range of what we see there. So those are some of the things that give us good -- better visibility into next year and good confidence in continued growth."

Amit, the -- what's driving the systems growth, I think, look, there are a few macro factors in the sense that I think that the IT spending environment right now is fairly healthy. And there is also a lot of consumption of digital services by consumers. And that, in turn, is fueling growth in applications, so growth in demand for applications. I would say that is kind of the biggest macro factor because what we see is a lot of our customers when they're refreshing their appliances, they don't go just for a refresh, they go for refresh and capacity expansion. And sometimes it's capacity expansion and transformation because we want to move in a private cloud environment. And that's driven by just more traffic and more usage of even their traditional applications. We see, as I said earlier, growth with digital and SaaS service providers. And for them, the growth comes from -- they are sometimes their services, the demand for their services, whether it's collaboration platforms or e-commerce platforms or even SaaS providers, the demand for their services are growing rapidly. And we are built into their infrastructure, and so that drives demand for our hardware, our systems into their infrastructure. And I would say, generally, -- There's also a fundamental change in stance, Amit, from -- go back to 3, 4 years ago. I would regularly hear from customers 4 years ago, look, we don't want to buy more hardware because we got to move everything to the cloud. We're going to be out of our data centers. We've got to figure out our architecture. And at the time, we said there was a pause because people were rethinking their architecture. There is not a single CIO that has told me this in the last 12 months. Every one of them, I think, a lot of people have learned from the first implementations in public cloud, sometimes the cost and time associated with refactoring applications. And generally, I think people are more comfortable that they're going to be in a hybrid environment for a very, very long time to come, if not forever. And so they're comfortable growing their on-prem presence with hardware where it makes sense and leveraging the public cloud for other initiatives. And I think that halo, that environment is very different than it was 4 years ago. And then the last factor that has an impact on our systems business and it is security. I said earlier that we had very strong growth in SaaS security with Shape, subscription security with NGINX. -- but we also have very healthy double-digit growth in hardware security. And that's because the -- all of these apps need to be secured and customers are aware of the risks, so they're moving forward with application security."

So that's where there is a -- I would say there is some level of give and get on hardware and software. But overall, the software transition for us is absolutely accretive to the business. And right now, the drivers that we are seeing in our  hardware business, we feel there are a couple of one-offs that we talked about last time around our eUSB of a certain product. But I would say the majority of the drivers we're seeing right now are pretty sustainable."

F5's business is benefiting from digital acceleration and application growth as well as heightened demand for application security. Customers' traditional apps are generating more revenue and more engagement than ever before. At the same time, customers also are accelerating adoption of modern application architectures like Kubernetes for new applications.
With our expanded application security and delivery portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant modern and traditional application challenges on-prem, in the cloud and across multiple clouds.

Please note, as I re",968,"Thank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Third quarter revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year-ago period.
Q3 product revenue of $310 million is up 21% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from 3% in the same period last year. Product revenue accounted for approximately 48% of total revenue, up from 44% in the year-ago period. We continued to advance our transition to a more software-driven model. Q3 software revenue grew 34% to $129 million, representing 42% of product revenue, up from 38% in the year-ago period.
Today, we offer customers annual and multiyear subscriptions as well as a growing base of SaaS consumption models. Customers' preference for these flexible models is driving growth in the subscription-based portion of our revenue. In fact, since Q3 of 2018, we've driven subscription software revenue growth at a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 118%. In Q3 '21, subscription-based revenue represented 78% of total software revenue, up from 73% in the year-ago period.
Customer adoption of our multiyear subscriptions continues to grow, providing much needed flexibility for our customers and future revenue visibility for us. These multiyear subscriptions are generally 3-year term subscriptions and can be for BIG-IP or NGINX or a combination of both. With customers increasingly looking to F5 to support both traditional and modern applications, our multiyear subscriptions are more frequently including both BIG-IP and NGINX. In fact, in Q3, NGINX was part of over half of our multiyear subscription deals.
We see continued strong systems demand based on broad-based increases in application usage, continued growth of system-based security use cases and 5G service provider use cases. In Q3, systems revenue of $180 million is up 13% compared to last year when systems were down 12%.
Rounding out our revenue picture, we see continued strength from our global services with revenue of $342 million, up 4% compared to last year and representing 52% of total revenue. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 66% of revenue in the quarter.
On a regional basis in Q3, Americas delivered 10% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 57% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 19% growth, representing 26% of revenue. And APAC delivered 3% growth, accounting for 18% of revenue. The strength in Q3 span customer verticals as well. Enterprise customers represented 69% of product bookings in the quarter. Service providers represented 15%. And government customers represented 17%, including 4% from U.S. federal within the government vertical.
I will now share our Q3 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 81.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. GAAP operating expenses were $434 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $349 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 14.8%. And our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 4.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14%. Our non-GAAP tax rate is lower than anticipated as a result of an election we made with our FY '20 U.S. income tax return filed in Q3. The election related to certain research and experimentation costs for tax purposes only and have the effect of reducing our non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q3. GAAP net income for the quarter was $90 million or $1.46 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $2.76 per share.
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations in Q3. Cash and investments totaled approximately $863 million at quarter end. You will recall, in Q2, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. During Q2, we retired approximately $400 million worth of shares. In Q3, we retired the remaining approximately $100 million worth of shares, reflecting roughly 449,000 shares purchased during the quarter.
The average price paid per share for the full $500 million program was $199.90. DSO was 53 days. And capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million. Deferred revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $1.44 billion from $1.28 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,380 employees, up approximately 20 from Q2.
Now let me share our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Near term, we expect customers will continue to invest to support both traditional and modern application growth and the modernization of their application infrastructures. We also anticipate continued focus on and investment in application security. Thus far, our supply chain team has navigated industry-wide supply chain challenges well. With all signs pointing to continued challenges for at least several quarters to come, we will continue to closely monitor the situation.
With that as a context, we are targeting Q4 fiscal 2021 revenue in the range of $660 million to $680 million, implying roughly 9% growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect FY '21 software revenue growth at or around 35% and feel very good about our software momentum as we close FY '21 and head into the back half of our Horizon 2 time frame.
We expect Q4 '21 gross margins of 84% to 84.5%. And we estimate operating expenses of $346 million to $358 million. We also expect to achieve our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating margin target of 31% to 32%. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19%. Our Q4 earnings target is $2.68 to $2.80 per share. We expect Q4 share-based compensation expense of approximately $62 million to $64 million.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?"

Our very strong third quarter results demonstrate the powerful alignment of our expanded solution portfolio and our customers' most important application needs. Across the board, our customers are massively accelerating digital transform",1210,"Thank you, Frank. Our very strong third quarter results demonstrate the powerful alignment of our expanded solution portfolio and our customers' most important application needs. Across the board, our customers are massively accelerating digital transformation to keep up with current demand and forecasted growth and to meet consumers' expectations for application performance and availability.
But it is not just keeping up with application growth that is a challenge. Customers are caught managing this robust growth across multiple infrastructures, with applications in both traditional monolithic 3-tier architectures and in modern cloud-native and container-based architectures. F5 is uniquely suited to solve customers' traditional and modern application challenges. Our flexible programmable BIG-IP portfolio secures and delivers traditional applications whether in a systems- or software-based form factor on-premises and in the cloud.
Meanwhile, our NGINX portfolio provides high-performance application security and delivery for micro services in Kubernetes and container-based environments. And with our Shape Security portfolio, we also bring industry-leading fraud and bot protection against automated attacks. So let's talk about 5 sustainable customer trends resulting from accelerating digital transformation and driving robust demand across our portfolio.
Number one, enterprise customers, developers and DevOps teams are using NGINX to insert security earlier in the application life cycle. NGINX with App Protect delivers robust application security for micro services with the flexibility and agility developers demand. In just one example, during Q3, we secured an NGINX win with an information services company that services high security customers in financial, fintech, medical, insurance and the U.S. federal government. The customer selected NGINX Plus with App Protect for its ability to deliver Layer 7 WAF protection, reverse proxy and load balancing in a single unified solution.
Trend #2, heightened security concerns and high-profile ransomware attacks are escalating demand for top-notch application security and fraud and abuse mitigation. With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, including high-profile ransomware and credential stuffing attacks, we see growing demand for application security in cloud environments and rising demand for fraud and bot defense.
In an example of the strong customer interest in our Shape solution, during the quarter, a big brand athletic shoe manufacturer selected Shape to take on a sneaker bot that was relentlessly attacking its retail site attempting to siphon off shoes for resale. Through an exhaustive proof-of-concept, Shape proved far more effective than a competitor at identifying and stopping the bot attack.
Trend #3, customers are leveraging F5 for Kubernetes, containers and cloud-native architectures. Our growth in modern applications continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX, Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including API gateway, Kubernetes ingress controller, NGINX App Protect and software-based load balancing. Customers' modernization efforts and the availability of NGINX Controller and enterprise-level app security with NGINX App Protect continued to drive larger NGINX deal sizes.
During Q3, a large health insurance provider in the United States selected NGINX to help their teams manage their modern apps. They deployed recently introduced NGINX Instance Manager to track, configure and manage their businesses NGINX open source and NGINX Plus instances. They also deployed NGINX as an ingress controller to manage secure communications between services that are both external and internal to the Kubernetes cluster. In addition, they are using NGINX to monitor PUDs running in a public cloud providers managed Kubernetes service and adjust the load balancing rules based on PUD availability.
Trend #4, customers are scaling their existing hardware-based infrastructures to handle accelerating application growth, driving continued strength from BIG-IP systems. Last quarter, I spoke about the fact that some of our BIG-IP systems demand was being driven by cloud-based and SaaS providers. These global leaders are turning to F5 to help them scale their existing application infrastructures in support of continued rapid adoption and growth of their digital products and services. In Q3, this trend continued with a global SaaS-based cloud service provider refreshing and expanding their existing BIG-IP infrastructure to efficiently and securely scale with rising demand.
And finally, trend #5, customers are leveraging BIG-IP for transformation, including cloud migration and automation initiatives. The demand we are seeing for BIG-IP systems and software is about more than just capacity additions. Customers also are choosing BIG-IP to drive transformation. When customers move traditional applications to the cloud, they are lifting and shifting with F5, choosing not to incur the time, cost and risk of refactoring their applications.
In just one example in Q3, in APAC, we won a deal with a large credit issuer with a 2-year plan to exit their own data centers and migrate all nonmission-critical applications to the cloud. They chose a combination of BIG-IP and NGINX software with a multiyear subscription consumption model to ensure flexibility throughout the process.
In another example of F5's role in app modernization, an American multinational computer technology company is embarking on a large-scale project to build their own private cloud, including repatriating cloud workloads to save costs and drive efficiency. They selected BIG-IP hardware and software as well as NGINX to execute the project.
While several of the trends I have just described also apply to our service provider customers, service providers also face unique challenges as a result of 4G to 5G migration and growing 5G traffic demands. We see Gi LAN use cases gaining momentum globally as 5G devices are enabled. We are seeing 4G to 5G momentum growing for F5 in 2 ways: first, for capacity augmentation supporting 5G rollouts; second, with virtual network function and cloud-native network function-based architectures gaining traction to replace legacy infrastructures.
In one notable service provider win from Q3, one of the largest mobile providers in India turned to F5 to scale its 4G network in preparation for its 5G deployment.
Before I wrap up our prepared remarks, I will comment briefly on our Volterra acquisition. The trends we are seeing across the business also bode well for the opportunity we see ahead with our Volterra platform. We continue to make good progress with our integration efforts and expect to have more to share about initial use cases and launch timing in the fall.
As I mentioned last quarter, we initiated a pilot program concentrating on specific use cases and focused on bringing F5 security to the edge. Our goal is to leverage Volterra's organic momentum and early customer interest. Among service providers,  the excitement and early interest related to Volterra continues to open doors not previously open to F5. The combination of application growth, our expanded solutions platform and our vision for the future of adaptive apps is resonating with customers and is well aligned with industry trends.
We expect demand for application security will continue to grow as application demand grows and customers scale and modernize their applications. We believe that we are exceptionally well placed with the right perspective and tool set to solve our customers' most pressing application security challenges. Our opportunity in application security is even more exciting with the ongoing integration of F5 and Volterra, which will bring enterprise-grade F5 application security to the edge in an easily deployable SaaS model.
I will wrap up today's prepared remarks by thanking the entire F5 team as well as our customers and partners. With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A."

90323,1673268303,2351074,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thanks for the questions. I will take the first part, and then Frank will take the second part. So let's just talk about the cloud vertical.

I will take the first part, and then Frank will take the second part. So let's just talk about the cloud vertical.  Generally, Tim, we continue to grow rapidly in public cloud, driven by increased software consumption of our BIG-IP systems and also rapidly growing consumption of NGINX in public cloud environments to scale Kubernetes specifically deployment into production. And the third factor there is the security attach rate in the public cloud continues to grow. So that's just how well we're doing in public cloud.
But if you step back, I think, behind your question, I just want to go back to -- if you look back to where we were 3 years ago or 4 years ago when I joined F5 around the perception of F5 around public cloud, I would describe the bear thesis at the time as the following. We were told that traditional applications on-premise would not grow and would only decline. We were told that the traditional applications that would survive would be -- would all move to the cloud and would be refactored, and therefore, F5 would not have a role in these applications. And finally, we were told that all new applications -- modern applications would be built as cloud-native and container-native and F5 would not have a role in these applications. And all of that led to significant skepticism about the role of F5 in applications in the future.
If you look at where we're at today, number one, traditional apps are growing. There are revenue-generating apps, and the COVID and the consumption of everything digital growing rapidly has led to traditional apps that are revenue-generating, growing rapidly. And that goes on to BIG-IP. Number two, the apps that are -- not all the apps -- the traditional apps are moving to the public cloud. A large number of them are not moving. But those that are moving, it's largely a lift-and-shift, and that benefits F5 tremendously because we are absolutely attached to these apps in the public cloud. And that's why our business in the public cloud is growing.
And number three, as it relates to modern apps, we have a significant and growing role in modern applications with NGINX, which is an enabler and becoming an enabler of scaling these modern applications, and we have a role within BIG-IP. And so you look at the picture to date, Tim, it's very different than the picture, at least that the bear thesis had 4 years ago. And if you look at where our customers are to date in, they find themselves in a situation where they have traditional apps on-premises, on private clouds that are growing. And they're building these new modern apps. And they are on a 20-year march to manage the right balance between those environments, between modernizing traditional apps, building and scaling modern applications.
And there is now a very powerful alignment between the portfolio of solutions that we have put together with BIG-IP, NGINX and our security portfolio and the challenges that our customers have to resolve to grow and modernize their applications. And that's kind of manifesting in our results, both in what we're doing in the public cloud and what we're doing on-prem. Frank, do you want to address the second part?"

On software, yes, we are -- as Frank just said, our conviction in our growth in software continues to increase and continues to get stronger for a couple of reasons. The first is we are indeed seeing very strong utilization of our multiyear subscription agreements, getting better visibility into expansion and true forwards. And so far, what we're seeing on expansion true forwards and even our renewals, the performance of these aspects of our software business is well ahead of our own internal target. So that is an important part of our confidence.
But the second part is -- on our confidence is that we also have some catalysts in our software business that are starting to play out as we thought they would and perhaps even better. If you look at NGINX, the momentum of adoption of NGINX is accelerating, in part because we have a larger set of products and modules on NGINX from the investments we made 1.5 years ago. So the controller, App Protect, the security piece on NGINX moving into API gateway, those are growing the addressable market for NGINX. And some of these catalysts haven't even played out and will play into 2022.
We see growing demand for security, including Shape, and a lot of that is consumed in software. And BIG-IP is also growing in software, as I said, in public cloud and private cloud environments. So if you combine all these, you add to that, that we see a 5G opportunity that's in software in 2022 for the 5G cores, those are all catalysts that will continue to drive the growth that we expect to see in software."

And so the true forwards are interesting, but that becomes the new baseline in which the new deal is signed. And then in those 3-year agreements, 63% of that comes to product in the quarter that it is assigned. And the balance of that is ratably deferred into the services revenue bucket over the course of that 3 years. And then the true forwards obviously have got an additive component to the product revenue in years 2 and years 3.

And in certain verticals,",429,"And then, Jim, on the second part and where the traction is coming from, there are 2 areas that I would point to you that's driving this increase in subscription revenue. One is security. We had a very strong quarter with Shape. And in certain verticals, retail, financial services, the tech verticals, online gaming where we are -- the customers have a heightened sense of a threat environment and awareness of attack vectors. And we're able to mitigate a lot of automated attacks, but not just mitigate bot attacks, but also more increasingly profile their traffic more intelligently, leveraging Shape's AI technology. which results in improved customer experience. And so it's making us really sticky in these environments and in these verticals.
The second thing in security is we're seeing DevSecOps teams and DevOps teams increasingly wanting to deploy security earlier in the life cycle of an application. And that points to the security capabilities of F5 that we reported on NGINX. And so we're seeing NGINX security start driving growth in our security portfolio. And since both Shape and NGINX are driving subscription-based revenues, you're seeing that increase there.
Then the second area I would point to is just more general adoption of modern applications. One of the things that we are seeing over the last 6 months, and I think it's accelerated this quarter, is Kubernetes is going into production, right? A lot of customers have done development and tests with these micro services, container-based applications, and they're now looking to scale these applications. In a lot of cases, they're running into trouble. And NGINX has all the capabilities to help them scale their Kubernetes clusters, and it's driving an acceleration in NGINX adoption in addition to the fact that NGINX now has multiple products, controller, API gateway, et cetera.
So when you look at these factors, it's accelerating adoption in NGINX. One of the -- I think the most obvious manifestations of this is we have very strong momentum with NGINX. Not in just any customer, but in our top 1,000 customers, the penetration of NGINX is growing and very strong. In fact, just this quarter, if you look at -- Frank said we had a record number of multiyear subscription agreements. And NGINX was part of more than half of those multiyear subscription agreements for the first time. So it points both to the growth we're seeing with NGINX and Shape, but it also points to what I said earlier around the powerful alignment of our portfolio to the hybrid challenges that our customers face."

Last quarter, you mentioned there had been some delays in proof of concept. So just wanted to get a sense of, is some of that strength, those proof of concepts resuming? Is it kind of the security breaches that we've seen that have driven some of that strength?
And then maybe just a second question maybe for Frank is kind of the SaaS application or cloud customer vertical something that we should consider as being more than 10% of the business at this point? Or just anything that would give us a sense of the size of that customer base at this point?"

And that was exacerbated by the fact that customers are not in the office. And so pulling off this proof of concept and reducing the length of the sales cycle was difficult. We still have that issue. And I would say, for customers that are not under any kind of immediate significant pain and can take their time to make their decision, that is still a factor. And we hope that, that factor succeeds in the coming quarters, but it's still there.
On the other hand, we also have a number of customers who are either under attack and need an immediate solution. And oftentimes, the solutions they have in place are not effective enough for sophisticated attacks. Or they have a heightened sense that they are on borrowed time and need to put in place the most effective mitigation possible. And for those sets of customers, the sales cycle is pretty rapid. And this quarter, we had more of these customers come to us. I would say there's also a maturing of the go-to-market with teams being able to identify the verticals where this is mostly the case and focus their efforts. So that's why the traction on Shape is accelerating.
And then on your second part, Meta, on the cloud vertical, we don't break it down sort of on a quarterly basis in terms of quantifying exactly how much that is. But here is what I would say. When we look at where F5 is growing the fastest at the moment, if you take all companies that are either in technology or in e-commerce or whose products are digital services. So it would include all the cloud providers and the SaaS providers. If you put all of these in a bucket, this is the area of the business for F5 that is growing the fastest at the moment. And it's intuitive why because all digital services are growing rapidly and the consumption of these services are growing rapidly.
And that's driving growth for us across our entire portfolio. Shape, NGINX and BIG-IP are all benefiting from that. And I would note that it's an interesting trend because, again, if you go back 4 years ago where you would have thought that the tech companies who are perhaps the most aggressive at moving to the cloud, adopting cloud-native and container-native architectures, would not be the customers that would stay on BIG-IP appliances. And where you would have expected perhaps F5 momentum to be less in the future, it's the complete opposite now where our momentum in that set of verticals is very strong."

I wanted to get into a couple of the items here. The first one is the conversion rate of NGINX to NGINX Plus. It seems pretty clear that since your acquisition of NGINX that the percentage of -- or the market share percent of NGINX has definitely gone up. I understand it's up in the 67% plus range now, up from like 60%. And Envoy's share has gone from over 20% to low teens, so clearly demonstrating that it's becoming the de facto standard. But can you talk about the conversion rate of NGINX to NGINX Plus and how that impacts your business?
And the second piece of that same question is if you've got a 5% increase in your subscription rate in the quarter in software, I think the standard kind of rule of thumb is around 2.2x impact on the rate of growth as you convert from perpetual to software subscriptions. So if it's up 5%, does that mean it understated your growth in -- the true underlying growth rate by roughly 10% to 12%?"

In terms of conversion of NGINX to NGINX Plus, so as you noted, Alex, NGINX is getting a lot of traction. It's now the most deployed web server in the world with north of 500 million websites using the technology. And so yes, an important motion with NGINX is the conversion to NGINX Plus. We have steadily gotten better about that in 2 ways. Number one is, because there is a broader set of products that can be offered either as part of NGINX Plus or in conjunction with NGINX Plus, the security capabilities, the API gateway and now the controllers, that makes it much easier to deploy and manage these instances. There are more reasons for customers using open source to want to have access to the commercial capability.
And then the second part is what we have found out is a number of large enterprises, customers are not aware of how many open source instances they have, how many versions they have and/or they underestimate by sometimes a factor of 10x the number of NGINX open source instances we have. And so we've been able to bring to them a new technology, we call it an NGINX Instance Manager, that allows them to discover the open source instances that they have and oftentimes prompts them to look at that portfolio and ensure that it has the right support and oftentimes move to NGINX Plus to have either access to better features and better version.
So that's kind of the -- what we're seeing in terms of better conversion rates on NGINX. But I would say, we're also getting greenfield deployments with folks who did not have NGINX open source in their portfolio because as I said before, scaling these Kubernetes clusters and scaling these container-based applications is a challenge for many customers. And what they find is NGINX is a platform that consolidates a lot of functionality into one platform. And so they don't have to deal with 5 or 7 different vendors for different capabilities. So all of that is why we're seeing that traction."

But let me just give you a few data points. So first of all, our subscription offers really started in earnest in 2019. And so we are in the very early stages of going through these, certainly, the renewal of the multiyear subscriptions that have expired and gone to 3 years. In terms of the ones that have gone through 1 year and so we've already had a chance to the true-up, we are generally seeing expansion in consumption that is very healthy. So we're very happy about that.
One of the things, Fahad, that we have worked on, and I think now we're getting to a very good position, is in the first year, it used to take a long time for customers to get to full 100% utilization of what they had committed to. I think the first sort of deals we did, it took north of 20 months for customers to get to that. We have steadily brought that down to now customers, in roughly 5 months or so, get to 400% utilization of their subscription. And so beyond then, they expand.
So we're gaining very healthy consumption and, as a result, very healthy true-ups. Renewals, it's early days, but I can tell you, we have had some renewals where we were close to 3x what they had committed to at the -- in the first multiyear subscription. Of course, not all of them are that way, but it's just to give you a range of what we see there. So those are some of the things that give us good -- better visibility into next year and good confidence in continued growth."

Amit, the -- what's driving the systems growth -- I think, look, there are a few macro factors in the sense that I think that the IT spending environment right now is fairly healthy. And there is also a lot of consumption of digital services by consu",469,"Yes. Amit, the -- what's driving the systems growth -- I think, look, there are a few macro factors in the sense that I think that the IT spending environment right now is fairly healthy. And there is also a lot of consumption of digital services by consumers. And that, in turn, is fueling growth in applications, so growth in demand for applications. I would say that is kind of the biggest macro factor. Because what we see is a lot of our customers when they're refreshing their appliances, they don't go just for a refresh, they go for refresh and capacity expansion.
And sometimes this capacity expansion and transformation, because we want to move in a private cloud environment, and that's driven by just more traffic and more usage of even their traditional applications. We see, as I said earlier, growth with digital and SaaS service providers. And for them, the growth comes from -- their -- sometimes their services, the demand for their services, whether it's collaboration platforms or e-commerce platforms or even SaaS providers, the demand for their services are growing rapidly. And we are built into their infrastructure. And so that drives demand for our hardware, our systems into their infrastructure.
And I would say, generally, there's also a fundamental change in stance, Amit, from -- go back to 3, 4 years ago. I would regularly hear from customers 4 years ago, look, we don't want to buy more hardware because we've got to move everything to the cloud. We're going to be out of our data centers. We've got to figure out our architecture. And at the time, we said there was a pause because people were rethinking their architecture. There is not a single CIO that has told me this in the last 12 months. Every one of them -- I think a lot of people have learned from the first implementations in public cloud, sometimes the cost and time associated with refactoring applications.
And generally, I think people are more comfortable that they're going to be in a hybrid environment for a very, very long time to come, if not forever. And so they're comfortable growing their on-prem presence with hardware where it makes sense and leveraging the public cloud for other initiatives. And I think that halo, that environment is very different than it was 4 years ago.
And then the last factor that has an impact on our systems business and it is security. I said earlier that we had very strong growth in SaaS security with Shape, subscription security with NGINX. But we also have very healthy double-digit growth in hardware security. And that's because the -- all of these apps need to be secured. And customers are aware of the risks, so they're moving forward with application security."

I would separate, though -- when you look at our software business, you've got NGINX and Shape. And I don't think there's any relationship between the growth of that part of our software portfolio and the growth in hardware. When you look at BIG-IP per se, this is where we have seen and, in fact, we continue to see some customers that we would have expected to have moved to a software form factor right now that are delaying or reconsidering in part because of COVID, in part because of the immediate demand that they see on their applications.
So that's where there is a -- I would say there is some level of give-and-get on hardware and software. But overall, the software transition for us is absolutely accretive to the business. And right now, the drivers that we are seeing in our  hardware business, we feel there are a couple of one-offs that we talked about last time around our EoSD of a certain product. But I would say the majority of the drivers we're seeing right now are pretty sustainable."

I think there is a little bit of a catch-up demand from, in our case, FY '19 and FY '20, where people were kind of very cautious in the early parts of the pandemic. And I think those 2 are somewhat cyclical.
I think the aspects that are more durable are things like what we're seeing in the tech sector, whether I think the demand for digital services is just going to continue to grow, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. And I think generally, demand for traditional applications in hybrid infrastructure is also going to continue to be solid. And I think that's a durable piece.
And then the last element that's durable is security. I said we have healthy double-digit growth in hardware security. And I think demand for security is going to continue for the foreseeable future. So both elements are part of what we're seeing right now. And I think we'll -- time will tell, I think, in a couple more quarters to see how much of each is contributing."

I'll review our Q4 results before briefly recapping our fiscal year results. As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $682 million is up 11% yea",1531,"Thank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review our Q4 results before briefly recapping our fiscal year results. As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $682 million is up 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures for the year ago period. 
Q4 product revenue of $340 million is up 21% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from 6% in the same period last year. Q4's software revenue grew 35% to $152 million, representing 45% of product revenue, up from 40% in the year ago period. Systems revenue of $188 million is up 12% compared to Q4 last year when systems were down 8%. Rounding out the revenue picture, we continue to see strength from our global services at $342 million in Q4, up 2% compared to last year and representing 50% of revenue. 
Taking a closer look at our software revenue, customers' preference for subscription-based consumption models is evident. In Q4 '21, subscription-based revenue represented 80% of total software revenue, up from 76% in the year ago period. Subscription-based revenue includes our ratably recognized as-a-service offerings and our solutions sold as term-based licenses. Within subscriptions, customer demand is driving substantial volume and value growth from our multiyear subscriptions. The deal volume of our multiyear subscriptions more than doubled year-over-year and is protein 500 in total. This consumption model offers flexibility for the customer and through the annual true forward and normal renewal cycles offers us visibility to customers' utilization and consumption patterns. 
In addition, we ended the year with more than 600 SaaS and managed service customers, reflecting growth of 50% year-over-year. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 67% of revenue in the quarter. 
On a regional basis in Q4, Americas delivered 11% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 59% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 11% growth, representing 24% of revenue and APAC delivered 9% growth, accounting for 17% of revenue. 
The strength in Q4 span customer verticals as well. Enterprise customers represented 69% of product bookings in the quarter Service providers represented 13% and government customers represented 18%, including 8% from U.S. Federal. 
I will now share our Q4 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 81.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.7%. GAAP operating expenses were $427 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $350 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 18.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $111 million or $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $185 million or $3.01 per share. 
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $197 million in cash flow from operations in Q4. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.04 billion at quarter end. DSO was 45 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $1.489 billion, up from $1.273 billion. The growth in total deferred was largely driven by subscription and SaaS bookings growth and, to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance. 
Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,460 employees, up approximately 80 from Q3. This does not include approximately 90 employees added with the threat stack acquisition, which closed in our fiscal first quarter of 2022. 
I will now briefly recap our full year 2021 results. For the year, revenue grew 10% to $2.6 billion. Product revenue of $1.25 billion grew 21% from the prior year and accounted for 48% of total revenue, up from 44% in the year ago period. Within product revenue, software grew 37% to $500 million, a beat on our outlook for at or about 35% growth for the year. Systems revenue in FY '21 grew 12% to $748 million. Global Services grew 2% to $1.36 billion, representing 52% of total revenue. 
Looking more closely at our software revenue. Since fiscal 2018, we've grown our software revenue at a 49% compounded annual growth rate and our software subscription revenue at 115% compounded annual growth rate. GAAP gross margin in FY '21 was 81.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. Our GAAP operating margin in FY '21 was 15.1% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 14.4%. 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 17.7%. GAAP net income for FY '21 was $331 million or $5.34 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $671 million or $10.81 per share. Application security is a big and growing reason customers turn to F5. Our application security offerings, including DDoS protection, advanced vulnerability defense for web application firewall and bought fraud and abuse protections are increasingly recognized as industry-leading. As a result, we estimate our stand-alone security product revenue grew 26% in FY '21 to approximately $350 million, reflecting a 38% compounded annual growth rate since FY '18, including bundled security offerings, and an estimate for our services revenue associated with security, we estimate the total application security portion of our business grew to more than $900 million in FY '21, representing approximately 35% of total revenue. 
Supply chain challenges have been well acknowledged across the industry over the last year. Our supply chain team continues to do an impressive job managing global supply chain constraints and working through our supplier ecosystem to manage through challenging conditions. At this point, like many others, we are working with extended lead times. In part as a result of supply chain constraints, we ended FY '21 with approximately $125 million in backlog, the vast majority of which is system-based. 
Now let me share our guidance for our first quarter as well as some color on our view for FY '22. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Let me start with sharing our expectations for the first quarter of 2022. We are targeting Q1 revenue in the range of $665 million to $685 million, implying roughly 8% growth at the midpoint. We expect Q1 '22 gross margins of approximately 84%. We estimate operating expenses of $342 million to $354 million. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.71 to $2.83 per share with a share count of approximately $62 million. We expect Q1 share-based compensation expense of approximately $64 million to $66 million. 
Now let me share some operating expectations for our 2022 fiscal year. For the year, we expect revenue growth of 8% to 9%. We expect software growth of between 35% and 40%. We expect the range of software variability we will see quarter-to-quarter will narrow relative to what we have experienced in the past. This is due in part to what we expect will be a higher contribution from ratable revenue over time and also in part due to increased scale of our software business overall. We expect systems revenue growth will be flat to slightly up for the year. And we continue to expect low single-digit global services revenue growth. I'd note that all of these revenue expectations are at or above our most recent Horizon 2 outlook provided in January with the Volterra acquisition announcement. We anticipate continued pressures related to our global supply chain in the next several quarters. We expect these pressures will result in some increased costs related to the expedite fees and sourcing of long lead time components. In light of this dynamic, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 83.5% to 84% for the year, and we will continue to closely monitor the situation as we have throughout the past year. 
We continue to target operating on the Rule of 40 basis, where the combination of our revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins totaled $40 million. The combination of our strong FY '21 revenue growth and our continued operating discipline enabled us to achieve the Rule of 40 in 4 out of 4 quarters in FY '21, ahead of our initial Horizon 2 target. We continue to target achieving the Rule of 40 in FY '22. Given our anticipated revenue growth and the ongoing benefits from the cost reduction initiatives that we discussed at our analyst and investor meeting last year, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 32% to 33% for FY '22. We expect our typical operating margin seasonality, which translates to operating margins stepping down in Q2 and improving in the back half of the year. We anticipate our full fiscal year effective tax rate will be at or around 21% with some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. This estimate does not account for any potential future federal tax changes. We expect fiscal 2022 stock-based compensation expense in the range of $250 million to $270 million and capital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $60 million. 
Finally, for the year, we expect share count to remain at approximately 62 million shares, inclusive of the expected share repurchase of $500 million during FY '22 as we previously discussed. 
With that, I will turn the call back to Francois. Francois?"
90323,1684607451,2413166,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Our very strong fourth quarter results are the perfect cap to our robust out performance in FY '21. In the last 18 months, our reliance on application, both as businesses and as consumers have escalated sharply and likely forever changed",1638,"Thank you, Frank. Our very strong fourth quarter results are the perfect cap to our robust out performance in FY '21. In the last 18 months, our reliance on application, both as businesses and as consumers have escalated sharply and likely forever changed. Our customers are massively accelerating digital transformation to keep up with current demand and forecasted growth. They are doing this while also working to consistently meet consumers' high expectations for application performance and availability and while also ensuring their applications and the consumers' data are secure. In my conversation with investors, I am often asked what is potentially misunderstood about F5. 
Let me address the key points here. First, traditional on-premise applications continue to grow, counter to the prevailing expectations from 2 to 3 years ago. In fact, traditional apps are generating more traffic and more revenue than ever because every aspect of life and business relies on applications. For F5, this means big IP demand will continue to grow in both software and systems form factors. Second, contrary to early cloud height, the vast majority of traditional applications are not being refactored. They are either remaining on-premise or they are moving to the cloud with a lift and shift motion. In other words, F5 run applications are remaining attached to F5. As a result, big IP is growing both on-premise and in public clouds. Third, modern, container-based applications continue to grow at a rapid pace and not only for new applications. 
Customers are bolting new modern components on to traditional applications to improve the user experience. In many cases, cloud-native application security and delivery simply are not robust enough to meet the applications needs. For F5, this means accelerating NGINX demand, enabling app security and scale for modern applications, often as a complement to big IP. 
And finally, given the volume of business and data that is now flowing through application and the increasingly distributed nature of applications, application security has taken on new significance. Where in the past, network and infrastructure security was a focus for customers and vendors alike. We expect application security will be one of the hottest areas of investment over the next decade. F5 is one of the few players, 100% focused on application security, and we protect not just access to applications, but also how they are used. As a result, we expect our own and reputation as a leading application security provider will accelerate. 
To sum up these points, F5 is differentiated and well positioned to benefit from significant emerging secular trends. There are some companies focused on applications. There also are some focused on application security. F5 is the only one that is at the epicenter of these 2 secular forces with a focus expertise and the technology assets to secure and deliver any application anywhere. 
Let's ground our opportunity in real customer trends and use cases. Last quarter, I talked about 5 sustainable customer trends we expected to drive demand across our portfolio. Let's revisit those trends with some customer examples from Q4. Number one, enterprise customers, developers and DevOps teams are using NGINX to insert security earlier in the application life cycle. NGINX without protect delivers robust application security for micro services with the flexibility and agility developers demand. In one example, during Q4, we secured an NGINX win with a global insurance group. They are migrating their consumer-facing insurance services into a public cloud. 
For risk mitigation and security reasons, they required a scalable and container-friendly solution. They also needed enterprise-grade security capable of protecting their strategic high-value apps and guaranteeing risk management compliance, and they wanted all of this within a lightweight footprint that could drive automation, saving time and money, NGINX with APPROTECT was the natural choice. Trend number two, heightened security concerns and high-profile ransom ware attacks are escalating demand for top-notch application security and fraud and abuse mitigation. With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, including high-profile ransom ware and financial stuffing attacks, we see growing demand for application security in plant environment and rising demand for fraud and bot defense. 
During Q4, a North American electric utility experienced a credential stuffing attack resulting in substantial infrastructure failure. More than 6 million customers had to reset their account passwords. Based on their experience as a big IP customer, the utility turned to F5 for health. Shape was emergency onboarded identified high volumes of automated traffic and deployed highly effective mitigation measures to stop the attack. Trend number three, customers are leveraging F5 for Kubernetes, containers and cloud-native architectures. Our growth in modern application continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including managing APIs optimizing Kubernetes traffic management and load balancing cloud-native and hybrid cloud applications with customers modern applications experiencing significant and constant swings in user demand they need infrastructure that fails up automatically to meet user demands or down to save cloud costs. 
During Q4, the Canadian online investment manager selected NGINX to move their Kubernetes-based applications into production at scale. Initially, they attempted to use a competitive solution but it lacks performance in the non integrate well with their HashiCorp console or with AWS auto scaling. 
NGINX Plus delivered low latency and high uptime to improve user experience and integrated seamlessly with AWS autoscaling to spin down half of their instances during off-peak traffic demand. Trend #4, customers are scaling their existing hardware-based infrastructures to handle accelerating application growth, driving continued strength from BIG-IP systems. We are finding that customers are often looking to scale both their existing infrastructure and their modern apps infrastructure simultaneously. This is particularly true amongst tech and SaaS provider customers who continue to experience rapid adoption and growth of their digital products and services. 
In the latest of a growing list of examples, during Q4, a high-growth SaaS provider selected F5 to help them scale both the traditional apps on BIG-IP and their modern public cloud apps with NGINX. This deal was made sweeter by the fact that NGINX displaced a competitor that wasn't performing as promised. 
Finally, trend #5. Customers are leveraging BIG-IP for transformation, including cloud migration and automation initiatives. The demand we are seeing for BIG-IP systems and software is about more than just capacity additions. Customers also are choosing big IP to drive transformation, often combining it with NGINX. F5 is particularly well suited for enterprises that operate both modern and traditional applications, which most do. NGINX integrations with BIG-IP provide differentiation over competitor and cloud-native offerings and we will extend this with integrations into Volterra at the edge. 
During Q4, the BIG-IP and NGINX combination was selected by one of the largest online betting companies in Asia Pacific. A customer who processes more than 1 billion annual transactions needed hybrid on-premises data security as well as the ability to support modern app development and new engaging multimedia capabilities. They selected BIG-IP and NGINX as the foundation for their digital transformation. 
Let me touch briefly on service providers and our Volterra integration progress before concluding our prepared remarks. We had a good year with service providers in FY '21. While it's true that several of the trends I have just described also apply to our service provider customers, they also faced unique challenges as a result of 4G to 5G migration and growing 5G traffic demands. Thus far, our service provider demand has come largely from 4G core network upgrades as they expand hardware capacity and upgrade existing infrastructures to handle 5G traffic. We expect software use cases will begin to emerge as carriers virtualize their 5G core. 
Looking forward, our Volterra platform is generating significant interest from service providers. They view it as a way to insert their capabilities at the edge, thus creating 5G in a box offerings. That offer us a good transition to discussing progress on the integration of Volterra. Volterra is a universal edge platform, which will enable us to insert critical application services at the edge and allow our customers to consume these services in a SaaS format. Our initial priority is on security offerings. We have one of the best, if not the best, application security software stacks in the industry, including our web application firewall, our DDoS protection, API security and bot capabilities. We are taking that entire security stack and integrating it natively into the Volterra platform. Our first priority is a SaaS security offering that will address the shift towards modern web apps and APIs and we are on track to deliver within our committed 12- to 18-month integration window. Our recent acquisition of Threat Stack, a leader in cloud security and workload protection is designed to accelerate our SaaS security offerings with cloud endpoint telemetry and analytics for better detection and response. Threat Stack also augments our telemetry and virtual security and technology expertise and I want to take this opportunity to once again welcome the entire Threat Stack team to F5. 
In closing, we are more confident than ever in our vision and in our ability to continue to execute. The combination of application growth, our expanded solutions platform, our continuously evolving go-to-market strategy and our vision for the future of adaptive applications is resonating with customers and puts us at the epicenter of several emerging strong secular trends. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire F5 team for their steadfast focus and execution. As a team, we have accomplished more faster than anyone, even us thought we could. We've got more work ahead, but I am more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our goals. My thanks to our customers and partners for being on our journey with us and providing guidance and support along the way.

And then on the second point, just on the ability of the kind of gross margin impact you're seeing from cost. Is that mostly expediting. Is there any ability to pass that on?

Let me start on shape. Yes, a couple of quarters ago, we did mention we were seeing and won't get any time to close on these proof of concept largely because customers were not in the office and getting those done, we're taking a little longer. We have seen that abate over the last few months. And so we're seeing a pickup in traction and momentum there. And then specifically, I think in the e-commerce area, so we've got a number of customers whose applications are revenue generating, and they're constantly under these either account takeover attacks or bought tax that are causing disruption to their business. And so they want to move pretty quickly on getting things done, either as an insurance against future attacks or oftentimes, when they're under attack, of course, things go very, very quickly because their business is disrupted. So generally, we are happy with the quarter we just had with the shape. 
And in general, Meta, I would say the other thing we're seeing with customers is at a number of customers have been reevaluating their security posture as a result of some of the high-profile breaches that have been well publicized. And that has resulted overall in a very strong year for the fiscal year for us in security, but especially in the second half where customers have reinvigorated the motion of attaching security to BIG-IP. And we've also seen the momentum with shape and security. So that's overall the picture we're seeing in security. As it relates to your second question on gross margins, yes, our gross margins have been impacted by the challenges on the supply chain, whether it's some increase in prices on some components or some expedite fees to get our side when we need it. So the supply chain generally has been quite a challenging environment. And generally, we have managed that pretty well with our team, but it continues to be a challenging environment. And so we're going to continue to monitor the developments there and and we'll adjust over time as we need to."

We finished the year at 37%. but inside the year, there was strong variability, especially in the first half. And what we -- so we still expect to land between 35% to 40%. We do expect we will see less variability this year than we saw last year. in part because we have better visibility into a portion of our revenues that are coming from a business that is already contracted and also in part because of the scale of the business.

Some of it actually, we think is -- I wouldn't call it an anomaly, but we think some of it are transient factors that will go away. We think there was some element of a catch-up demand because demand was quite depressed 12 months ago. And there also may have been a couple of specific factors earlier in the year when we announced our end of software development that some customers jumped on that to refresh quickly. So we think some of these are one-off factors, but we also think that there are macro factors that are not transient, and that will proceed. And that's specifically the traffic and usage of traditional application is growing and it's going to continue to grow because these applications are generating more revenue, more customer loyalty and more large companies depend on these applications. 
And so when you look at 2021, there's some element that's one-off, there's elements that are not. When we look at that and project to the future, all of that tells us that the demand for BIG-IP as a franchise. So both hardware and software, if you take that combination, we feel today that the demand for BIG-IP in the future, even beyond 2022 will be better than what we would have said a year ago. 
Now what will be the mix between BIG-IP hardware and software in the future is still tough to predict because a lot of it depends on individual customer situations and when they're ready to migrate to software and when they're not. But if you take the combination of those 2 things, we certainly feel better about it today than we did 12 months ago, and that's because of factors that are not an anomaly. Those are factors that are kind of secular forces that will continue on."

And then second, thanks for the update on overall security. At the Analyst Day, you also gave us a look into the cloud vertical. So I'm just wondering if you could kind of update us on how that cloud vertical performed in fiscal '21 and what you're expecting moving forward there?"

But we saw a fairly healthy step-up between that initial term and the second term. And so that's all very quite positive. 
And then in terms of the true forward expansions within the terms for those customers. That's a growing customer base. Again, that was a bit higher than where we were last quarter. I can't say that that's going to absolutely continue, but we're very, very optimistic by the progress that we've seen in the data that we've gotten so far to date."

So in that number,",456,"So Tim, on your second question, just to clarify, when you said the cloud vertical. So when we talked about our cloud revenue at Analyst Day, we're talking about F5 solutions being deployed in public cloud environment very specifically. So in that number, which at the time, we said it was greater than $100 million. We do not include a lot of the business we do with hyperscaler SaaS providers at providers, where we are in their infrastructure and helping them deliver applications. So that -- so -- but with that definition clarified, our cloud number continues to grow. As you know, it's 100% software, of course. And it has grown faster than our overall software growth rate continued this year. And where we are seeing a lot of traction in the last 12 months is in what we call private offers on marketplaces. And so essentially, that is consumed as a utility by large enterprises. And it is increasingly the case that large enterprises have spent commitments with the major public cloud providers. And we've done all the integrations, both technical and commercial, that allow these enterprises to retire their spend commitment on F5. And we've seen an acceleration of that trend. And it's yet another way that we are removing friction in the consumption of F5 software in public cloud, and we're getting the benefit of that in terms of growth. The other big area of growth, timing public cloud is NGINX. A number of the NGINX deployments continue to happen in public cloud and cloud-native environments. And we are seeing an NGINX I think as I've shared before, when you step back and you look at the success of the BIG-IP franchise over the last 20 years, one of the things that we did well was that BIG-IP consolidated a lot of functionality initially low balancing, but then security, authentication, encryption on a single platform, and that made things operationally much simpler for our customers and that created the BIG-IP franchise. And we're essentially seeing the emergence of the same playbook with NGINX both on-prem and in public cloud environments, the 4 modern applications. And the type of application security and delivery that we do in modern apps is not necessarily exactly the same. There are things like ingress controllers, people feel that they have to secure -- authenticate their APIs. So we offer API gateways. They need to encrypt their traffic inside their service match, so we offer that as well. And of course, we offer security and protection. But when you take that suite of application security and delivery services, we're seeing that playbook grow for NGINX, and that's also one of the factors of growth in public cloud for F5."

Of course, there is quite a bit of time between now and in 2025. But here's, I think, the way we look at it.

Of course, there is quite a bit of time between now and in 2025. But here's, I think, the way we look at it. So I think when you look back at where we were 12 months ago at our Analyst Day, and we talked about a long-term target of getting to double-digit revenue growth. We didn't put a year on it, but we felt that, that we wanted to get to that long-term target. 
By looking back at where we're at today, I would say the things that we thought will help us out around growth in SaaS and security growth with NGINX and our new value proposition. That's going roughly per plan for the view that we had at the time. what is going better is overall the demand for BIG-IP. And I think in that going better, there's an element of it that is that is more of a secular trend that will go on for several years. And so that's kind of the mix. 
Now if you step back from it, Samik, what we are seeing is 3 or 4 years ago, there was a view of the world that say, all apps are going to go to a public cloud. And that's kind of the future of the world. I'm sure you're seeing from a number of industry data points, including cloud providers actually saying that themselves that. The reality for large enterprises is for the last many decades, they have always been told that they just have to get to the next thing and everything is going to go to the next thing. And the practical reality of that is it hasn't happened, right? And there's a realization now that it's not about the next thing. It's about managing a heterogeneous environment and being able to run applications in on-prem environment in public cloud, increasingly at the edge in colocation environment. And at prices are very comfortable that, that's going to be the reality and the conversation has shifted not to how do I get to a single public cloud in the future, but more of an architectural conversation around, okay, I'm going to be in all these places. What is the simplest way because that creates complexity for me? What is the simplest way in which I can manage and run my applications across this hybrid environment. And those conversations, like F5 have spent like 5 years positioning ourselves for this environment. and we're having a lot of joy because we're able to support customers on-prem, in public clouds, in private clouds, in modern applications, increasingly at the edge. And we feel that, that's going to be a secular trend that's going to last for several years. So that's what we're positioning for Samik, and that's what -- why generally, we feel good about the next 3 years."

And so when we acquired Volterra, we felt that we needed to really focus on the completing integrations of Shape and NGINX and Volterra in that period, and we're well on our way of doing that. And I think that's going to we continue to be focused on those organic integrations and extensions and now Threat Stack brings a very interesting new capability to F5 in giving us visibility into these cloud environments and being able to observe the environment in which cloud workloads are running which complements very nicely the rest of our security portfolio, which as you can see, is 100% focused on application security and essentially building the broadest portfolio and application security stack. So that's been the focus in terms of potential future M&A. 
Over time, we'll continue to evaluate building versus buying. You've heard me say before, we're very disciplined about that. We start always with our preferences to build. But if for time-to-market reasons or there's an opportunity to do something that accelerates our vision, then we look at that. The focus of that will continue to be on fulfilling this vision for adaptive applications, which is essentially about the world of running applications for large enterprises, is still very manual front with complexity and front with fragility. And we have an architectural vision that we think is going to bring way more automation to this world. way better uptime for applications with stronger security and with better intelligence and insights about the performance of applications. And that's what we will focus on bringing that vision to our customers, bringing it to reality. And every single quarter, organically or inorganically down the road, we are making that vision more and more of a reality. And it's, I think, elevating F5 to more of a strategic a partner for our customers' digital transformation rather than a point solution player."

So we are -- for the most part, I would say we don't compete very directly with Cloudflare. That's not a significant overlap today. I think that will grow more as we introduce our Volterra platform to wide distribution post the integration because we will play way more at the edge with SaaS security offerings for a wide range of customers. We do Akamai specifically with Shape Security in the protecting customers against at attacks. And I think their approach is to bundle security with their CDN, especially for customers that are using their CDN. We have an approach that's more about best-in-class efficacy for enterprise customers that place a significant premium on having world-class efficacy against bond attacks, and we do very well with that customer segment. So we're starting to see more and more competition with these players. And I think out of disrupter with our universal edge platform, that competition is going to grow. But we feel very good about the attributes of Volterra.

In terms of the specific operating margin expansion, as you recall, we had a 32% to 34% range that we tightened up to 32% to 33%, largely driven by the gross margin hits that we have been seeing and what we expect to see because of some of those supply chain constraints through FY '22. And so we are increasing, obviously, the efficiencies that we're seeing in the business by lifting that up from where we ended at that 31.6%. So at the midpoint, almost 100 basis points increase, but we're doing that on the backs of having higher cost on the gross margin side.

But frankly, if we don't hit that target, largely because our hardware has totally over performed, we will be very happy with that. And not just happy because of what's going on in the short term, but happy because what it translates to is, a, that the BIG-IP franchise overall is doing better than we thought; and b, all these customers that are extending their time purchasing hardware and not making a transition to software, it creates a bigger installed base for us to migrate to software down the road. So it actually is very good news over time even for our software business because we have a much bigger real estate. So we're -- what we're focused on, of course, is if you look at it in absolute dollars, we will absolutely hit the target that we gave for software revenue for that 5 in our Horizon 2 in both absolute dollars translate to 50% mix, that's fine. If they don't, because hardware has over performed, we'll be happy with that."

As Francois just outlined, our team delivered another very strong quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $682 million is up 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. Please note, as I review our revenue mix, I will be referring to non-GAAP revenue measures with the year ago period.
Q4 product revenue of $340 million is up 21% year-over-year, representing a significant acceleration from 6% in the same period last year. Q4's software revenue grew 35% to $152 million, representing 45% of product revenue, up from 40% in the year ago period. Systems revenue of $188 million is up 12% compared to Q4 last year when systems were down 8%. Rounding out the revenue picture, we continue to see strength from our global services at $342 million in Q4, up 2% compared to last year and representing 50% of revenue.
Taking a closer look at our software revenue, customers' preference for subscription-based consumption models is evident. In Q4 '21, subscription-based revenue represented 80% of total software revenue, up from 76% in the year ago period. Subscription-based revenue includes our ratably recognized as-a-service offerings and our solutions sold as term-based licenses. 
Within subscriptions, customer demand is driving substantial volume and value growth from our multiyear subscriptions. The deal volume of our multiyear subscriptions more than doubled year-over-year and is protein 500 in total. This consumption model offers flexibility for the customer and through the annual true forward and normal renewal cycles offers us visibility to customers' utilization and consumption patterns.
In addition, we ended the year with more than 600 SaaS and managed service customers, reflecting growth of 50% year-over-year. Revenue from recurring sources, which includes term subscriptions as a service and utility-based revenue as well as the maintenance portion of our services revenue totaled 67% of revenue in the quarter.
On a regional basis in Q4, Americas delivered 11% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 59% of total revenue. EMEA delivered 11% growth, representing 24% of revenue and APAC delivered 9% growth, accounting for 17% of revenue.
The strength in Q4 span customer verticals as well. Enterprise customers represented 69% of product bookings in the quarter, service providers represented 13% and government customers represented 18%, including 8% from U.S. Federal.
I will now share our Q4 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 81.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.7%. GAAP operating expenses were $427 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $350 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 18.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 32.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15%. GAAP net income for the quarter was $111 million or $1.80 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $185 million or $3.01 per share.
I will now turn to the balance sheet. We generated $197 million in cash flow from operations in Q4. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.04 billion at quarter end. DSO was 45 days, and capital expenditures for the quarter were $7 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $1.489 billion, up from $1.273 billion. The growth in total deferred was largely driven by subscription and SaaS bookings growth and, to a lesser extent, deferred service maintenance.
Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately 6,460 employees, up approximately 80 from Q3. This does not include approximately 90 employees added with the Threat Stack acquisition, which closed in our fiscal first quarter of 2022.
I will now briefly recap our full year 2021 results. For the year, revenue grew 10% to $2.6 billion. Product revenue of $1.25 billion grew 21% from the prior year and accounted for 48% of total revenue, up from 44% in the year ago period. Within product revenue, software grew 37% to $500 million, a beat on our outlook for at or about 35% growth for the year. Systems revenue in FY '21 grew 12% to $748 million. Global services grew 2% to $1.36 billion, representing 52% of total revenue.
Looking more closely at our software revenue. Since fiscal 2018, we've grown our software revenue at a 49% compounded annual growth rate and our software subscription revenue at 115% compounded annual growth rate. GAAP gross margin in FY '21 was 81.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. Our GAAP operating margin in FY '21 was 15.1% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 14.4%.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 17.7%. GAAP net income for FY '21 was $331 million or $5.34 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $671 million or $10.81 per share. Application security is a big and growing reason customers turn to F5. Our application security offerings, including DDoS protection, advanced vulnerability defense for web application firewall and bot fraud and abuse protections are increasingly recognized as industry-leading. As a result, we estimate our stand-alone security product revenue grew 26% in FY '21 to approximately $350 million, reflecting a 38% compounded annual growth rate since FY '18, including bundled security offerings, and an estimate for our services revenue associated with security, we estimated the total application security portion of our business grew to more than $900 million in FY '21, representing approximately 35% of total revenue.
Supply chain challenges have been well acknowledged across the industry over the last year. Our supply chain team continues to do an impressive job managing global supply chain constraints and working through our supplier ecosystem to manage through challenging conditions. At this point, like many others, we are working with extended lead times. In part as a result of supply chain constraints, we ended FY '21 with approximately $125 million in backlog, the vast majority of which is system-based.
Now let me share our guidance for our first quarter as well as some color on our view for FY '22. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP metrics. Let me start with sharing our expectations for the first quarter of 2022. We are targeting Q1 revenue in the range of $665 million to $685 million, implying roughly 8% growth at the midpoint. We expect Q1 '22 gross margins of approximately 84%. We estimate operating expenses of $342 million to $354 million. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.71 to $2.83 per share with a share count of approximately 62 million. We expect Q1 share-based compensation expense of approximately $64 million to $66 million.
Now let me share some operating expectations for our 2022 fiscal year. For the year, we expect revenue growth of 8% to 9%. We expect software growth of between 35% and 40%. We expect the range of software variability we will see quarter-to-quarter will narrow relative to what we have experienced in the past. This is due in part to what we expect will be a higher contribution from ratable revenue over time and also in part due to increased scale of our software business overall. 
We expect systems revenue growth will be flat to slightly up for the year. And we continue to expect low single-digit global services revenue growth. I'd note that all of these revenue expectations are at or above our most recent Horizon 2 outlook provided in January with the Volterra acquisition announcement. 
We anticipate continued pressures related to our global supply chain in the next several quarters. We expect these pressures will result in some increased costs related to the expedite fees and sourcing of long lead time components. In light of this dynamic, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 83.5% to 84% for the year, and we will continue to closely monitor this situation as we have throughout the past year.
We continue to target operating on the Rule of 40 basis, where the combination of our revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margins totaled 40. The combination of our strong FY '21 revenue growth and our continued operating discipline enabled us to achieve the rule of 40 in 4 out of 4 quarters in FY '21, ahead of our initial Horizon 2 target. We continue to target achieving the Rule of 40 in FY '22. 
Given our anticipated revenue growth and the ongoing benefits from the cost reduction initiatives that we discussed at our analyst and investor meeting last year, we expect non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 32% to 33% for FY '22. We expect our typical operating margin seasonality, which translates to operating margins stepping down in Q2 and improving in the back half of the year. We anticipate our full fiscal year effective tax rate will be at or around 21% with some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. This estimate does not account for any potential future federal tax changes. We expect fiscal 2022 stock-based compensation expense in the range of $250 million to $270 million and capital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $60 million.
Finally, for the year, we expect share count to remain at approximately 62 million shares, inclusive of the expected share repurchase of $500 million during FY '22 as we previously discussed.
With that, I will turn the call back to Francois. Francois?"
90323,1684607451,2413372,"F5 Networks, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","F5, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank. Our very strong fourth quarter results are the perfect cap to our robust outperformance in FY '21. In the last 18 months, our reliance on application, both as businesses and as consumers have escalated sharply and likely forever changed.",1633,"Thank you, Frank. Our very strong fourth quarter results are the perfect cap to our robust outperformance in FY '21. In the last 18 months, our reliance on application, both as businesses and as consumers have escalated sharply and likely forever changed. Our customers are massively accelerating digital transformation to keep up with current demand and forecasted growth. They are doing this while also working to consistently meet consumers' high expectations for application performance and availability and while also ensuring their application and their consumers' data are secure. In my conversation with investors, I am often asked what is potentially misunderstood about F5?
Let me address the key points here. First, traditional on-premise applications continue to grow, complement to the prevailing expectations from 2 to 3 years ago. In fact, traditional apps are generating more traffic and more revenue than ever because every aspect of life and business relies on applications. For F5, this means BIG-IP demand will continue to grow in both software and systems form factors. 
Second, contrary to early cloud height, the vast majority of traditional applications are not being refactored. They are either remaining on-premise or they are moving to the cloud with a lift and shift motion. In other words, F5-run applications are remaining attached to F5. As a result, BIG-IP is growing both on-premise and in public clouds. Third, modern, container-based applications continue to grow at a rapid pace and not only for new applications.
Customers are bolting new modern components on to traditional applications to improve the user experience. In many cases, cloud-native application security and delivery simply are not robust enough to meet the applications needs. For F5, this means accelerating NGINX demand, enabling app security and scale for modern applications, often as a complement to BIG-IP.
And finally, given the volume of business and data that is now flowing through application and the increasingly distributed nature of applications, application security has taken on new significance. Where in the past, network and infrastructure security was a focus for customers and vendors alike, we expect application security will be one of the hottest areas of investment over the next decade. F5 is one of the few players 100% focused on application security, and we protect not just access to applications, but also how they are used. As a result, we expect our own and reputation as a leading application security provider will accelerate.
To sum up these points, F5 is differentiated and well positioned to benefit from significant emerging secular trends. There are some companies focused on applications. There also are some focused on application security. F5 is the only one that is at the epicenter of these 2 secular forces with a focus, expertise and the technology assets to secure and deliver any application anywhere.
Let's ground our opportunity in real customer trends and use cases. Last quarter, I talked about 5 sustainable customer trends we expected to drive demand across our portfolio. Let's revisit those trends with some customer examples from Q4. Number one, enterprise customers, developers and DevOps teams are using NGINX to insert security earlier in the application life cycle. NGINX with App Protect delivers robust application security for micro services with the flexibility and agility developers demand. In one example, during Q4, we secured an NGINX win with a global insurance group. They are migrating their consumer-facing insurance services into a public cloud.
For risk mitigation and security reasons, they required a scalable and container-friendly solution. They also needed enterprise-grade security capable of protecting their strategic high-value apps and guaranteeing risk management compliance, and they wanted all of this within a lightweight footprint that could drive automation, saving time and money, NGINX with App Protect was the natural choice. Trend number two, heightened security concerns and high-profile ransomware attacks are escalating demand for top-notch application security and fraud and abuse mitigation. With pronounced application growth and an ever-expanding threat landscape, including high-profile ransomware and financial stuffing attacks, we see growing demand for application security in cloud environment and rising demand for fraud and bot defense.
During Q4, a North American electric utility experienced a credential stuffing attack resulting in substantial infrastructure failure. More than 6 million customers had to reset their account passwords. Based on their experience as a BIG-IP customer, the utility turned to F5 for help. Shape was emergency onboarded, identified high volumes of automated traffic and deployed highly effective mitigation measures to stop the attack. 
Trend number three, customers are leveraging F5 for Kubernetes, containers and cloud-native architectures. Our growth in modern application continues to accelerate, driven by NGINX Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments. We are seeing several top use cases emerge for NGINX, including managing APIs, optimizing Kubernetes traffic management and load balancing cloud-native and hybrid cloud applications. With customers modern applications experiencing significant and constant swings in user demand, they need infrastructure that scales up automatically to meet user demands or down to save cloud costs.
During Q4, a Canadian online investment manager selected NGINX to move their Kubernetes-based applications into production at scale. Initially, they attempted to use a competitive solution but it lacked performance and did not integrate well with their HashiCorp console or with AWS Auto Scaling.
NGINX delivered low latency and high uptime to improve user experience and integrated seamlessly with AWS Auto Scaling to spin down half of their instances during off-peak traffic demand. Trend number 4, customers are scaling their existing hardware-based infrastructures to handle accelerating application growth, driving continued strength from BIG-IP systems. We are finding that customers are often looking to scale both their existing infrastructure and their modern apps infrastructure simultaneously. This is particularly true amongst tech and SaaS provider customers who continue to experience rapid adoption and growth of their digital products and services.
In the latest of a growing list of examples, during Q4, a high-growth SaaS provider selected F5 to help them scale both the traditional apps on BIG-IP and their modern public cloud apps with NGINX. This deal was made sweeter by the fact that NGINX displaced a competitor that wasn't performing as promised. 
Finally, Trend number 5, customers are leveraging BIG-IP for transformation, including cloud migration and automation initiatives. The demand we are seeing for BIG-IP systems in software is about more than just capacity additions. Customers also are choosing BIG-IP to drive transformation, often combining it with NGINX. F5 is particularly well suited for enterprises that operate both modern and traditional applications, which most do. NGINX integrations with BIG-IP provide differentiation over competitor and cloud-native offerings and we will extend this with integrations into Volterra at the edge.
During Q4, the BIG-IP and NGINX combination was selected by one of the largest online betting companies in Asia Pacific. A customer who processes more than 1 billion annual transactions needed hybrid on-premises data security as well as the ability to support modern app development and new engaging multimedia capabilities. They selected BIG-IP and NGINX as the foundation for their digital transformation.
Let me touch briefly on service providers and our Volterra integration progress before concluding our prepared remarks. We had a good year with service providers in FY '21. While it's true that several of the trends I have just described also apply to our service provider customers, they also faced unique challenges as a result of 4G to 5G migration and growing 5G traffic demand. Thus far, our service provider demand has come largely from 4G core network upgrades as they expand hardware capacity and upgrade existing infrastructures to handle 5G traffic. We expect software use cases will begin to emerge as carriers virtualize their 5G core.
Looking forward, our Volterra platform is generating significant interest from service providers. They view it as a way to insert their capabilities at the edge, thus creating 5G in a Box offerings. That offer us a good transition to discussing progress on the integration of Volterra. Volterra is a universal edge platform, which will enable us to insert critical application services at the edge and allow our customers to consume these services in a SaaS format. 
Our initial priority is on security offerings. We have one of the best, if not the best, application security software stack in the industry, including our Web Application Firewall, our DDoS protection, API security and bot capability. We are taking that entire security stack and integrating it natively into the Volterra platform. Our first priority is a SaaS security offering that will address the shift toward modern web apps and APIs and we are on track to deliver within our committed 12- to 18-month integration window. Our recent acquisition of Threat Stack, a leader in cloud security and workload protection is designed to accelerate our SaaS security offerings with cloud endpoint telemetry and analytics for better detection and response. Threat Stack also augments our telemetry and virtual security and technology expertise and I want to take this opportunity to once again welcome the entire Threat Stack team to F5.
In closing, we are more confident than ever in our vision and in our ability to continue to execute. The combination of application growth, our expanded solutions platform, our continuously evolving go-to-market strategy and our vision for the future of adaptive applications is resonating with customers and puts us at the epicenter of several emerging strong secular trends. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire F5 team for their steadfast focus and execution. 
As a team, we have accomplished more faster than anyone, even us thought we could. We've got more work ahead, but I am more confident than ever in our ability to achieve our goal. My thanks to our customers and partners for being on our journey with us and providing guidance and support along the way.
With that, operator, we will open the call to Q&A."

Let me start on shape. Yes, a couple of quarters ago, we did mention we were seeing elongated times to close on these proof of concept largely because customers were not in the office and getting those done, were taking a little longer. We have seen that abate over the last few months. And so we're seeing a pickup in traction and momentum there. 
And then specifically, I think in the e-commerce area, so we've got a number of customers whose applications are revenue generating, and they're constantly under these either account takeover attacks or bot attacks that are causing disruption to their business. And so they want to move pretty quickly on getting things done, either as an insurance against future attacks or oftentimes, when they're under attack, of course, things go very, very quickly because their business is disrupted. So generally, we are happy with the quarter we just had with the shape.
And in general, Meta, I would say the other thing we're seeing with customers is the -- a number of customers have been reevaluating their security posture as a result of some of the high-profile breaches that have been well publicized. And that has resulted overall in a very strong year for the fiscal year for us in security, but especially in the second half where customers have reinvigorated the motion of attaching security to BIG-IP. And we've also seen the momentum with shape and security. So that's overall the picture we're seeing in security. 
As it relates to your second question on gross margins. Yes, our gross margins have been impacted by the challenges on the supply chain, whether it's some increase in prices on some components or some expedite fees to get our supply when we need it. So the supply chain generally has been quite a challenging environment. And generally, we have managed that pretty well with our team, but it continues to be a challenging environment. And so we're going to continue to monitor the developments there and we'll adjust over time as we need to."

But inside the year, there was strong variability, especially in the first half. And what we -- so we still expect to land between 35% to 40%. We do expect we will see less variability this year than we saw last year, in part because we have better visibility into a portion of our revenues that are coming from business that is already contracted and also in part because of the scale of the business.

And our demand was even stronger than that because we ended up with a large backlog at the end of the year. So when we look at that demand in 2021, some of it actually, we think is -- I wouldn't call it an anomaly, but we think some of it are transient factors that will go away. We think there was some element of a catch-up demand because demand was quite depressed 12 months ago. 
And there also may have been a couple of F5-specific factors earlier in the year when we announced our end of software development that some customers jumped on that to refresh quickly. So we think some of these are one-off factors, but we also think that there are macro factors that are not transient, and that will proceed. And that's specifically the traffic and usage of traditional application is growing and it's going to continue to grow because these applications are generating more revenue, more customer loyalty and more large companies depend on these applications.
And so when you look at 2021, there's some element that's one-off, there's elements that are not. When we look at that and project to the future, all of that tells us that the demand for BIG-IP as a franchise, so both hardware and software, if you take that combination, we feel today that the demand for BIG-IP in the future, even beyond 2022, will be better than what we would have said a year ago.
Now what will be the mix between BIG-IP hardware and software in the future is still tough to predict because a lot of it depends on individual customer situations and when they're ready to migrate to software and when they're not. But if you take the combination of those 2 things, we certainly feel better about it today than we did 12 months ago, and that's because of factors that are not an anomaly. Those are factors that are kind of secular forces that will continue on."

So when we talked about our cloud revenue at Analyst Day, we're talking about F5 solutions being deployed in public cloud environment very specifically. So in that number,",458,"So Tim, on your second question. Just to clarify, when you said the cloud vertical. So when we talked about our cloud revenue at Analyst Day, we're talking about F5 solutions being deployed in public cloud environment very specifically. So in that number, which at the time, we said it was greater than $100 million. We do not include a lot of the business we do with hyperscaler SaaS providers, cloud providers, where we are in their infrastructure and helping them deliver applications. 
So that -- so -- but with that is clarified, our cloud number continues to grow. As you know, it's 100% software, of course. And it has grown faster than our overall software growth rate, continued this year. And where we are seeing a lot of traction in the last 12 months is in what we call private offers on marketplaces. And so essentially, that is consumed as a utility by large enterprises. And it is increasingly the case that large enterprises have spend commitments with the major public cloud providers. And we've done all the integrations, both technical and commercial, that allow these enterprises to retire their spend commitment on F5. And we've seen an acceleration of that trend. 
And it's yet another way that we are removing friction in the consumption of F5 software in public cloud, and we're getting the benefit of that in terms of growth. The other big area of growth seen in public cloud is NGINX. A number of the NGINX deployments continue to happen in public cloud and cloud-native environments. And we are seeing in NGINX -- I think as I've shared before, when you step back and you look at the success of the BIG-IP franchise over the last 20 years, one of the things that we did well was that BIG-IP consolidated a lot of functionality initially low balancing, but then security, authentication, encryption on a single platform, and that made things operationally much simpler for our customers and that created the BIG-IP franchise. 
And we're essentially seeing the emergence of the same playbook with NGINX both on-prem and in public cloud environments, the 4 modern applications. And the type of application security and delivery that we do in modern apps is not necessarily exactly the same. There are things like ingress controllers, people feel that they have to secure -- authenticate their APIs. So we offer API gateways. They need to encrypt their traffic inside their service mesh, so we offer that as well. And of course, we offer security and protection. But when you take that suite of application security and delivery services, we're seeing that playbook grow for NGINX, and that's also one of the factors of growth in public cloud for F5."

We didn't put a year on it, but we felt that, that we wanted to get to that long-term target.
By looking back at where we're at today, I would say the things that we thought will help us out around growth in SaaS and security, growth with NGINX and our new value proposition. That's going roughly per plan for the view that we had at the time. What is going better is overall the demand for BIG-IP. And I think in that going better, there's an element of it that is that is more of a secular trend that will go on for several years. And so that's kind of the mix.
Now if you step back from it, Samik, what we are seeing is 3 or 4 years ago, there was a view of the world that say, all apps are going to go to a public cloud. And that's kind of the future of the world. I'm sure you're seeing from a number of industry data points, including cloud providers actually saying that themselves that the reality for large enterprises is for the last many decades, they have always been told that they just have to get to the next thing and everything is going to go to the next thing. And the practical reality of that is it hasn't happened, right? And there's a realization now that it's not about the next thing, it's about managing a heterogeneous environment and being able to run applications in on-prem environment in public cloud, increasingly at the edge in colocation environment. 
And enterprises are very comfortable that, that's going to be their reality and the conversation has shifted not to how do I get to a single public cloud in the future, but more of an architectural conversation around, okay, I'm going to be in all these places, what is the simplest way because that creates complexity for me? What is the simplest way in which I can manage and run my applications across this hybrid environment? And those conversations -- like F5 have spent like 5 years positioning ourselves for this environment, and we're having a lot of joy because we're able to support customers on-prem, in public clouds, in private clouds, in modern applications, increasingly at the edge. And we feel that, that's going to be a secular trend that's going to last for several years. So that's what we're positioning for Samik, and that's what -- why generally, we feel good about the next 3 years."

And I think that's going to -- we continue to be focused on those organic integrations and extensions. And now Threat Stack brings a very interesting new capability to F5 in giving us visibility into these cloud environments and being able to observe the environment in which cloud workloads are running, which complements very nicely the rest of our security portfolio, which as you can see, is 100% focused on application security and essentially building the broader portfolio and application security stack. So that's been the focus. 
In terms of potential future M&A. Over time, we'll continue to evaluate building versus buying. You've heard me say before, we're very disciplined about that. We start always with our preferences to build. But if for time-to-market reasons or there's an opportunity to do something that accelerates our vision, then we look at that. The focus of that will continue to be on fulfilling this vision for adaptive applications, which is essentially about the world of running applications for large enterprises, is still very manual, fought with complexity and fought with fragility. 
And we have an architectural vision that we think is going to bring way more automation to this world. Way better uptime for applications with stronger security and with better intelligence and insights about the performance of applications. And that's what we will focus on bringing that vision to our customers, bringing it to reality. And every single quarter, organically or inorganically down the road, we are making that vision more and more of a reality.

And so at least the one that has very regularly been reported, and we see consistent gains as the web server piece, and we're very happy with the outcomes there."

So we've always had a very active community of engaged individuals around F5 technologies. Even if you go and you look at our capability in BIG-IP, given it was one of the most programmable proxy solutions available in the market, we had a very active community of contributors who are sharing iRules-based solutions and are actively contributing and continue to actively contribute through our developer community. 
Now that community has grown even further as we extended our portfolio with NGINX. As you know, just given NGINX has an open -- is an open core model and the NGINX open source attracts a wide variety of application developers that use that as a fundamental technology for their solutions. That's an additional expansion of the developer community around that.
And as we look ahead as we're expanding our portfolio and looking into building what Francois talked about with the Volterra offering, we expect that to continue to be a very important part of our technology and our strategic direction as appealing to developers and providing them the tools they need to deliver excellent digital experiences."

So we are -- so for the most part, I would say we don't compete very directly with Cloudflare. That's not a significant overlap today. I think that will grow more as we introduce our Volterra platform to wide distribution post the integration because we will play way more at the edge with SaaS security offerings for a wide range of customers. 
We do see Akamai specifically with shape security in the protecting customers against bot attacks. And I think their approach is to bundle security with their CDN, especially for customers that are using their CDN. We have an approach that's more about best-in-class efficacy for enterprise customers that place a significant premium on having world-class efficacy against bot attacks, and we do very well with that customer segment. 
So we're starting to see more and more competition with these players. And I think as a disrupter with our universal edge platform, that competition is going to grow. But we feel very good about the attributes of Volterra. And when you combine these attributes that Volterra brings as an edge universal platform and you put there the best-in-class security stack that F5 provides from shape, from BIG-IP, I think you have a formidable offering for customers that want to consume security as a service at the edge. I think that's going to be a best-in-class offering."

But on a serious note, Francois, Frank, I'll apologize if you all have already answered these questions because you all talk faster than I can listen. So with that big wind up. First off, with respect to the operating margin rebound that you all have referenced in the past, can you give all us any insight on the glide path considering the significant supply chain challenges that you face along with everybody else in the industry? And before you respond, since it's on the same topic. In the -- if I heard you correctly, the 8% to 9% of your revenue guidance you provided for fiscal '22. What are the supply chain assumptions with respect to that growth rate? What assumptions you're making underlying that? 
And finally, also related, can you address -- I assume your visibility into that 8% to 9% visibility in general has improved as an increasing number of customers that provide you with a longer-term forecast. But I just would like to confirm that, that is, in fact, the case that this boy has been continuing to improve if, in fact, customers are providing this longer-term forecast."

And so we are assuming that we are looking at that 8% to 9% on what we believe we can ship and what we believe the demand will be for those products.
In terms of the specific operating margin expansion, as you recall, we had a 32% to 34% range that we tightened up to 32% to 33%, largely driven by the gross margin hits that we have been seeing and what we expect to see because of some of those supply chain constraints through FY '22. And so we are increasing, obviously, the efficiencies that we're seeing in the business by lifting that up from where we ended at that 31.6%. So at the midpoint, almost 100 basis points increase, but we're doing that on the backs of having higher cost on the gross margin side. So actually even some more efficiencies coming through the operating margin level."

Whether or not we exit next year at a mix between hardware and software that is 50% or more of software, we -- I think we will get there eventually because the trajectory on software is one of growth. And we've said over time, we don't think hardware will be an engine of growth. 
But frankly, if we don't hit that target, largely because our hardware has totally overperformed, we will be very happy with that. And not just happy because of what's going on in the short term, but happy because what it translates to is, a, that the BIG-IP franchise overall is doing better than we thought; and b, all these customers that are extending their time purchasing hardware and not making a transition to software, it creates a bigger installed base for us to migrate to software down the road. 
So it actually is very good news over time even for our software business because we have a much bigger real estate. So we're -- what we're focused on, of course, is if you look at it in absolute dollars, we will absolutely hit the target that we gave for software revenue for F5 in our Horizon 2.
