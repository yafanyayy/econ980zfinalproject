Our thoughts are with those that have been impacted by the recent winter storms. 
Fiscal 2020 was a year that we certainly will not forget. It was a year of great hardship and adversity for so many, and our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of people who have been directly impacted by the pandemic. It is times like these that I have never been more thankful for the culture that our founders instilled in our business over 40 years ago. We have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values to do the right thing and to take care of our people. At the end of the day, it is our people and culture that make us unique. Our ability to manage unprecedented demand in the business while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters and moments of crisis is a direct result of our associates' extraordinary efforts. As a result, investing in our associates during this time was one of the easier decisions we made this year. 
During fiscal 2020, in addition to record success sharing payouts, we invested a total of approximately $2 billion on enhanced compensation and benefits for our associates. As we announced last quarter, we transitioned from temporary COVID-19 benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates. 
At the beginning of the year, I would have never thought it possible for the business to grow over $21 billion in 2020. For context, it took us 19 years as a company to achieve the first $20 billion in total sales, and we outgrew that in this year alone. This was enabled by investments we've made in the business as well as the team's exceptional execution and cross-functional alignment. 
COVID-19 and its impacts have forced us to change the way we live work and interact with one another, and there are some key learnings. The first is that the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones. And the second is that those investments enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a changing and dynamic operating environment. Investments in technology and infrastructure helped us to extend our in-store BOPUS offering to curbside in a matter of days and convert a newly opened market delivery center facility to a direct fulfillment center in order to reduce online delivery lead times and improve the customer experience. The mechanization of our upstream supply chain helped us to better flow products to our stores, while investment in tools for our store associates and met teams help to get that product to the shelves for the customer more quickly and efficiently. Our merchants leverage data analytics to collaborate with our supplier partners to make real-time adjustments to our assortments as we work to prioritize the highest demand SKUs for our customers. 
Despite one of the most difficult operating environments we have ever faced, we continue to make progress with regards to our strategic initiatives. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening of various supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track. We have also restarted many of the in-store investments that were paused at the outset of the pandemic. 
As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, we believe that the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant. 
Now turning to our financial highlights. Our results for the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. Fiscal 2020 sales grew $21.9 billion to $132.1 billion, up 19.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 19.7% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 20.6%. Diluted earnings per share increased 16.5% to $11.94 for the year. 
We finished this year with another exceptional quarter as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Sales for the fourth quarter grew $6.5 billion to $32.3 billion, up 25.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.5% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 for the fourth quarter. 
Our results this quarter, once again, were driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average and Mexico posted double-digit comps in local currency. 
As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter, and we saw a strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers. We had a record holiday season as our modified approach to Black Friday and gift center events clearly resonated with our customers. 
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support record level web traffic on a consistent basis throughout the year. For the quarter, sales leverage in our digital platforms increased approximately 83% versus the prior year and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. For the year, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 86% versus last year and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. 
We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot, all with the goal of improving the customer experience. One of the customer enhancement tools that had to be completely reimagined in the COVID-19 environment was our in-store workshop program. For years, we have offered a number of different in-store workshops, including our kids' workshops. Until COVID-19, there wasn't an online option for these workshops, but in a few short months, we were able to successfully transition 100% of our workshop content online. The live streaming platform has allowed us to go from an average of 5 in-store workshops per month to approximately 40 online live streaming workshops per month. These online workshops have driven a deeper level of engagement and connectivity with our participating customers. 
One thing that did not change in fiscal 2020 is our disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. We remain committed to growing our dividend as earnings grow. As a result, today, we announced our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6.60 per share. 
As we look to fiscal year 2021, Richard will provide some perspective into the factors that have the potential to impact the company's performance. I'm incredibly proud of all we have accomplished in this unprecedented year, and I want to close by thanking our associates for the way they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. I also want to thank our supplier partners for their continued support and partnership throughout this year. In addition, I would like to welcome the associates from HD Supply back to The Home Depot family. 
As we close fiscal 2020, we have nearly completed our multiyear accelerated investment program that has positioned us well to serve our customers in this dynamic and changing environment. We have more conviction than ever that we have been investing in the right areas of the business, and we'll continue to invest to extend our competitive advantage and enable market share growth in any environment. We believe that our scale, combined with our low-cost position and continued focus on the customer, will help us win in a highly competitive marketplace and deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to our associates and supplier partners for their unwavering dedication to our customers over the last year. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand across our business. For the third quarter in a row, comps in the U.S. have been approximately 25%. With remarkable consistency, comps in the U.S. were at or above 20% for 36 of the past 39 weeks. And as you might expect, this level of demand pressured our supply chain. But our supply chain teams and supplier partners responded and continue making progress. Over the course of the third and fourth quarters, we made significant improvements to our in-stock positions, while supporting massive sales volumes. While there's always room for improvement and there are some current port delays, we believe we are well positioned as we head into our busy spring selling season. 
Moving on to comp performance in the fourth quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps, led by our lumber and indoor garden departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.8% and comp transactions increased 12.6%. Similar to the last 2 quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was supported by strong project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products as well as continued inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber. 
During the quarter, we continued to experience significant volatility in lumber prices. As we exited the third quarter, lumber prices were falling sharply off the historic highs seen back in September. However, during the fourth quarter, pricing for both framing and panel lumber reversed and set new near-term highs. Despite the elevated prices, unit comps in our lumber department accelerated further from the double-digit levels seen in the third quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 220 basis points. Additionally, our comp transaction growth was supported by the same persistent strength in both online and in-store transactions that we have experienced in the prior 2 quarters. During the fourth quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories, including appliances, vinyl plank flooring and vanities. 
From a customer standpoint, during the quarter, we saw double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers, with sales growth from our DIY customers once again outpacing that of our Pro customers. DIY sales growth was very consistent with the strong double-digit growth experienced in the second and third quarters. 
Sales to our Pro customer continued to accelerate, posting the best quarter of growth in 2020. As we've mentioned all year, our smaller Pro customers maintained consistent growth and posted strong double-digit growth in every month of the quarter. Growth from our larger Pro customers continued to accelerate, also growing double digits each month of the quarter. While the operating environment is still recovering for many of our larger Pro customers, we're encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing as backlogs are growing. 
Shifting to our DIY customers. We continue to benefit from heightened engagement from both new and existing customers. As our customers continue to spend more time at home, they're telling us their project lists are growing. After completing a project, we see many of our DIY customers take on additional and oftentimes more complex projects with a renewed sense of confidence. During the fourth quarter, our customers exhibited a lot of trends similar to what we saw throughout 2020. For instance, we saw continued strength in outdoor living categories like patio furniture, grills and outdoor power equipment, as customers tried to extend the outdoor living season. We also saw strong performance from popular interior project categories like Vanity's faucets, moldings and interior lighting. 
Customer engagement in our annual Black Friday and gift center events was strong. As I previewed on last quarter's call, we took a different approach to our events this year to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We made deeper buys on fewer SKUs. We changed the way we use our laydown areas and end caps, and we extended our events over several weeks to avoid driving too much traffic on any 1 single day, and we could not be more thrilled with the results. 
Over the holiday season, our customers said they wanted a sense of normality. They told us they wanted to decorate for the holidays and make the most of the season, while spending more time at home with family. So they bought big and they bought early. And we saw a record level of sell-through with our decorative holiday assortment. 
During the quarter, our interconnected and digital assets continued to perform well. Over the last several years, we've rebuilt our website and invested across our platforms to upgrade our infrastructure and improve the shopping experience. These investments allowed us to handle the enormous growth in web traffic and convert more of that traffic into sales. During fiscal 2020, homedepot.com had more than 3.6 billion visits and our conversion rate increased double digits across all platforms, including our app, mobile and desktop. 
Turning our attention to the upcoming spring season, I could not be more excited about our comprehensive lineup book products, including our #1 position in outdoor power equipment. As we've discussed, the cordless outdoor power market continues to outpace growth of the gas market. Cordless tools are easier to use, more environmentally friendly and have the power and run time to get most jobs done. Like we have done with our tool department, we are resetting our outdoor power equipment base by branded battery platform. Customers can now shop our leading and exclusive lineup by platform including Makita, Milwaukee, RYOBI, Toro and DEWALT. We are thrilled with the results and expect these resets will be complete in the first quarter. 
This spring, we're excited to introduce a new lineup of outdoor power from RYOBI, the #1 cordless outdoor power brand, the new RYOBI HP High-Performance Brushless product was introduced in our tool department last year. We are now expanding it into cordless mowers, trimmers and blowers. The cordless mowers come with 70 minutes of run time and we are excited about the additional innovation coming in the product pipeline. 
As we look forward to spring, we know that now, more than ever, the home has never been more important. We feel great about our position as the #1 retailer for home improvement, and we look forward to serving our customers in the busy spring selling season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the face of what was a difficult year for many, including for many of our associates, I am proud of the actions we took to take care of our people, our customers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $32.3 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion or 25.1% from last year. Our total company comps were positive 24.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.4% in November, 22.4% in December and 26.5% in January. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.3% in November, 21.8% in December and 28.4% in January. All 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in local currency. 
For the year, our sales totaled a record $132.1 billion, with sales growth of $21.9 billion versus fiscal 2019. For the year, total company comp sales increased 19.7%, and U.S. comp sales increased 20.6%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.6%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix, shrink and pressure from rising transportation costs. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the year, our gross margin was 34%. 
During the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 20.9% of sales, representing an increase of approximately 25 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. First, we incurred approximately $110 million of nonrecurring expense related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition creating approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Second, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19 and transitioned our temporary support programs to permanent compensation enhancements, which we announced last quarter. These expenses totaled approximately $340 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage. Third, we incurred approximately $55 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. Fourth, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $45 million compared to last year. And finally, during the fourth quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 130 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 130 basis points of leverage is approximately 80 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our outperformance for our biannual store success sharing program and store- and field-based management bonuses for the second half. 
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 12.7% and for the year was approximately 13.8%. Excluding the onetime expense associated with the completion of the HD Supply acquisition, our operating margin would have been 13% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the year. 
Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $35 million to $327 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels compared to 1 year ago. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, and for fiscal 2020 was 24.2%. Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.65, an increase of approximately 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The onetime expenses related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition of approximately $110 million negatively impacted our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 were $11.94, an increase of 16.5% compared to fiscal 2019. 
During the year, we opened 5 new stores and ended the year with a store count of 2,296. Retail selling square footage was approximately 239 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $544, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.6 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion versus last year, and inventory turns were 5.8x, and up from 4.9x from the same period last year. 
Moving on to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. We will continue to invest in the business. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we invested approximately $2.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. We also invested approximately $8 billion in the acquisition of HD Supply to enhance our capabilities and drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. We completed this acquisition on December 24. During the year, we paid approximately $6.5 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And as you heard from Craig, today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10%. 
In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchases as part of several steps we took to further enhance our strong liquidity position. Prior to that suspension, we repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock in fiscal 2020. We expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and  we will also maintain an enhanced cash position of at least $4 billion during fiscal 2021. 
During fiscal 2020, we raised approximately $8 billion of staggered maturity, long-term debt to enhance our liquidity position, partially fund the acquisition of HD Supply and repay approximately $2.75 billion of senior notes. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchases back in March. 
Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. The strong and consistent demand environment we've seen over the past 9 months has continued into February. Our customers tell us that their home has never been more important and that they will continue to take on home improvement projects. The housing environment remains strong as increased demand for single-family homes has driven housing turnover and home price appreciation. 
However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to the course of the pandemic, the distribution of vaccines, short-term fiscal policy and how these developments will impact the broader economy and ultimately, consumer spending. Given these uncertainties, we are limited in our ability to forecast demand for the year, particularly as it relates to the back half. For this reason, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2021. 
While we are not able to predict how consumer spending will evolve, if the demand environment during the back half of fiscal 2020 were to persist through fiscal 2021, it would imply flat to slightly positive comparable sales growth. We calculate this by assuming the sales dollar level of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter continues throughout 2021, adjusting for historical seasonality. In this demand environment, we calculate our fiscal 2021 operating margin would be at least 14%. 
Let me give a little more color around the drivers of our operating margin and investments for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we experienced pressure to gross margin, notably from product mix and shrink. For fiscal 2021, we expect continued pressure to our gross margin from higher transportation costs and shrink. In addition, we will experience some pressure in gross margin as we continue to build out our One Supply Chain network. Remember that the majority of the costs associated with opening and operating our supply chain facilities are accounted for in our cost of goods sold. 
As we transition from 2020 into 2021, our operating expenses will reflect the move away from temporary COVID-related pay and benefits to permanent wage investments, the continuation of strategic investments in the business and the impact of lapping areas of underspend, such as understaffed stores that we realized last year. In fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $2 billion of expense related to enhanced pay and benefits for our associates. Last quarter, we transitioned away from our temporary support programs in response to COVID and increased permanent compensation for our frontline hourly associates by approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis. In addition, we also incurred approximately $240 million of expense related to COVID operational costs during fiscal 2020, primarily in the form of personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and for enhanced cleaning of our stores. As long as the COVID environment persists, we would expect to incur approximately $250 million of COVID-related operating expenses on an annualized basis for fiscal 2021, primarily related to PPE, additional cleaning as well as extended leave for associates who were directly impacted by COVID-19. 
During fiscal 2020, we chose to defer some of our in-store strategic investments, both capital and expense, to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers. We expect to complete these investments in fiscal 2021. As we look back on our investments from 2018 to 2020, we believe that we focused on the right areas, improve the customer experience and grew significantly faster than our market. As we move forward, we are committed to investing in our business to stay ahead of customer expectations and further enhance the customer experience with 2 main objectives in mind: first, to deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment; and second, to further strengthen our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement, with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. This approach will result in a steadier level of investment in both capital and expense going forward. For fiscal 2021, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales. It is our intent to make those investments on a steadier cadence and to drive operating expense leverage while preserving the ability to adjust our investments as needed. 
We estimate that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be similar to what we reported in fiscal 2020. As we begin 2021, we believe that we've positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled flexibility in our operating model as well as our financial model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen this position and extend our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market, regardless of what the environment may look like.

And so that was actually the intent behind the sort of margin case that we put forward. And so again, just to sort of recap how you get to a 14% margin in that case that we provided. Let's start with the operating expense side. You have a few primary drivers, and I'll tick through those. 
First, you have the permanent investment in wage for our hourly associates as we transition from temporary support programs in the fourth quarter. You have the continuation of COVID-related operational expenses to keep our stores and our associates safe. You have the overlap of some expense benefit from understaffing in the first half last year as sales ramped up. So the period, as we were growing staff, to meet the sharp acceleration in sales. So that is the year-over-year overlap that you asked about. 
And then if you look on the cost of goods side, just to cover and come all the way down to 14, we're expecting to see continued pressure from transportation costs, continued pressure from shrink. You'll see pressure reflecting the opening up of our One Supply Chain buildings as we ramp up capacity utilization in that network and a return to a more normal stance with respect to events. And finally, the last comment, getting us to the 14 in that case, is that you'll see slightly higher noncash amortization related to the HD Supply acquisition. That's about 10 basis points of an impact to operating margin, but that's noncash. So that's the bridge to 14."

If we go back to 2017, realizing that a lot of things have changed, the One HD investments, I think, were slated somewhere of a 20 basis point hit to margin and a benefit is up too much as 40 basis points.

We said that we needed to do that because we had to get ahead of where the customer was taking us. And that's why we made the investment that we did in terms of the $11.1 billion. And the intent behind that was twofold. Number one, we wanted to be able to grow faster than the market, gaining share in the marketplace and then accelerate our incremental op margin dollar growth. 
Since we started the program in fiscal 2017 through '18 to '20 and market share is a little elusive in our market. But based on the best data we can get, we believe that we've captured about 275 basis points of share growth during that time frame. And so that has -- during the whole investment, we're taking share. And so going forward, our approach is to make sure that we are investing on a more steady cadence what we need to in the business to make sure that we can stay ahead of the customer and we can continue to gain those kind of accelerated share growth opportunities going forward. And our focus is around really optimizing op margin dollars. And if we can do that and drive incremental margin dollars, we'll let rate fall where it falls."

Those type products, copper and wire, lumber, obviously and all stick goods, those are priced to market by virtually everyone in the marketplace. So we don't have a lot of anxiety around managing the commodity flows. 
As it comes to transportation and which are real transportation costs and suppliers who are obviously seeing some cost pressures, we've managed that for 41 years. There's been periods of hyperinflation. There have been periods of muted inflation. We run this as a portfolio. We work closely with our supplier partners to be the advocate for value for the customer. And as I think about all that's going on now, I reflect back to the tariffs and I guess I want for that was our biggest issue when we were managing tariffs.

Thanks for joining our call this morning. We hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our thoughts are with those that have been impacted by the recent winter storms.

Our thoughts are with those that have been impacted by the recent winter storms.  
Fiscal 2020 was a year that we certainly will not forget. It was a year of great hardship and adversity for so many, and our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of people who have been directly impacted by the pandemic. It is times like these that I have never been more thankful for the culture that our founders instilled in our business over 40 years ago. We have navigated this crisis by aligning our decisions and actions to some of our most important values to do the right thing and to take care of our people. 
At the end of the day, it is our people and culture that make us unique. Our ability to manage unprecedented demand in the business while navigating the global pandemic and supporting our communities through multiple natural disasters and moments of crisis is a direct result of our associates' extraordinary efforts. As a result, investing in our associates during this time was one of the easier decisions we made this year.  
During fiscal 2020, in addition to record success sharing payouts, we invested a total of approximately $2 billion on enhanced compensation and benefits for our associates. As we announced last quarter, we transitioned from temporary COVID-19 benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for our frontline hourly associates.  
At the beginning of the year, I would have never thought it possible for the business to grow over $21 billion in 2020. For context, it took us 19 years as a company to achieve the first $20 billion in total sales, and we outgrew that in this year alone. This was enabled by investments we've made in the business as well as the team's exceptional execution and cross-functional alignment.  
COVID-19 and its impacts have forced us to change the way we live, work and interact with one another, and there are some key learnings. The first is that the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones. And the second is that those investments enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a changing and dynamic operating environment. 
Investments in technology and infrastructure helped us to extend our in-store BOPUS offering to curbside in a matter of days and convert a newly opened market delivery center facility to a direct fulfillment center in order to reduce online delivery lead times and improve the customer experience. The mechanization of our upstream supply chain helped us to better flow products to our stores, while investment in tools for our store associates and MET teams help to get that product to the shelves for the customer more quickly and efficiently. Our merchants leverage data analytics to collaborate with our supplier partners to make real-time adjustments to our assortments as we work to prioritize the highest demand SKUs for our customers.  
Despite one of the most difficult operating environments we have ever faced, we continue to make progress with regards to our strategic initiatives. Key components of our One Home Depot strategy, such as opening of various supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancements to the digital experience remain on track. We have also restarted many of the in-store investments that were paused at the outset of the pandemic.  
As customers engage with The Home Depot, we see a continued blend of both the physical and digital worlds. As a result, we believe that the distinct competitive advantages and overarching benefits of an interconnected One Home Depot strategy have never been more relevant.
Now turning to our financial highlights. Our results for the year clearly indicate that for many customers, the home has never been more important. Fiscal 2020 sales grew $21.9 billion to $132.1 billion, up 19.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 19.7% from last year, and our U.S. comps were positive 20.6%. Diluted earnings per share increased 16.5% to $11.94 for the year.  
We finished this year with another exceptional quarter as we saw the continuation of outsized demand for home improvement projects. Sales for the fourth quarter grew $6.5 billion to $32.3 billion, up 25.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 24.5% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 25%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.65 for the fourth quarter.  
Our results this quarter, once again, were driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average and Mexico posted double-digit comps in local currency.  
As Ted will detail, both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter, and we saw a strong double-digit growth from both the Pro and DIY customers. We had a record holiday season as our modified approach to Black Friday and gift center events clearly resonated with our customers.  
Our interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have continued to support record level web traffic on a consistent basis throughout the year. For the quarter, sales leverage in our digital platforms increased approximately 83% versus the prior year and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. For the year, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 86% versus last year and approximately 60% of online orders were fulfilled through a store.  
We continue to invest in our digital assets, introducing new capabilities in different ways to engage with The Home Depot, all with the goal of improving the customer experience. One of the customer enhancement tools that had to be completely reimagined in the COVID-19 environment was our in-store workshop program. For years, we have offered a number of different in-store workshops, including our kids' workshops. 
Until COVID-19, there wasn't an online option for these workshops, but in a few short months, we were able to successfully transition 100% of our workshop content online. The live streaming platform has allowed us to go from an average of 5 in-store workshops per month to approximately 40 online live streaming workshops per month. These online workshops have driven a deeper level of engagement and connectivity with our participating customers.  
One thing that did not change in fiscal 2020 is our disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. We remain committed to growing our dividend as earnings grow. As a result, today, we announced our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.65 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6.60 per share.  As we look to fiscal year 2021, Richard will provide some perspective into the factors that have the potential to impact the company's performance. 
I'm incredibly proud of all we have accomplished in this unprecedented year, and I want to close by thanking our associates for the way they have lived our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. I also want to thank our supplier partners for their continued support and partnership throughout this year. In addition, I would like to welcome the associates from HD Supply back to The Home Depot family.  
As we close fiscal 2020, we have nearly completed our multiyear accelerated investment program that has positioned us well to serve our customers in this dynamic and changing environment. We have more conviction than ever that we have been investing in the right areas of the business, and we'll continue to invest to extend our competitive advantage and enable market share growth in any environment. We believe that our scale, combined with our low-cost position and continued focus on the customer, will help us win in a highly competitive marketplace and deliver exceptional returns for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to our associates and supplier partners for their unwavering dedication to our customers over the last year.  
During the fourth quarter, we continue to experience unprecedented levels of demand across our business. For the third quarter in a row, comps in the U.S. have been approximately 25%. With remarkable consistency, comps in the U.S. were at or above 20% for 36 of the past 39 weeks. And as you might expect, this level of demand pressured our supply chain. But our supply chain teams and supplier partners responded and continue making progress. 
Over the course of the third and fourth quarters, we made significant improvements to our in-stock positions, while supporting massive sales volumes. While there's always room for improvement and there are some current port delays, we believe we are well positioned as we head into our busy spring selling season.  
Moving on to comp performance in the fourth quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted double-digit comps, led by our lumber and indoor garden departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.8% and comp transactions increased 12.6%. Similar to the last 2 quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was supported by strong project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products as well as continued inflation in certain commodity categories like lumber.  
During the quarter, we continued to experience significant volatility in lumber prices. As we exited the third quarter, lumber prices were falling sharply off the historic highs seen back in September. However, during the fourth quarter, pricing for both framing and panel lumber reversed and set new near-term highs. Despite the elevated prices, unit comps in our lumber department accelerated further from the double-digit levels seen in the third quarter.  
During the fourth quarter, inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 220 basis points. Additionally, our comp transaction growth was supported by the same persistent strength in both online and in-store transactions that we have experienced in the prior 2 quarters. During the fourth quarter, big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000, were up approximately 23%. We saw strong performance across a number of big-ticket categories, including appliances, vinyl plank flooring and vanities.  
From a customer standpoint, during the quarter, we saw double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers, with sales growth from our DIY customers once again outpacing that of our Pro customers. DIY sales growth was very consistent with the strong double-digit growth experienced in the second and third quarters.  
Sales to our Pro customer continued to accelerate, posting the best quarter of growth in 2020. As we've mentioned all year, our smaller Pro customers maintained consistent growth and posted strong double-digit growth in every month of the quarter. Growth from our larger Pro customers continued to accelerate, also growing double digits each month of the quarter. While the operating environment is still recovering for many of our larger Pro customers, we're encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing as backlogs are growing.
Shifting to our DIY customers. We continue to benefit from heightened engagement from both new and existing customers. As our customers continue to spend more time at home, they're telling us their project lists are growing. After completing a project, we see many of our DIY customers take on additional and oftentimes more complex projects with a renewed sense of confidence. 
During the fourth quarter, our customers exhibited a lot of trends similar to what we saw throughout 2020. For instance, we saw continued strength in outdoor living categories like patio furniture, grills and outdoor power equipment, as customers tried to extend the outdoor living season. We also saw strong performance from popular interior project categories like vanities, faucets, moldings and interior lighting.  
Customer engagement in our annual Black Friday and gift center events was strong. As I previewed on last quarter's call, we took a different approach to our events this year to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and customers. We made deeper buys on fewer SKUs. We changed the way we use our laydown areas and in camps, and we extended our events over several weeks to avoid driving too much traffic on any 1 single day, and we could not be more thrilled with the results.  
Over the holiday season, our customers said they wanted a sense of normalcy. They told us they wanted to decorate for the holidays and make the most of the season, while spending more time at home with family. So they bought big and they bought early. And we saw a record level of sell-through with our decorative holiday assortment.  
During the quarter, our interconnected and digital assets continued to perform well. Over the last several years, we've rebuilt our website and invested across our platforms to upgrade our infrastructure and improve the shopping experience. These investments allowed us to handle the enormous growth in web traffic and convert more of that traffic into sales. During fiscal 2020, homedepot.com had more than 3.6 billion visits and our conversion rate increased double digits across all platforms, including our app, mobile and desktop.  
Turning our attention to the upcoming spring season, I could not be more excited about our comprehensive lineup book products, including our #1 position in outdoor power equipment. As we've discussed, the cordless outdoor power market continues to outpace growth of the gas market. Cordless tools are easier to use, more environmentally friendly and have the power and run time to get most jobs done. Like we have done with our tool department, we are resetting our outdoor power equipment base by branded battery platform. Customers can now shop our leading and exclusive lineup by platform including Makita, Milwaukee, RYOBI, Toro and DEWALT. We are thrilled with the results and expect these resets will be complete in the first quarter.  
This spring, we're excited to introduce a new lineup of outdoor power from RYOBI, the #1 cordless outdoor power brand, the new RYOBI HP high-performance brushless product was introduced in our tool department last year. We are now expanding it into cordless mowers, trimmers and blowers. The cordless mowers come with 70 minutes of run time and we are excited about the additional innovation coming in the product pipeline.  
As we look forward to spring, we know that now, more than ever, the home has never been more important. We feel great about our position as the #1 retailer for home improvement, and we look forward to serving our customers in the busy spring selling season. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the face of what was a difficult year for many, including for many of our associates, I am proud of the actions we took to take care of our people, our customers and our communities. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $32.3 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion or 25.1% from last year. Our total company comps were positive 24.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.4% in November, 22.4% in December and 26.5% in January. Comps in the U.S. were positive 25% for the quarter with positive comps of 24.3% in November, 21.8% in December and 28.4% in January. All 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in local currency.  
For the year, our sales totaled a record $132.1 billion, with sales growth of $21.9 billion versus fiscal 2019. For the year, total company comp sales increased 19.7%, and U.S. comp sales increased 20.6%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.6%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin was negatively impacted during the quarter by several factors, including product mix, shrink and pressure from rising transportation costs. Mix pressure from lumber alone negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the year, our gross margin was 34%.  
During the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 20.9% of sales, representing an increase of approximately 25 basis points compared to last year. Let me take a moment to comment on a few of our expense items. 
First, we incurred approximately $110 million of nonrecurring expense related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition creating approximately 30 basis points of operating expense deleverage. 
Second, during the quarter, we continued to support our associates with enhanced benefits in response to COVID-19 and transitioned our temporary support programs to permanent compensation enhancements, which we announced last quarter. These expenses totaled approximately $340 million during the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately 105 basis points of expense deleverage. 
Third, we incurred approximately $55 million of operational COVID-related expenses, including personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and enhanced cleaning of our stores, resulting in approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. 
Fourth, we recorded expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $325 million, an increase of approximately $45 million compared to last year. 
And finally, during the fourth quarter, we showed strong expense control in other areas of the business and drove approximately 130 basis points of expense leverage. Included in this 130 basis points of leverage is approximately 80 basis points of pressure driven by accrued bonus expense primarily related to our outperformance for our biannual store success sharing program and store- and field-based management bonuses for the second half.  
Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 12.7% and for the year was approximately 13.8%. Excluding the onetime expense associated with the completion of the HD Supply acquisition, our operating margin would have been 13% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the year.  
Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter grew by $35 million to $327 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels compared to 1 year ago. 
In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, and for fiscal 2020 was 24.2%. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.65, an increase of approximately 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The onetime expenses related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition of approximately $110 million negatively impacted our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.09. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 were $11.94, an increase of 16.5% compared to fiscal 2019.  
During the year, we opened 5 new stores and ended the year with a store count of 2,296. Retail selling square footage was approximately 239 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $544, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $16.6 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion versus last year, and inventory turns were 5.8x, up from 4.9x from the same period last year.  
Moving on to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. We will continue to invest in the business. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and through share repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we invested approximately $2.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. We also invested approximately $8 billion in the acquisition of HD Supply to enhance our capabilities and drive accelerated sales growth in a highly fragmented MRO space. We completed this acquisition on December 24. 
During the year, we paid approximately $6.5 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And as you heard from Craig, today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 10%.  
In mid-March, we suspended our share repurchases as part of several steps we took to further enhance our strong liquidity position. Prior to that suspension, we repurchased approximately $600 million or 2.5 million shares of outstanding stock in fiscal 2020. We expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and  we will also maintain an enhanced cash position of at least $4 billion during fiscal 2021.  
During fiscal 2020, we raised approximately $8 billion of staggered maturity, long-term debt to enhance our liquidity position, partially fund the acquisition of HD Supply and repay approximately $2.75 billion of senior notes. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 40.8%, down from 45% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease primarily reflects our decision to temporarily enhance our liquidity position, including the suspension of our share repurchases back in March.  
Now I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. The strong and consistent demand environment we've seen over the past 9 months has continued into February. Our customers tell us that their home has never been more important and that they will continue to take on home improvement projects. The housing environment remains strong as increased demand for single-family homes has driven housing turnover and home price appreciation.  
However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to the course of the pandemic, the distribution of vaccines, short-term fiscal policy and how these developments will impact the broader economy and ultimately, consumer spending. Given these uncertainties, we are limited in our ability to forecast demand for the year, particularly as it relates to the back half. For this reason, we are not providing guidance for fiscal 2021.  
While we are not able to predict how consumer spending will evolve, if the demand environment during the back half of fiscal 2020 were to persist through fiscal 2021, it would imply flat to slightly positive comparable sales growth. We calculate this by assuming the sales dollar level of demand that we saw in the fourth quarter continues throughout 2021, adjusting for historical seasonality. In this demand environment, we calculate our fiscal 2021 operating margin would be at least 14%.  
Let me give a little more color around the drivers of our operating margin and investments for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, we experienced pressure to gross margin, notably from product mix and shrink. For fiscal 2021, we expect continued pressure to our gross margin from higher transportation costs and shrink. In addition, we will experience some pressure in gross margin as we continue to build out our One Supply Chain network. Remember that the majority of the costs associated with opening and operating our supply chain facilities are accounted for in our cost of goods sold.  
As we transition from 2020 into 2021, our operating expenses will reflect the move away from temporary COVID-related pay and benefits to permanent wage investments, the continuation of strategic investments in the business and the impact of lapping areas of underspend, such as understaffed stores that we realized last year. 
In fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $2 billion of expense related to enhanced pay and benefits for our associates. Last quarter, we transitioned away from our temporary support programs in response to COVID and increased permanent compensation for our frontline hourly associates by approximately $1 billion on an annualized basis. 
In addition, we also incurred approximately $240 million of expense related to COVID operational costs during fiscal 2020, primarily in the form of personal protective equipment for our associates and customers and for enhanced cleaning of our stores. As long as the COVID environment persists, we would expect to incur approximately $250 million of COVID-related operating expenses on an annualized basis for fiscal 2021, primarily related to PPE, additional cleaning as well as extended leave for associates who were directly impacted by COVID-19.  
During fiscal 2020, we chose to defer some of our in-store strategic investments, both capital and expense, to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers. We expect to complete these investments in fiscal 2021. As we look back on our investments from 2018 to 2020, we believe that we focused on the right areas, improve the customer experience and grew significantly faster than our market. 
As we move forward, we are committed to investing in our business to stay ahead of customer expectations and further enhance the customer experience with 2 main objectives in mind: first, to deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment; and second, to further strengthen our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement, with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. 
This approach will result in a steadier level of investment in both capital and expense going forward. For fiscal 2021, we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales. It is our intent to make those investments on a steadier cadence and to drive operating expense leverage while preserving the ability to adjust our investments as needed.  
We estimate that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be similar to what we reported in fiscal 2020. As we begin 2021, we believe that we've positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled flexibility in our operating model as well as our financial model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen this position and extend our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market, regardless of what the environment may look like.

And so that was actually the intent behind the sort of margin case that we put forward. And so again, just to sort of recap how you get to a 14% margin in that case that we provided. Let's start with the operating expense side. You have a few primary drivers, and I'll tick through those. 
First, you have the permanent investment in wage for our hourly associates as we transition from temporary support programs in the fourth quarter. You have the continuation of COVID-related operational expenses to keep our stores and our associates safe. You have the overlap of some expense benefit from understaffing in the first half last year as sales ramped up. So the period, as we were growing staff, to meet the sharp acceleration in sales. So that is the year-over-year overlap that you asked about. 
And then if you look on the cost of goods side, just to cover and come all the way down to 14, we're expecting to see continued pressure from transportation costs, continued pressure from shrink. You'll see pressure reflecting the opening up of our One Supply Chain buildings as we ramp up capacity utilization in that network and a return to a more normal stance with respect to events. And finally, the last comment, getting us to the 14 in that case, is that you'll see slightly higher noncash amortization related to the HD Supply acquisition. That's about 10 basis points of an impact to operating margin, but that's noncash. So that's the bridge to 14."

If we go back to 2017, realizing that a lot of things have changed, the One HD investments, I think, were slated somewhere of a 20 basis point hit to margin and a benefit is up too much as 40 basis points. If that's still the case, and then we do have COVID costs rolling off, it feels like margins are being held back a bit, meaning they could be a good amount higher. Are you -- I don't know if your commitment or your philosophy has changed in some of what you're speaking about regarding continuing a certain level of investment to maintain that growth ahead of the market? Or will you allow margin to go up, not gross per se, but more SG&A leverage, if you retain a lot of the sales from this period going forward."

We said that we needed to do that because we had to get ahead of where the customer was taking us. And that's why we made the investment that we did in terms of the $11.1 billion. And the intent behind that was twofold. Number one, we wanted to be able to grow faster than the market, gaining share in the marketplace and then accelerate our incremental op margin dollar growth. 
Since we started the program in fiscal 2017 through '18 to '20 and market share is a little elusive in our market. But based on the best data we can get, we believe that we've captured about 275 basis points of share growth during that time frame. And so that has -- during the whole investment, we're taking share. And so going forward, our approach is to make sure that we are investing on a more steady cadence what we need to in the business to make sure that we can stay ahead of the customer and we can continue to gain those kind of accelerated share growth opportunities going forward. And our focus is around really optimizing op margin dollars. And if we can do that and drive incremental margin dollars, we'll let rate fall where it falls."

Now that the investment program is substantially complete, you're going to see us return to a steadier, more consistent investment posture. And so just think about -- if you're talking about modeling, what that means, we had a 3-year period where in many periods, expenses grew faster than sales because of the expense component of the plan. And CapEx, obviously, was elevated. 
What we're telling you today is going forward, we are moving to that steady and consistent cadence. And so as Craig said, capital expenditures will approximate 2% of sales. And then expenses associated with it are assumed within the margin case that we laid out. And from this point going forward, we intend to deliver operating expense leverage on a consistent basis."

Those type products, copper and wire, lumber, obviously and all stick goods, those are priced to market by virtually everyone in the marketplace. So we don't have a lot of anxiety around managing the commodity flows. 
As it comes to transportation and which are real transportation costs and suppliers who are obviously seeing some cost pressures, we've managed that for 41 years. There's been periods of hyperinflation. There have been periods of muted inflation. We run this as a portfolio. We work closely with our supplier partners to be the advocate for value for the customer. And as I think about all that's going on now, I reflect back to the tariffs and I guess I want for that was our biggest issue when we were managing tariffs.

Fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start as we grew the business by over $9 billion compared to the first quarter of last year. Sales for the first quarter were $37.5 billion, up 32.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 31% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 29.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in the first quarter, up from $2.08 in the first quarter last year. 
Our results this quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average, and Mexico posted double-digit comps. Both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter. And as Ted will detail, we saw strong double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers. 
We continue to effectively manage the outsized demand for home improvement products seen throughout most of last year despite disruptions in global supply chains that were further exasperated by port congestion during the quarter. We leveraged the scale of our supply chain and partnered with our vendors to maintain our in-stock positions and prioritized key SKUs in high-demand categories. 
While we continue to see strong level of engagement across our digital platforms, we saw more of our customers return to our stores. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 27% versus the first quarter last year, and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store. 
We continue to roll out new capabilities, such as mixed cart selling from store, that remove friction for both our customers and associates. The mixed cart feature enables associates to more efficiently and effectively serve the total project needs for a customer as products from both the website and store can be added to a single transaction. 
We also continue to drive interconnected enhancements in other areas of the business to solve customer pain points. In tool rental, for example, we will soon expand our rent online pilot chain-wide, enabling rent online, pickup in-store capabilities for all 1,300-plus tool rental locations in the U.S. and Canada. This will enhance the experience for our busy Pro and DIY customers and complement additional investments we are making to expand our rental footprint and increase our assortment and delivery capabilities. 
We are focused on continuing to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. Our efforts will continue to support what we believe is our winning formula: deliver the best shopping experience in home improvement, extend our position as a low-cost provider with a relentless focus on productivity and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. We believe this strategy will help us deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment. 
The build-out of our One Home Depot supply chain vision is a wonderful example of our strategy in action. Enhanced fulfillment capabilities will not only create a better customer experience, but they will also expand the breadth of our current opportunity set from both a product and customer standpoint. The ability to combine this growth potential with scale to create the low-cost network in home improvement is a formula that we believe delivers long-term value creation for our customers, supplier partners and shareholders. 
During the quarter, we continued to build out our One Supply chain vision by opening several new facilities, and we are very excited with the progress we continue to make on this key strategic priority. 
We have now been operating in this unprecedented demand environment for over a year and continue to align around a few key learnings. First, the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones. And second, they have enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a challenging and dynamic operating environment. 
As a result, we have managed unprecedented levels of web traffic, record levels of product flow through our supply chain, all while improving customer service levels in our stores. These factors, coupled with our world-class associates and strong partnership with suppliers, have enabled us to meet outsized demand week after week. 
Our cultures remain our North Star as their decisions are anchored to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our ability to continue investing for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company's history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. 
I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. 
We continued to experience unprecedented levels of demand during the first quarter, with comps accelerating to more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of last year. This elevated demand in transportation headwinds are pressuring parts of the supply chain, but our teams continue to work together with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures. 
Moving to our comp performance during the first quarter. 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted comps at or above 20%, led by our lumber and kitchen and bath departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.3%, and comp transactions increased 19.1%. Similar to what we reported in our previous 3 quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was driven by elevated project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products and continued inflation in many product categories, including lumber. This was another record-setting quarter for lumber prices. Let me give you an example of what that means for one of our core lumber SKUs. 
At the end of the first quarter last year, a sheet of [ 7 16 ] OSB was approximately $9.55 As we exited the first quarter this year, that same sheet of OSB more than quadrupled in price to $39.76. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 375 basis points during the first quarter. 
Our interconnected retail strategy is resonating with our customers as evidenced by strong growth from both in-store and online transactions, and we are pleased with our ability to meet widespread demand across our selling platforms. As you heard from Craig, sales from our digital channels grew by 27% during the first quarter, which equates to more than 100% growth on a 2-year stack basis. 
Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 50% compared to the first quarter of last year. We saw widespread big-ticket strength across our business, with notable outperformance in lumber, vinyl plank flooring in many of our installation services. 
From a customer standpoint, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. Growth with both customer groups accelerated during the first quarter, with Pro sales growth slightly outpacing DIY. Sales to our Pro customers continue to strengthen, posting the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth and the best quarterly growth rate on record. Pros continue to tell us that project demand is strong and their backlogs are growing. 
Shifting over to our DIY customers. The strong demand we saw during the back half of last year continued during the first quarter. From gardening to garage and organization, new and existing customers are engaging with home improvement. And during the quarter, we were also well positioned for the start of the spring selling season. We took decisive action earlier than usual to proactively lean into our inventory position. This paid off as spring began breaking across the country, and our associates were well equipped to service customers across key outdoor and garden categories. And the strength in gardening was more than just plants and shrubs. We posted a record quarter in categories like planters and hardscapes. 
Additionally, while outdoor categories exhibited significant growth during the first quarter, we've continued to see strong momentum with interior projects around the house. Interior projects like countertops, vanities, blinds and home decor all showed significant growth in the first quarter. 
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are focused on continuing the momentum we are seeing with our customers. We're particularly encouraged with the strong demand we're seeing from our Pro customers. And for our Pros, we know that brands matter. Brands like Milwaukee, Klein and Carlin have significant market share in their respective categories and are trusted by our Pro customers to get the job done. Milwaukee recently expanded their powerful M18 battery platform to include a full line of cordless nailers that deliver pneumatic performance with no compressors, no gas cartridges and rapid fire rates to keep Pros productive. The M18 platform now features over 200 tools that are exclusive to The Home Depot and the big-box home improvement channel. 
And at a time when Pros are busier than ever, we are thrilled that we are the destination for Carlin's PVC electrical boxes and Klein tools. These brands are 2 of the most widely used by electricians. We've enjoyed a long exclusive partnership with Klein being first to market with their new and innovative products, and we are now the exclusive national partner of Carlin in the big-box home improvement channel. And while we don't know how the demand environment will ultimately unfold, as we look forward to the rest of the busy spring season, we feel great about our position and we look forward to serving our customers both in-store and online. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the first quarter, Total sales were $37.5 billion, an increase of $9.2 billion or 32.7% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 31%, with positive comps of 19.8% in Feb",877,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, Total sales were $37.5 billion, an increase of $9.2 billion or 32.7% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 31%, with positive comps of 19.8% in February, 36.2% in March and 34.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 29.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 19.9% in February, 35.6% in March and 32% in April. 
During the first quarter, all 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted strong double-digit comps. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Mix pressure from higher lumber sales alone negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 35 basis points. 
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 390 basis points to 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating leverage during the first quarter as it reflects disciplined expense control, along with a couple of other expense items that I'd like to highlight. 
First, our operating leverage in the first quarter of this year reflects the impact of several onetime expenses that we incurred in the first quarter of 2020, including additional compensation and benefits to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the first quarter of last year, notably payroll, as we worked to staff up labor to meet the surge in demand. Together, the net impact of these factors resulted in approximately 240 basis points of operating expense leverage during the first quarter of 2021. 
Second, during the first quarter of 2021, we incurred approximately $80 million of COVID-related expenses, which created approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. 
And lastly, our operating expense leverage during the first quarter also includes pressure from higher accrued bonus expense primarily related to our outperformance for our store Success Sharing program in store and field-based management bonuses for the first half of fiscal 2021. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 11.6% in the first quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $26 million to $333 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. 
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.86, an increase of 85.6% compared to the first quarter of 2020. 
During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in the U.S. and 1 in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,298. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 239 million square feet. 
At the end of the quarter, inventories were $19.2 billion, up $4.2 billion from last year. And inventory turns were 5.5x, up from 5x last year. 
Turning to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. First and foremost, we will invest in our business. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $525 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And second, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and repurchasing shares. 
During the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Our share repurchases during the first quarter partially reflect an elevated cash balance in 2020 when we paused share repurchases to temporarily increase our liquidity levels as we navigated the pandemic. 
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.1%, up from 40.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Moving to the broader demand environment for home improvement. The strong demand that we've seen for more than a year now has continued. During the first 2 weeks of May, on a 2-year stacked basis, we've seen comps in the U.S. above 30%. Housing remains strong. Homeowners' balance sheets are healthy, and our customers continue to tell us that they are planning on spending on a variety of home improvement projects. 
With that said, we cannot predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact the consumer. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Our relentless focus on the customer and our ability to remain flexible and agile has enabled us to serve our customers and to meet demand in this dynamic environment. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. 
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider. And we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will grow faster than our market, and we will deliver exceptional shareholder value. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

Specific to the results we're getting in terms of the flatbed delivery centers, maybe I'll highlight that. That was really designed to provide store relief, increase our customer satisfaction and service to customers, expand our available assortment and delivery capabilities. And we now have 4 flatbed DCs open now in various stages of ramping. 
Dallas is the furthest along. It's ahead of our plans in terms of the flatbed sales comp, which are very strong and not just in dollars, but also in units and in number of deliveries. Our customer satisfaction has improved by 11 percentage points. We've improved our on time and complete. 
And notably, our Pro penetration is very strong. In fact, the preponderance of sales out of that facility are, in fact, Pro. So really helping us to capture the Pro there in Dallas."

We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. Fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start as we grew the business by over $9 billion compared to the first quarter of last year. Sales for the first quarter w",814,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. Fiscal 2021 is off to a strong start as we grew the business by over $9 billion compared to the first quarter of last year. Sales for the first quarter were $37.5 billion, up 32.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 31% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 29.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.86 in the first quarter, up from $2.08 in the first quarter last year.
Our results this quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and geographies. All of our top 40 markets posted double-digit comps, while Canada posted comps above the company average, and Mexico posted double-digit comps. Both ticket and transactions were up double digits in the quarter. And as Ted will detail, we saw strong double-digit growth from both our Pro and DIY customers.
We continue to effectively manage the outsized demand for home improvement products seen throughout most of last year despite disruptions in global supply chains that were further exasperated by port congestion during the quarter. We leveraged the scale of our supply chain and partnered with our vendors to maintain our in-stock positions and prioritized key SKUs in high-demand categories.
While we continue to see strong level of engagement across our digital platforms, we saw more of our customers return to our stores. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 27% versus the first quarter last year, and approximately 55% of online orders were fulfilled through a store.
We continue to roll out new capabilities, such as mixed-cart selling from store, that remove friction for both our customers and associates. The mixed cart feature enables associates to more efficiently and effectively serve the total project needs for a customer as products from both the website and store can be added to a single transaction. 
We also continue to drive interconnected enhancements in other areas of the business to solve customer pain points. In tool rental, for example, we will soon expand our rent online pilot chain-wide, enabling rent online, pick up in store capabilities for all 1,300-plus tool rental locations in the U.S. and Canada. This will enhance the experience for our busy Pro and DIY customers and complement additional investments we are making to expand our rental footprint and increase our assortment and delivery capabilities.
We are focused on continuing to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience. Our efforts will continue to support what we believe is our winning formula: deliver the best shopping experience in home improvement, extend our position as a low-cost provider with a relentless focus on productivity and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. We believe this strategy will help us deliver returns by driving growth faster than the market in any environment.
The build-out of our One Home Depot supply chain vision is a wonderful example of our strategy in action. Enhanced fulfillment capabilities will not only create a better customer experience, but they will also expand the breadth of our current opportunity set from both a product and customer standpoint. The ability to combine this growth potential with scale to create the low-cost network in home improvement is a formula that we believe delivers long-term value creation for our customers, supplier partners and shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to build out our One Supply Chain vision by opening several new facilities, and we are very excited with the progress we continue to make on this key strategic priority.
We have now been operating in this unprecedented demand environment for over a year and continue to align around a few key learnings: first, the investments we have made in the business over the past decade were the right ones; and second, they have enabled agility and flexibility to execute on critical business decisions in a challenging and dynamic operating environment. As a result, we have managed unprecedented levels of web traffic, record levels of product flow through our supply chain, all while improving customer service levels in our stores. These factors, coupled with our world-class associates and strong partnership with suppliers, have enabled us to meet outsized demand week after week.
Our cultures remain our North Star as their decisions are anchored to some of our most important values: do the right thing and take care of our people. Our ability to continue investing for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company's history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other during these challenging times. With that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities.
We continued to experience unprecedented levels of demand during the first quarter, with comps accelerating to more than 30% when compared to the first quarter of last year. This elevated demand and transportation headwinds are pressuring parts of the supply chain, but our teams continue to work together with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures.
Moving to our comp performance during the first quarter. 13 of our 14 merchandising departments posted comps at or above 20%, led by our lumber and kitchen and bath departments. Our comp average ticket increased 10.3%, and comp transactions increased 19.1%. Similar to what we reported in our previous 3 quarters, the growth in our comp average ticket was driven by elevated project demand, customers trading up to new and innovative products and continued inflation in many product categories, including lumber. This was another record-setting quarter for lumber prices. Let me give you an example of what that means for one of our core lumber SKUs.
At the end of the first quarter last year, a sheet of 7/16 OSB was approximately $9.55 As we exited the first quarter this year, that same sheet of OSB more than quadrupled in price to $39.76. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 375 basis points during the first quarter.
Our interconnected retail strategy is resonating with our customers as evidenced by strong growth from both in-store and online transactions, and we are pleased with our ability to meet widespread demand across our selling platforms. As you heard from Craig, sales from our digital channels grew by 27% during the first quarter, which equates to more than 100% growth on a 2-year stack basis.
Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 50% compared to the first quarter of last year. We saw widespread big-ticket strength across our business, with notable outperformance in lumber, vinyl plank flooring in many of our installation services.
From a customer standpoint, we saw double-digit growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. Growth with both customer groups accelerated during the first quarter, with Pro sales growth slightly outpacing DIY. Sales to our Pro customers continue to strengthen, posting the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth and the best quarterly growth rate on record. Pros continue to tell us that project demand is strong, and their backlogs are growing.
Shifting over to our DIY customers. The strong demand we saw during the back half of last year continued during the first quarter. From gardening to garage and organization, new and existing customers are engaging with home improvement. And during the quarter, we were also well positioned for the start of the spring selling season. We took decisive action earlier than usual to proactively lean into our inventory position. This paid off as spring began breaking across the country, and our associates were well equipped to service customers across key outdoor and garden categories. And the strength in gardening was more than just plants and shrubs. We posted a record quarter in categories like planters and hardscapes.
Additionally, while outdoor categories exhibited significant growth during the first quarter, we've continued to see strong momentum with interior projects around the house. Interior projects like countertops, vanities, blinds and home decor all showed significant growth in the first quarter.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are focused on continuing the momentum we are seeing with our customers. We're particularly encouraged with the strong demand we're seeing from our Pro customers. And for our Pros, we know that brands matter. Brands like Milwaukee, Klein and Carlon have significant market share in their respective categories and are trusted by our Pro customers to get the job done.
Milwaukee recently expanded their powerful M18 battery platform to include a full line of cordless nailers that deliver pneumatic performance with no compressors, no gas cartridges and rapid fire rates to keep Pros productive. The M18 platform now features over 200 tools that are exclusive to The Home Depot and the big-box home improvement channel.
And at a time when Pros are busier than ever, we are thrilled that we are the destination for Carlon's PVC electrical boxes and Klein Tools. These brands are 2 of the most widely used by electricians. We've enjoyed a long exclusive partnership with Klein, being first to market with their new and innovative products, and we are now the exclusive national partner of Carlon in the big-box home improvement channel.
And while we don't know how the demand environment will ultimately unfold, as we look forward to the rest of the busy spring season, we feel great about our position, and we look forward to serving our customers, both in-store and online. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 31%, with positive comps of 19.8% in February, 36.2% in March and 34.3% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 29.9% for the quarter, with positive comps of 19.9% in February, 35.6% in March and 32% in April. During the first quarter, all 19 of our U.S. regions as well as Canada and Mexico posted strong double-digit comps.
In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year. Mix pressure from higher lumber sales alone negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 35 basis points.
During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 390 basis points to 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating leverage during the first quarter as it reflects disciplined expense control, along with a couple of other expense items that I'd like to highlight.
First, our operating leverage in the first quarter of this year reflects the impact of several onetime expenses that we incurred in the first quarter of 2020, including additional compensation and benefits to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the first quarter of last year, notably payroll, as we worked to staff up labor to meet the surge in demand. Together, the net impact of these factors resulted in approximately 240 basis points of operating expense leverage during the first quarter of 2021.
Second, during the first quarter of 2021, we incurred approximately $80 million of COVID-related expenses, which created approximately 20 basis points of operating expense deleverage. And lastly, our operating expense leverage during the first quarter also includes pressure from higher accrued bonus expense primarily related to our outperformance for our store Success Sharing program in store and field-based management bonuses for the first half of fiscal 2021.
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.4% compared to 11.6% in the first quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $26 million to $333 million, due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.
In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.86, an increase of 85.6% compared to the first quarter of 2020.
During the quarter, we opened 1 new store in the U.S. and 1 in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,298. Selling square footage at the end of the quarter was 239 million square feet.
At the end of the quarter, inventories were $19.2 billion, up $4.2 billion from last year. And inventory turns were 5.5x, up from 5x last year.
Turning to capital allocation. Our long-term principles for how we think about deploying capital have not changed. First and foremost, we will invest in our business. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $525 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And second, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and repurchasing shares. During the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Our share repurchases during the first quarter partially reflect an elevated cash balance in 2020 when we paused share repurchases to temporarily increase our liquidity levels as we navigated the pandemic. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.1%, up from 40.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Moving to the broader demand environment for home improvement. The strong demand that we've seen for more than a year now has continued. During the first 2 weeks of May, on a 2-year stacked basis, we've seen comps in the U.S. above 30%. Housing remains strong. Homeowners' balance sheets are healthy, and our customers continue to tell us that they are planning on spending on a variety of home improvement projects.
With that said, we cannot predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact the consumer. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Our relentless focus on the customer and our ability to remain flexible and agile has enabled us to serve our customers and to meet demand in this dynamic environment.
Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider. And we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will grow faster than our market, and we will deliver exceptional shareholder value.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions."

Overall, on what's accelerating, I would say continued outdoor living has been very strong. So if all of you are interested in things like grills and patio sets, those are going to be in shorter supply as we get into the spring because the demand is incredibly strong. And in things like patio, we do a fixed buy as most of that is import, and we had to make the decision on the buy level quite some time ago. So that's been particularly strong."

We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales f",801,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.
We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales for the second quarter were $41.1 billion, up 8.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.5% from last year with U.S. comps of a positive 3.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.53 in the second quarter, up from $4.02 in the second quarter last year.
The strong underlying demand across the business continues. During the second quarter, we did observe some changing consumer patterns in the U.S. as the U.S. economy opened up. This has manifested itself in several ways.
We have seen a shift in pattern of sales within the week as our weekday sales performance has actually strengthened relative to the weekend. We attributed this to consumers returning to travel and other recreational activities. And while the consumers return to pre-pandemic activities, we continue to see them engage in home improvement projects. We also see customers more comfortable taking on larger projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which outpaced the DIY customer for the second quarter in a row.
We remained agile and flexible, and we're pleased with our ability to respond to strong home improvement demand and comp to comp in the second quarter. We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented comparisons last year and grew sales by $3.1 billion in the second quarter and more than $12 billion year-to-date. Over the last 6 quarters, we have grown the business by more than $34 billion, a level unmatched in our market.
From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year. On a 2-year stack basis, all 19 regions saw strong double-digit comp growth. However, unlike the past 4 quarters, the second quarter, we did experience some variability in performance from a geographic perspective. The variability in our regional performance is driven by our Northern division, where we saw a more pronounced shift in sales with stronger sales in outdoor seasonal categories during the first quarter.
Mexico posted double-digit positive comps. And despite significant customer restrictions during the quarter due to COVID-19, Canada posted comps that were essentially flat in local currency.
We continue to effectively manage the strong demand for home improvement products despite significant industry disruptions in supply chains. We are leveraging the scale of our supply chain and partnership with our vendors to prioritize key SKUs in high-demand categories. And while our in-stocks are not where we want them to be, they have improved from where they were a year ago, and our network continues to flow goods remarkably well, thanks to the investments we have made in our supply chain over a number of years.
The team continues to make progress on building out our One Home Depot supply chain vision. We remain largely on track with our plans with the critical mass of buildings scheduled to come online this year and next. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the breadth and depth of our current opportunity set, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement.
In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals: to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value.
Throughout all the events of the past 18 months, our cultures remain our North Star. In fact, I recently spent time with a number of new associates that we have hired in the past year and was struck by how engaged and connected these associates were to The Home Depot culture. They were onboarded during a time when our stores and teams were busier than ever. But our associates took the time to get to know these new folks and share what it means to be part of the Orange-Blooded family. Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts.
I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities.
As you heard from Craig, during the second quarter, we continue to see strong performance in our business, particularly as we lap the significant growth from the same period last year. We were able to meet strong customer demand despite ongoing pressures throughout the supply chain. Raw material shortages, production constraints and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult supply chain environment.
That being said, our performance would not be possible without the cross-functional efforts by our supply chain, merchandising, store and met teams as we continue to flow record volumes of goods week after week.
Over the course of the pandemic, you've heard us talk about a number of initiatives we've implemented, many in concert with our suppliers to improve our in-stock positions and get product to our customers. And our teams continue to use our culture and values to guide our decisions.
One of our values is entrepreneurial spirit, which is alive and well at The Home Depot. Our supply chain teams recently leveraged our scale and flexibility to arrange for several container vessels for exclusive use, yet another way our teams found a creative solution to better serve our customers in this dynamic environment.
While our in-stock levels are still not where we want them to be, we are maintaining the improvements we made over the last few quarters in building depth in key categories as evidenced by inventory growing faster than sales compared to the same period last year.
Turning to our comp performance. During the second quarter, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by kitchen and bath and lumber. During the second quarter of this year, we saw single-digit negative comps in paint, hardware and indoor and outdoor garden. It is important to note that these were some of our strongest-performing departments during the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit comps.
Our comp average ticket increased 11.3%, and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation in certain categories, notably lumber. On a 2-year stack basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. This was another historic quarter for lumber price volatility. During the first few weeks of the second quarter, prices for both framing and panel lumber reached all-time highs before quickly falling from their peaks.
As an example, during the second quarter, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,500 per 1,000 board feet before falling over $1,000 to approximately $500. While pricing for both framing and panel has come down from the peaks, the average price during the second quarter was still significantly higher than the same period last year.
Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 420 basis points during the second quarter. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like lumber, vinyl plank flooring, gypsum and pipe and fittings.
During the second quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth for the second quarter in a row. On a 2-year stack basis, growth with our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong.
We're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros. Growth with our larger Pros continues to outpace that of our smaller Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are long and growing. In fact, the National Association of Homebuilders Remodeling Index hit all-time highs during the second quarter. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the strength of several of our kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and vanities, all of which posted 1-year and 2-year comps above the company average.
Sales leveraging our digital platforms were essentially flat during the second quarter as we lap digital sales growth of approximately 100% in the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, sales from our digital platforms increased approximately 100%.
We're thrilled with the customer engagement across our interconnected platforms. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner, whether it be through project inspiration and research, transacting, fulfillment or support, our customers blend the physical and digital worlds. And while customers have gotten more comfortable buying online, we've never been more confident in the importance of our physical stores as that they remain the center of our customer experience due to the project nature of our business.
For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 55% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy.
As we look forward to the back half of the year, we know our Pros are busy and we are working hard to secure the best products to help our Pros get their jobs done. Last quarter, we highlighted several exclusive products for our Pro customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce a new big-box home improvement exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions, a top provider of OSB panel boards.
In addition, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our Pro Extra loyalty program. Several quarters ago, we relaunched Pro Extra, and we've been thrilled with the membership take-up and engagement we are seeing. Pro Extra offers more frequent touch points with our Pros and convenient services like purchase tracking and volume pricing along with other benefits. In addition, all Pro Extra members are now able to access our B2B Pro online experience, offering Pros more personalization on homedepot.com.
During the third quarter, we are also thrilled to announce the rollout of what we believe is the most innovative paint offering in years through our exclusive relationship with Behr. BEHR DYNASTY is a brand-new 4-in-1 interior paint that offers DIY-ers, Pro painters and design professionals a unique product exclusively from the Home Depot. It is our most stain-repellent, scuff-resistant, fast-growing 1-coat coverage paint, all in one can.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the second quarter, total sales were $41.1 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion or 8.1% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $385 million.
During the second quarter, our total company comps were positive 4.5%, with positive comps in all 3 months. During the quarter, we saw total company comps of 4.7% in May, 3.9% in June and 4.9% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.4% for the quarter with comps of 3.1% in May, 2.7% in June and 4.3% in July.
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, the year-over-year change during the second quarter was primarily driven by lumber, which accounted for approximately 60 basis points of pressure. In addition, several other factors negatively impacted our gross margin, including rising transportation costs, One Supply Chain investments and lapping a benefit from canceled events in the second quarter of last year.
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 100 basis points to 17.1%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the second quarter of 2020 to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the second quarter of last year, most notably payroll, as we staffed up to meet strong demand. Our operating expenses during the second quarter of this year also include wage investments that we made at the end of 2020.
Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the second quarter decreased by $16 million to $321 million. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.53, an increase of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $18.9 billion, up $5.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.7x compared with 6.1x this time last year.
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $520 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.75 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 44.7%, up from 41.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
As you heard from Craig, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. And while these challenging compares continue through the back half of the year, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. During the first 2 weeks of August, we've seen comps in the U.S. consistent with the second quarter. Customer engagement and demand for home improvement is healthy. Housing remains strong, and we see a supportive environment for home improvement spending as we look out over the next several years.
That said, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty in the broader environment as it relates to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new and spreading variants. As we've previously shared, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact consumer spending. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market, and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions."

In addition, it's allowing us to expand our assortments from what we carry in our stores. So not only can we get the product in a quicker, more reliable fashion to our customers, we can get a broader assortment to our customers.
And lastly, we're up to $660 a square foot of sales this past quarter in our stores. And it's just a tremendous amount of activity in cube in that building. So to be able to get deliveries, particularly the big and bulky deliveries out of the store, that helps our customer flow and our associate activities in the store. And we're just thrilled with that.

And we have actually seen intent tick up for small projects, medium-sized projects and large projects really serve sequentially through the year.
So I think if you kind of take the question off of the backlog and you say, what's the intent, it does seem like that homeowners are leaning into projects. And whether it's a Pro or consumer customer, it all eventually is the same customer demand. So it looks like the trend is strengthening in project demand."

So we're not alarmed by that falloff at all. We'll get through that.
I'd say that -- take a category like paint. I mean paint had been a 1- or 2-unit grower for several years up until the pandemic. And painting is one of the initial home improvement projects that a customer engages in and starts to build confidence in home improvement. And while we saw a dip in Q2, the levels in unit volume that we're seeing in paint is well above 2019. And I've talked about the millennials before, and the millennials are engaged in housing. They're engaging in home improvement. They've done that first project, which is painting and some gardening work generally. So we're just thrilled that they're engaged in the category and moving on to bigger projects."

278679,1675984005,2380031,"The Home Depot, Inc., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2021",2021-08-17,"Earnings Calls","The Home Depot, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales fo",802,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales for the second quarter were $41.1 billion, up 8.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.5% from last year with U.S. comps of a positive 3.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.53 in the second quarter, up from $4.02 in the second quarter last year. 
The strong underlying demand across the business continues. During the second quarter, we did observe some changing consumer patterns in the U.S. as the U.S. economy opened up. This has manifested itself in several ways. 
We have seen a shift in pattern of sales within the week as our weekday sales performance has actually strengthened relative to the weekend. We attributed this to consumers returning to travel and other recreational activities. And while the consumers return to pre-pandemic activities, we continue to see them engage in home improvement projects. We also see customers more comfortable taking on larger projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which outpaced the DIY customer for the second quarter in a row. 
We remained agile and flexible, and we're pleased with our ability to respond to strong home improvement demand and comp to comp in the second quarter. We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented compares last year and grew sales by $3.1 billion in the second quarter and more than $12 billion year-to-date. Over the last 6 quarters, we have grown the business by more than $34 billion, a level unmatched in our market. 
From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year. On a 2-year stack basis, all 19 regions saw strong double-digit comp growth. However, unlike the past 4 quarters, in the second quarter, we did experience some variability in performance from a geographic perspective. The variability in our regional performance is driven by our Northern division, where we saw a more pronounced shift in sales with stronger sales in outdoor seasonal categories during the first quarter. Mexico posted double-digit positive comps. And despite significant customer restrictions during the quarter due to COVID-19, Canada posted comps that were essentially flat in local currency. 
We continue to effectively manage the strong demand for home improvement products despite significant industry disruptions in supply chains. We are leveraging the scale of our supply chain and partnership with our vendors to prioritize key SKUs in high-demand categories. And while our in-stocks are not where we want them to be, they have improved from where they were a year ago, and our network continues to flow goods remarkably well, thanks to the investments we have made in our supply chain over a number of years. 
The team continues to make progress on building out our One Home Depot supply chain vision. We remain largely on track with our plans with the critical mass of buildings scheduled to come online this year and next. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the breadth and depth of our current opportunity set, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement. 
In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals: to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value. 
Throughout all the events of the past 18 months, our cultures remain our North Star. In fact, I recently spent time with a number of new associates that we have hired in the past year and was struck by how engaged and connected these associates were to The Home Depot culture. They were onboarded during a time when our stores and teams were busier than ever. But our associates took the time to get to know these new folks and share what it means to be part of the Orange-Blooded family. Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. 
I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Craig, during the second quarter, we continue to see",1075,"Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. 
As you heard from Craig, during the second quarter, we continue to see strong performance in our business, particularly as we lap the significant growth from the same period last year. We were able to meet strong customer demand despite ongoing pressures throughout the supply chain. Raw material shortages, production constraints and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult supply chain environment. That being said, our performance would not be possible without the cross-functional efforts by our supply chain, merchandising, store and MET teams as we continue to flow record volumes of goods week after week. 
Over the course of the pandemic, you've heard us talk about a number of initiatives we've implemented, many in concert with our suppliers to improve our in-stock positions and get product to our customers. And our teams continue to use our culture and values to guide our decisions. 
One of our values is entrepreneurial spirit, which is alive and well at The Home Depot. Our supply chain teams recently leveraged our scale and flexibility to arrange for several container vessels for exclusive use, yet another way our teams found a creative solution to better serve our customers in this dynamic environment. 
While our in-stock levels are still not where we want them to be, we are maintaining the improvements we made over the last few quarters in building depth in key categories as evidenced by inventory growing faster than sales compared to the same period last year. 
Turning to our comp performance. During the second quarter, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by kitchen and bath and lumber. During the second quarter of this year, we saw single-digit negative comps in paint, hardware and indoor and outdoor garden. It is important to note that these were some of our strongest-performing departments during the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit comps. Our comp average ticket increased 11.3% and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation in certain categories, notably lumber. On a 2-year stack basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. 
This was another historic quarter for lumber price volatility. During the first few weeks of the second quarter, prices for both framing and panel lumber reached all-time highs before quickly falling from their peaks. As an example, during the second quarter, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,500 per 1,000 board feet before falling over $1,000 to approximately $500. While pricing for both framing and panel has come down from the peaks, the average price during the second quarter was still significantly higher than the same period last year. 
Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 420 basis points during the second quarter. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like lumber, vinyl plank flooring, gypsum and pipe and fittings. 
During the second quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth for the second quarter in a row. On a 2-year stack basis, growth with our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros. Growth with our larger Pros continues to outpace that of our smaller Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are long and growing. In fact, the National Association of Home Builders' Remodeling Index hit all-time highs during the second quarter. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the strength of several of our kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and vanities, all of which posted 1-year and 2-year comps above the company average. 
Sales leveraging our digital platforms were essentially flat during the second quarter as we lap digital sales growth of approximately 100% in the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, sales from our digital platforms increased approximately 100%. 
We're thrilled with the customer engagement across our interconnected platforms. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner, whether it be through project inspiration and research, transacting, fulfillment or support, our customers blend the physical and digital worlds. And while customers have gotten more comfortable buying online, we've never been more confident in the importance of our physical stores as they remain the center of our customer experience due to the project nature of our business. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 55% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. 
As we look forward to the back half of the year, we know our Pros are busy and we are working hard to secure the best products to help our Pros get their jobs done. Last quarter, we highlighted several exclusive products for our Pro customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce a new big-box home improvement exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions, a top provider of OSB panel boards. 
In addition, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our Pro Extra loyalty program. Several quarters ago, we relaunched Pro Extra, and we've been thrilled with the membership take-up and engagement we are seeing. Pro Extra offers more frequent touch points with our Pros and convenient services like purchase tracking and volume pricing along with other benefits. In addition, all Pro Extra members are now able to access our B2B Pro online experience, offering Pros more personalization on homedepot.com. 
During the third quarter, we are also thrilled to announce the rollout of what we believe is the most innovative paint offering in years through our exclusive relationship with Behr. BEHR DYNASTY is a brand-new 4-in-1 interior paint that offers DIY-ers, Pro painters and design professionals a unique product exclusively from The Home Depot. It is our most stain-repellent, scuff-resistant, fast-growing 1-coat coverage paint, all in one can. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

During th",763,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $41.1 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion or 8.1% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $385 million. 
During the second quarter, our total company comps were positive 4.5%, with positive comps in all 3 months. During the quarter, we saw total company comps of 4.7% in May, 3.9% in June and 4.9% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 3.4% for the quarter with comps of 3.1% in May, 2.7% in June and 4.3% in July. 
In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 80 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, the year-over-year change during the second quarter was primarily driven by lumber, which accounted for approximately 60 basis points of pressure. In addition, several other factors negatively impacted our gross margin, including rising transportation costs, One Supply Chain investments and lapping a benefit from canceled events in the second quarter of last year. 
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 100 basis points to 17.1%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the second quarter of 2020 to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the second quarter of last year, most notably payroll, as we staffed up to meet strong demand. Our operating expenses during the second quarter of this year also include wage investments that we made at the end of 2020. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the second quarter decreased by $16 million to $321 million. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.53, an increase of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, inventories were $18.9 billion, up $5.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.7x compared with 6.1x this time last year. 
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $520 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.75 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 44.7%, up from 41.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. 
As you heard from Craig, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. And while these challenging compares continue through the back half of the year, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. During the first 2 weeks of August, we've seen comps in the U.S. consistent with the second quarter. Customer engagement and demand for home improvement is healthy. Housing remains strong, and we see a supportive environment for home improvement spending as we look out over the next several years. 
That said, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty in the broader environment as it relates to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new and spreading variants. As we've previously shared, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact consumer spending. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. 
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions."

I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the third quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $36.8 billion, up 9.8% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 5.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.92 in the third quarter, up from $3.18 in the third quarter last year. 
Home improvement demand remains strong. Our customers remain engaged with projects around the home, and we continue to focus on delivering the best experience in retail. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see customers taking on larger home improvement projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which once again outpaced the DIY customer. 
As been the case for the last 18 months, the team is doing an outstanding job of navigating a fluid and challenging operating environment. Ultimately, this is what has allowed us to respond to the strong home improvement demand that has persisted. We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented compares last year and grew sales by $3.3 billion in the third quarter, bringing total sales growth year-to-date to more than $15.5 billion through the third quarter. 
From a geographic perspective, all of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year, and both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps. These results were driven by our associates who have maintained a relentless focus on our customers, while simultaneously managing industry-wide supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market. 
While these factors present challenges for retail as a whole, we will use our experience, tools and our scale to manage through this environment with the intent to deliver a strong value proposition to our customers. We are thankful for the tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners. Our respective teams have worked tirelessly to build depth in key product categories and to flow products to our stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to thank them for their ongoing efforts as we continue to navigate one of the most challenging environments we have ever faced. 
Beyond the current environment, we are focused on positioning ourselves for growth. We are investing in stores to drive further productivity, which Ted will discuss. We are enhancing the interconnected shopping experience by investing to remove friction for our customers wherever possible. And the build-out of our supply chain vision continues to progress, and we remain on track with our plans. We are encouraged by the results that we're seeing from buildings that we have stood up as we optimize and assort these facilities to unlock their full potential. 
We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the opportunity to capture wallet share gains with both new and existing customers, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement. 
In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider and home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value. 
Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company's history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. I want to thank all of our associates for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers and communities. 
In conjunction with Veterans Day last week, the Home Depot Foundation announced that it has now surpassed $400 million invested in support of U.S. military veterans since 2011. This brings us closer to achieving our goal to invest $0.5 billion in veteran causes by 2025. We honor and support our military veterans and families, and we thank them for their service to our country. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We had a great third quarter. I want to start by thanking all our associates as well as their supplier and transportation partners for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and communities in what remains a very challenging operating environment. 
There is no question that pressures on global supply chains increased over the last 18 months. That being said, we could not be more pleased with how our cross-functional teams responded. The teams took a number of decisive actions to secure more product for our customers while continuing to find new and different ways to flow that product. 
Beginning in the second quarter of last year, our merchant inventory and supply chain teams leverage tools and analytics and work with our vendor partners to adjust our assortments, and in some cases, introduce alternative products. The teams also built depth in job lot quantities and high-demand products. We improved our in-stock levels in the back half of last year, and we've been able to sustain, and in some cases, improve our levels even as home improvement demand remains elevated. 
In addition to the challenging supply chain environment, we are also seeing rising cost pressures across several different product categories. Our seasoned teams of merchandising, finance and data analytics associates are working with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures. We have effectively managed inflationary environments in the past, and we feel good about our ability to continue managing through the current environment while being our customers' advocate for value. 
Turning to our comp performance during the third quarter, 12 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, plumbing, electrical, building materials, tools, kitchen and bath, to corn storage and work and flooring had comps above the company average. Paint, outdoor garden and hardware were positive but below the company average. Indoor garden was essentially flat and lumber posted a high single-digit negative comp compared with lumber comps of more than 50% in the third quarter of 2020. On a 2-year basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit positive comps. 
Our comp average ticket increased 12.7% and comp transactions decreased 5.8%. Growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation across several product categories. Our commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 70 basis points in the third quarter driven by inflation in copper and building materials, which was partially offset by deflation in lumber. 
On a 2-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 18% compared to the third quarter of last year. During the third quarter, Pro sales growth continue to outpace DIY growth. On a 2-year comp basis, growth of both our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. 
Similar to the second quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros for help with larger projects. We see this in the strength of several Pro-heavy categories like drywall, pneumatics, pipe and fittings and several millwork categories. We remain encouraged by what we are hearing from our Pros as they tell us their backlogs are healthy. 
Sales leveraging our digital platforms grew approximately 8% for the third quarter, which brings our digital 2-year growth to approximately 95%. Our customers continue to shop with us in an interconnected manner as approximately 55% of our online orders are fulfilled through our stores. 
While we navigate these challenging environment, we continue to invest in our business to enhance the customer shopping experience while also driving productivity and efficiency. We believe we have a significant opportunity to further optimize space productivity in our stores by balancing the art and science of retail. This is a continuous process that we believe leads to better, more productive assortments and space allocations, which ultimately drives value for our customers. 
Let me take a moment to comment on some unique capabilities we've built that showcase what I mean. More than a year ago, we started to test in some of our higher-volume stores. The idea was, how can we further drive space productivity improve the shopping experience at the same time. Our cross-functional teams applied a combination of space optimization models in conjunction with the expertise of our local field merchants, many of whom have more than 30 years of tenure with The Home Depot to create store-specific outcomes that adjust assortments and improved space utilization. 
The results exceeded our expectations. Sales per square foot improved, on-shelf availability improved, Voice of the Customer scores improved, labor utilization improved. And during the process, we were able to add net new base to the stores. As a result, we went from a small test to now targeting more than 400 stores this year with more in the pipeline for next year. I want to recognize all the teams helping drive this success. 
As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season. During the third quarter, we hosted our Halloween event and cannot be happier with the results. We saw record sales and sell-through as customers responded to our exclusive product offerings and innovative approach to the category. 
During the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. Like last year, we extended these events to cover a longer period and not just focus on 1 day. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

In the third quarter, total sales were $36.8 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion or 9.8% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $190 million. 
During the third quarter, our total company comps were positive 6.1% with positive comps in all 3 months. We saw total company comps of 3.1% in August, 4.5% in September and 9.9% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 5.5% for the quarter with comps of 2.2% in August, 4% in September and 9.6% in October. 
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of approximately 5 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, during the third quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher transportation costs and mix of products sold which was partially offset by higher retail prices. 
During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 130 basis points to 18.4%. Our operating leverage during the third quarter reflects the lapping of significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the third quarter of 2020 to support our associates as well as payroll leverage. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 15.7%, an increase of approximately 125 basis points from the third quarter of 2020. 
Interest and other expense for the third quarter was essentially flat with the same period last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5%, up from 24.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.92, an increase of 23.3% compared to the third quarter of 2020. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $20.6 billion, up $4.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.4x compared with 5.9x this time last year. 
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we plan to continue investing in our business with CapEx of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. 
We also plan to maintain flexibility to move faster or slower depending on the environment. A good illustration of this is what you heard from Ted. We built capabilities to drive productivity across some of our higher-volume stores. We tested them. We saw strong results across key performance metrics and we moved quickly to expand the investment. 
During the third quarter, we invested approximately $700 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures bringing year-to-date capital expenditures to approximately $1.7 billion. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. 
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.9%, up from 41.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 
As you have heard from Craig, we're very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the third quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. Customer engagement remains strong and demand for home improvement is healthy. We've been pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenging environment. However, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment and cost pressures will evolve and how they will ultimately impact consumer spending. 
As we've mentioned on previous calls, our teams are managing our business on a relatively short cycle, and we will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance to date. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. 
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider. And we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market, and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions."

Michael, I would say from a gross margin perspective, there was very little net impact from product cost pressures. So as Richard said, we don't look at things necessarily on a unit-to-unit basis, but our merchants are well versed with running their portfolios. And while we have certainly seen non-commodity cost impacts, those have largely been offset by increases overall in the retail portfolio. 
Our cost pressures -- margin pressures that we've seen in the past have been more related to our supply chain build-out, delivered sales, mix of product sales. We've talked about the appliance business in the past as an example, which is an incredibly productive high-growth business with extremely high GMROI because of our inventory position, but not necessarily the highest gross margin category. 
If you look at our ticket growth, certainly, there's an AUR -- significant AUR double-digit growth. Certainly, a essentially half of that is from product costs that we have passed on. But it's important to note that our Pro and consumer customers remain incredibly engaged in this category and innovation and newness still sells in this marketplace. And the equal amount of our AUR was driven by mix and new product innovation. So think of things like appliances, the technological features and benefits that have been introduced into appliances, grills and pellet grill smokers, our outdoor power equipment and power tools with our battery platforms. 
We just launched a new exclusive paint from Behr and DYNASTY. This is the best paint that Home Depot has ever introduced. It's over $50 a gallon on shelf. It's performing incredibly well as customers trade up to the innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So yes, there's cost pressures that the merchants have offset, but equally doing a terrific job finding new and innovative product that our customers are engaging in."

I think lumber was the best example, as Craig just alluded to, when lumber prices were 3 and 4x the near-term levels, we clearly saw units drop off, which then leads to project dropping off across the store as lumber prices came down. And as we sit today, for example, framing is up only about 5% on last year and panel is slightly below last year. And if you look back at the end of the second quarter, those prices were up significantly over prior years. 
Framing it had peaked out at roughly $1,500 and we're down at about $575. So lumber, clearly, a commodity very representative of elasticities across the rest of the business. We haven't seen specific falloffs in categories because of overly robust, if you will, cost moves. Watching it carefully, but so far, have not seen it."

But there is still product, and we have 95-odd ships in total parked outside L.A. Long Beach, and we track our containers on those ships and also getting onto the ports and off the port.

We're pleased with year-to-date. There's always going to be fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. If you think about Q3 flow-through, there are really 3 significant dynamics. The first is that we're anniversary-ing significant COVID-related compensation and benefits from last year. But recall that we reinvested a good bit of that in the form of permanent wage increases at the end of last year. 
The second dynamic is just the comparison between ticket and transaction comp. When ticket comp is higher than transaction because our payroll model is activity-based, you're going to see more leverage than when you see in the converse when transaction outpaces ticket. So we saw a leverage benefit there. And then finally, to a much lesser degree, as Craig said, we've hired a lot of people this year and feel great about how our stores are operating. We -- at the same time, probably could have seen staffing a little higher if we had, had our preference. And we'll continue to work on that."

I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the third quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $36.8 billion, up 9.8% from last year. Comp sales were up 6.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 5.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.92 in the third quarter, up from $3.18 in the third quarter last year.  
Home improvement demand remains strong. Our customers remained engaged with projects around the home, and we continue to focus on delivering the best experience in retail. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see customers taking on larger home improvement projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which once again outpaced the DIY customer.
As been the case for the last 18 months, the team is doing an outstanding job of navigating a fluid and challenging operating environment. Ultimately, this is what has allowed us to respond to the strong home improvement demand that has persisted. We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented [ compares ] last year and grew sales by $3.3 billion in the third quarter, bringing total sales growth year-to-date to more than $15.5 billion through the third quarter.  
From a geographic perspective, all of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year, and both Canada and Mexico posted positive comps. These results were driven by our associates who have maintained a relentless focus on our customers, while simultaneously managing industry-wide supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market.
While these factors present challenges for retail as a whole, we will use our experience, tools and our scale to manage through this environment with the intent to deliver a strong value proposition to our customers. We are thankful for the tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners. Our respective teams have worked tirelessly to build depth in key product categories and to flow products to our stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to thank them for their ongoing efforts as we continue to navigate one of the most challenging environments we have ever faced.
Beyond the current environment, we are focused on positioning ourselves for growth. We are investing in stores to drive further productivity, which Ted will discuss. We are enhancing the interconnected shopping experience by investing to remove friction for our customers wherever possible. And the build-out of our supply chain vision continues to progress, and we remain on track with our plans. We are encouraged by the results that we're seeing from buildings that we have stood up as we optimize and assort these facilities to unlock their full potential.
We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the opportunity to capture wallet share gains with both new and existing customers, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement.  
In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider and home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency and deliver exceptional shareholder value.  
Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company's history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. I want to thank all of our associates for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers and communities.  
In conjunction with Veterans Day last week, the Home Depot Foundation announced that it has now surpassed $400 million invested in support of U.S. military veterans since 2011. This brings us closer to achieving our goal to invest $0.5 billion in veteran causes by 2025. We honor and support our military veterans and families, and we thank them for their service to our country.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

We had a great third quarter.

We had a great third quarter. I want to start by thanking all our associates as well as our supplier and transportation partners for their unwavering commitment to serving our customers and communities in what remains a very challenging operating environment.
There is no question that pressures on global supply chains increased over the last 18 months. That being said, we could not be more pleased with how our cross-functional teams responded. The teams took a number of decisive actions to secure more product for our customers while continuing to find new and different ways to flow that product.  
Beginning in the second quarter of last year, our merchant inventory and supply chain teams leveraged tools and analytics and work with our vendor partners to adjust our assortments, and in some cases, introduced alternative products. The teams also built depth in job lot quantities and high-demand products. We improved our in-stock levels in the back half of last year, and we've been able to sustain, and in some cases, improve our levels, even as home improvement demand remains elevated.  
In addition to the challenging supply chain environment, we are also seeing rising cost pressures across several different product categories. Our seasoned teams of merchandising, finance and data analytics associates are working with our supplier partners to manage through these pressures. We have effectively managed inflationary environments in the past, and we feel good about our ability to continue managing through the current environment while being our customers' advocate for value.  
Turning to our comp performance during the third quarter, 12 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, plumbing, electrical, building materials, tools, kitchen and bath, decor and storage, millwork and flooring had comps above the company average. 
Paint, outdoor garden and hardware were positive but below the company average. Indoor garden was essentially flat and lumber posted a high single-digit negative comp compared with lumber comps of more than 50% in the third quarter of 2020. On a 2-year basis, each of our departments posted healthy double digit positive comps.  
Our comp average ticket increased 12.7% and comp transactions decreased 5.8%. Growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation across several product categories. Our commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 70 basis points in the third quarter driven by inflation in copper and building materials, which was partially offset by deflation in lumber. 
On a 2-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 18% compared to the third quarter of last year. During the third quarter, Pro sales growth continue to outpace DIY growth. On a 2-year comp basis, growth of both our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong.  
Similar to the second quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros for help with larger projects. We see this in the strength of several Pro-heavy categories like drywall, pneumatics,  pipe and fittings and several millwork categories. We remain encouraged by what we are hearing from our Pros as they tell us their backlogs are healthy.  
Sales leveraging our digital platforms grew approximately 8% for the third quarter, which brings our digital 2-year growth to approximately 95%. Our customers continue to shop with us in an interconnected manner as approximately 55% of our online orders are fulfilled through our stores.  
While we navigate these challenging environment, we continue to invest in our business to enhance the customer shopping experience while also driving productivity and efficiency. We believe we have a significant opportunity to further optimize space productivity in our stores by balancing the art and science of retail. This is a continuous process that we believe leads to better, more productive assortments and space allocations, which ultimately drives value for our customers.  
Let me take a moment to comment on some unique capabilities we've built that showcase what I mean. More than a year ago, we started to test in some of our higher-volume stores. The idea was, how can we further drive space productivity and improve the shopping experience at the same time. Our cross-functional teams applied a combination of space optimization models in conjunction with the expertise of our local field merchants, many of whom have more than 30 years of tenure with The Home Depot to create store-specific outcomes that adjust assortments and improved space utilization.  
The results exceeded our expectations. Sales per square foot improved, on-shelf availability improved, Voice of the Customer scores improved, labor utilization improved. And during the process, we were able to add net new base to the stores. As a result, we went from a small test to now targeting more than 400 stores this year with more in the pipeline for next year. I want to recognize all the teams helping drive this success.
As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the upcoming holiday season. During the third quarter, we hosted our Halloween event and cannot be happier with the results. We saw record sales and sell-through as customers responded to our exclusive product offerings and innovative approach to the category.
During the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. Like last year, we extended these events to cover a longer period and not just focus on one day.  
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

During t",727,"Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone.  In the third quarter, total sales were $36.8 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion or 9.8% from last year. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $190 million.  
During the third quarter, our total company comps were positive 6.1% with positive comps in all 3 months. We saw total company comps of 3.1% in August, 4.5% in September and 9.9% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 5.5% for the quarter with comps of 2.2% in August, 4% in September and 9.6% in October.
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, a decrease of approximately 5 basis points from the same period last year. While there are many factors that impact gross margin, during the third quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by higher transportation costs and mix of products sold, which was partially offset by higher retail prices.  
During the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 130 basis points to 18.4%. Our operating leverage during the third quarter reflects the lapping of significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the third quarter of 2020 to support our associates, as well as payroll leverage. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 15.7%, an increase of approximately 125 basis points from the third quarter of 2020.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter was essentially flat with the same period last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5%, up from 24.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $3.92, an increase of 23.3% compared to the third quarter of 2020. At the end of the quarter, inventories were $20.6 billion, up $4.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.4x compared with 5.9x this time last year.
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we plan to continue investing in our business with CapEx of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis.
We also plan to maintain flexibility to move faster or slower depending on the environment. A good illustration of this is what you heard from Ted. We built capabilities to drive productivity across some of our higher-volume stores, we tested them, we saw strong results across key performance metrics, and we moved quickly to expand the investment.  
During the third quarter, we invested approximately $700 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures bringing year-to-date capital expenditures to approximately $1.7 billion. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.9%, up from 41.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
As you have heard from Craig, we're very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the third quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. Customer engagement remains strong and demand for home improvement is healthy. We've been pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenging environment. However, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment and cost pressures will evolve and how they will ultimately impact consumer spending.  
As we've mentioned on previous calls, our teams are managing our business on a relatively short cycle, and we will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance to date. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider. And we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market, and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders.  
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions."

Michael, I would say from a gross margin perspective, there was very little net impact from product cost pressures. So as Richard said, we don't look at things necessarily on a unit-to-unit basis, but our merchants are well versed with running their portfolios. And while we have certainly seen non-commodity cost impacts, those have largely been offset by increases overall in the retail portfolio.  
Our cost pressures -- margin pressures that we've seen in the past have been more related to our supply chain build-out, delivered sales, mix of product sales, we've talked about the appliance business in the past as an example, which is an incredibly productive high-growth business with extremely high GMROI because of our inventory position, but not necessarily the highest gross margin category.  
If you look at our ticket growth, certainly, there's an AUR -- significant AUR double digit growth. Certainly a -- essentially half of that is from product costs that we have passed on. But it's important to note that our Pro and consumer customers remain incredibly engaged in this category and innovation and newness still sells in this marketplace. And the equal amount of our AUR was driven by mix and new product innovation. So think of things like appliances, the technological features and benefits that have been introduced into appliances, grills and pellet grill smokers, our outdoor power equipment and power tools with our battery platforms.  
We just launched a new exclusive paint from Behr and DYNASTY. This is the best paint that Home Depot has ever introduced. It's over $50 a gallon on shelf. It's performing incredibly well as customers trade up to the innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So yes, there's cost pressures that the merchants have offset, but equally doing a terrific job finding new and innovative product that our customers are engaging in."

So our understanding and knowledge of all our customers, but particularly our Pro customers because they're engaging with us at a much higher frequency than the average consumer, we're able to stitch all that behavior together in a much more robust understanding of that customer and able to make direct contact with them through our digital marketing channels and our outreach with our field sales teams, as well as our Pro associates in the store. So that the entire Pro ecosystem, with heavy emphasis on the digital capabilities, is coming together extremely nicely in driving that stickiness and share of wallet."

Our flatbed distribution centers that are often tied to those bulk distribution centers, we have 7 or 8 of those up and running now. Those are relieving the stores of the delivery volume out of the stores, as well as being a capability to capture more share of the Pro wallet.  
Our direct fulfillment centers, again, we've opened up about 7 of those. Those are going to be an expansion of -- we had 3 or 4 purpose-built pick, pack and ship facilities. And as we look to cover 90% of the country's same- or next-day delivery what will ultimately be 20-odd-plus direct fulfillment centers will allow us to cover 90% of the country in parcel same- and next-day.

Sales fo",802,"Thank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning. We were pleased with our performance in the second quarter as we achieved over $40 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in our history. Sales for the second quarter were $41.1 billion, up 8.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 4.5% from last year with U.S. comps of a positive 3.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.53 in the second quarter, up from $4.02 in the second quarter last year. 
The strong underlying demand across the business continues. During the second quarter, we did observe some changing consumer patterns in the U.S. as the U.S. economy opened up. This has manifested itself in several ways. 
We have seen a shift in pattern of sales within the week as our weekday sales performance has actually strengthened relative to the weekend. We attributed this to consumers returning to travel and other recreational activities. And while the consumers return to pre-pandemic activities, we continue to see them engage in home improvement projects. We also see customers more comfortable taking on larger projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which outpaced the DIY customer for the second quarter in a row. 
We remained agile and flexible, and we're pleased with our ability to respond to strong home improvement demand and comp to comp in the second quarter. We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented compares last year and grew sales by $3.1 billion in the second quarter and more than $12 billion year-to-date. Over the last 6 quarters, we have grown the business by more than $34 billion, a level unmatched in our market. 
From a geographic perspective, 15 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps versus last year. On a 2-year stack basis, all 19 regions saw strong double-digit comp growth. However, unlike the past 4 quarters, in the second quarter, we did experience some variability in performance from a geographic perspective. The variability in our regional performance is driven by our Northern division, where we saw a more pronounced shift in sales with stronger sales in outdoor seasonal categories during the first quarter. Mexico posted double-digit positive comps. And despite significant customer restrictions during the quarter due to COVID-19, Canada posted comps that were essentially flat in local currency. 
We continue to effectively manage the strong demand for home improvement products despite significant industry disruptions in supply chains. We are leveraging the scale of our supply chain and partnership with our vendors to prioritize key SKUs in high-demand categories. And while our in-stocks are not where we want them to be, they have improved from where they were a year ago, and our network continues to flow goods remarkably well, thanks to the investments we have made in our supply chain over a number of years. 
The team continues to make progress on building out our One Home Depot supply chain vision. We remain largely on track with our plans with the critical mass of buildings scheduled to come online this year and next. We believe that the network we are building is unique to the market. It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the breadth and depth of our current opportunity set, drive efficiency end-to-end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement. 
In the near term, we remain focused on being flexible and agile as we navigate this dynamic environment. But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals: to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider in home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, and deliver exceptional shareholder value. 
Throughout all the events of the past 18 months, our cultures remain our North Star. In fact, I recently spent time with a number of new associates that we have hired in the past year and was struck by how engaged and connected these associates were to The Home Depot culture. They were onboarded during a time when our stores and teams were busier than ever. But our associates took the time to get to know these new folks and share what it means to be part of the Orange-Blooded family. Our ability to invest for the future while also managing the most fluid environment in our company history is a direct result of our associates and their extraordinary efforts. 
I want to close by thanking them for the many ways they continue to live our values by serving our customers, communities and each other. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted."

I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their commitment to serving our customers and communities. 
As you heard from Craig, during the second quarter, we continue to see strong performance in our business, particularly as we lap the significant growth from the same period last year. We were able to meet strong customer demand despite ongoing pressures throughout the supply chain. Raw material shortages, production constraints and pressures across modes of transportation are creating a difficult supply chain environment. That being said, our performance would not be possible without the cross-functional efforts by our supply chain, merchandising, store and MET teams as we continue to flow record volumes of goods week after week. 
Over the course of the pandemic, you've heard us talk about a number of initiatives we've implemented, many in concert with our suppliers to improve our in-stock positions and get product to our customers. And our teams continue to use our culture and values to guide our decisions. 
One of our values is entrepreneurial spirit, which is alive and well at The Home Depot. Our supply chain teams recently leveraged our scale and flexibility to arrange for several container vessels for exclusive use, yet another way our teams found a creative solution to better serve our customers in this dynamic environment. 
While our in-stock levels are still not where we want them to be, we are maintaining the improvements we made over the last few quarters in building depth in key categories as evidenced by inventory growing faster than sales compared to the same period last year. 
Turning to our comp performance. During the second quarter, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by kitchen and bath and lumber. During the second quarter of this year, we saw single-digit negative comps in paint, hardware and indoor and outdoor garden. It is important to note that these were some of our strongest-performing departments during the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, each of our departments posted healthy double-digit comps. Our comp average ticket increased 11.3% and comp transactions decreased 6%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven in part by inflation in certain categories, notably lumber. On a 2-year stack basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive. 
This was another historic quarter for lumber price volatility. During the first few weeks of the second quarter, prices for both framing and panel lumber reached all-time highs before quickly falling from their peaks. As an example, during the second quarter, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,500 per 1,000 board feet before falling over $1,000 to approximately $500. While pricing for both framing and panel has come down from the peaks, the average price during the second quarter was still significantly higher than the same period last year. 
Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 420 basis points during the second quarter. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like lumber, vinyl plank flooring, gypsum and pipe and fittings. 
During the second quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth for the second quarter in a row. On a 2-year stack basis, growth with our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros. Growth with our larger Pros continues to outpace that of our smaller Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are long and growing. In fact, the National Association of Home Builders' Remodeling Index hit all-time highs during the second quarter. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the strength of several of our kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and vanities, all of which posted 1-year and 2-year comps above the company average. 
Sales leveraging our digital platforms were essentially flat during the second quarter as we lap digital sales growth of approximately 100% in the second quarter of last year. On a 2-year stack basis, sales from our digital platforms increased approximately 100%. 
We're thrilled with the customer engagement across our interconnected platforms. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner, whether it be through project inspiration and research, transacting, fulfillment or support, our customers blend the physical and digital worlds. And while customers have gotten more comfortable buying online, we've never been more confident in the importance of our physical stores as they remain the center of our customer experience due to the project nature of our business. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 55% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. 
As we look forward to the back half of the year, we know our Pros are busy and we are working hard to secure the best products to help our Pros get their jobs done. Last quarter, we highlighted several exclusive products for our Pro customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce a new big-box home improvement exclusive relationship with LP Building Solutions, a top provider of OSB panel boards. 
In addition, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our Pro Extra loyalty program. Several quarters ago, we relaunched Pro Extra, and we've been thrilled with the membership take-up and engagement we are seeing. Pro Extra offers more frequent touch points with our Pros and convenient services like purchase tracking and volume pricing along with other benefits. In addition, all Pro Extra members are now able to access our B2B Pro online experience, offering Pros more personalization on homedepot.com. 
During the third quarter, we are also thrilled to announce the rollout of what we believe is the most innovative paint offering in years through our exclusive relationship with Behr. BEHR DYNASTY is a brand-new 4-in-1 interior paint that offers DIY-ers, Pro painters and design professionals a unique product exclusively from The Home Depot. It is our most stain-repellent, scuff-resistant, fast-growing 1-coat coverage paint, all in one can. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard."

While there are many factors that impact gross margin, the year-over-year change during the second quarter was primarily driven by lumber, which accounted for approximately 60 basis points of pressure. In addition, several other factors negatively impacted our gross margin, including rising transportation costs, One Supply Chain investments and lapping a benefit from canceled events in the second quarter of last year. 
During the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 100 basis points to 17.1%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the second quarter of 2020 to support our associates. These expenses were partially offset by underspend in other expense items in the second quarter of last year, most notably payroll, as we staffed up to meet strong demand. Our operating expenses during the second quarter of this year also include wage investments that we made at the end of 2020. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter was 16.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. Interest and other expense for the second quarter decreased by $16 million to $321 million. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9%, down from 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.53, an increase of 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020. 
At the end of the quarter, inventories were $18.9 billion, up $5.4 billion from last year, and inventory turns were 5.7x compared with 6.1x this time last year. 
Turning to capital allocation. After investing in our business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $520 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.75 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 44.7%, up from 41.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. 
As you heard from Craig, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, particularly as we lap the unprecedented growth we saw this time last year. And while these challenging compares continue through the back half of the year, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. During the first 2 weeks of August, we've seen comps in the U.S. consistent with the second quarter. Customer engagement and demand for home improvement is healthy. Housing remains strong, and we see a supportive environment for home improvement spending as we look out over the next several years. 
That said, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty in the broader environment as it relates to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new and spreading variants. As we've previously shared, we do not believe we can accurately predict how the external environment will evolve and how it will ultimately impact consumer spending. We will continue to execute with flexibility and focus on what has driven our successful performance. Longer term, we remain committed to what we believe is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. 
We intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement. We intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider, and we intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement. If we do these things, we believe we will continue to grow faster than our market and we will deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. 
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we will now open the call for questions."

Or alternatively, as families return to traditional activities like your sports, watching college and pro sports, and gradually returning to the office, it's going to put accelerating pressure on the DIY business.

In addition, it's allowing us to expand our assortments from what we carry in our stores. So not only can we get the product in a quicker, more reliable fashion to our customers, we can get a broader assortment to our customers. 
And lastly, we're up to $660 a square foot of sales this past quarter in our stores. And it's just a tremendous amount of activity in cube in that building.

Is the thought there that the transactions were down largely because of lumber inflation and other sort of onetime issues and that transaction should tick back up as we move through the rest of this year and next?"

I mean that was one of our single biggest drivers of the falloff is people coming in for masks and hand sanitizers. The 4 departments that we did see negative sales, hardware, outdoor and indoor garden and paint, those are -- can tend to be more consumer-oriented, lots of units in mulch, in soil and things and paint is -- that DIY-er was home, not doing other activities on the weekend. So we're not alarmed by that falloff at all. We'll get through that.
I'd say that -- take a category like paint. I mean paint had been a 1- or 2-unit grower for several years up until the pandemic. And painting is one of the initial home improvement projects that a customer engages in and starts to build confidence in home improvement. And while we saw a dip in Q2, the levels in unit volume that we're seeing in paint is well above 2019. And I've talked about the millennials before, and the millennials are engaged in housing. They're engaging in home improvement. They've done that first project, which is painting and some gardening work generally. So we're just thrilled that they're engaged in the category and moving on to bigger projects."

You've obviously invested to take care of your associates and take care of your customers. The margin leverage has been less than what we would have expected with nearly a $50 billion, 50% increase in sales in the last 3 years. Is there some embedded operating margin improvement that can get released over the next couple of years if things return to normal? Or is the cost of doing business and other investments you've made taken some of that away?
