I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The m",1065,"Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. 
We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points our overall growth. 
Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021. 
Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas. 
Now let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. 
We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by biotech, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG. 
Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our LCMS software. This new software enables data integrity consists with important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICP-MS system, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies, and growth is strong in both services and consumables. 
Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. 
The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double digit, aided by COVID-19-related QPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business. 
As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical food businesses led the way, both growing strong double digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market. 
Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The acute end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. 
We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month. 
In addition, we're making progress on our QPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for merger use authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame. 
I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent one of America's most sustainable companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. 
We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company. 
When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished, all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results. 
Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we are building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continue to deliver. 
Our M&A fund is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win. 
As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we can have the right team to continue to succeed. 
As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down. 
We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan and margin expansion at 50 to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks. 
I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. 
Thanks for being on the call today, and look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021",1277,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. 
Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3%, while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. 
Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. 
Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens, while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation. 
We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. They're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines. The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. 
Environmental and forensics grew double digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs. 
Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LCMS. 
The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. 
And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021. 
On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth, while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. 
Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter. Our top line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was 309 million shares, as expected. 
Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- onetime tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. 
We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our annual investor event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. 
We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. 
Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. 
For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans, and while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or QPCR COVID assay in the outlook. 
As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the investor event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year. 
Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year. 
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021. 
With that, I'll go back to you for the Q&A."

So in fact, when I've talked about this most recently inside Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG business has come together. And there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help out one another, right? 
So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC LCMS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story, we've been talking about for a number of years, and you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers. They truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to add on the management side. Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them. 
And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their the next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the outside world, 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers."

You've got the end of your fresh maybe some catch-up in COVID early in the year. NASD, obviously doing very well. Selling out is becoming a bigger part of the picture. You've got the share gains. 
So I'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader -- higher levels of spend in pharma? Are we at the start of another LC replacement cycle? 
If you pay off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going forward for the next couple of years? Are we give you confidence that, that's a little more sustainable? I guess a follow-up to that."

So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then Bob will welcome your commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expect to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Even oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come. So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. 
When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but what I do think is going to happen is, is it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma.

We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points of our overall growth.  
Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021.  
Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas.  
Now let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies.  
We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by biotech, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG.  
Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our LCMS software. This new software enables data integrity, consists with important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICPMS system, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables.  
Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business.  
The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double digit, aided by COVID-19-related QPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business.  
As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical and food businesses led the way, both growing strong double digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market.  
Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The [ acute ] end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment.  
We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month.  
In addition, we're making progress on our QPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for merger use authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame.  
I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent one of America's most sustainable companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking.  
We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company.  
When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished: all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results.  
Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we are building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continue to deliver.  
Our M&A fund is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win.  
As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we can have the right team to continue to succeed.  
As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down.  
We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan and margin expansion at 50 to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks.  
I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year.  
Thanks for being on the call today, and look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021",1277,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter.  
Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.  
We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3% while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth.  
Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets.  
Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation.  
We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. They're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines. The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies, driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing.  
China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities.  
Environmental and forensics grew double digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs.  
Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LCMS.  
The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year.  
And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021.  
On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food.  
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points.  
Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter. Our top line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was 309 million shares, as expected.  
Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- onetime tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our annual investor event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program.  
We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt.  
Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.  
For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or QPCR COVID assay in the outlook.  
As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the investor event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year.  
Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year.  
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me to believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021.  
With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A."

So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC LCMS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story, we've been talking about for a number of years, and you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers. They truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to [ engagement ] management side. Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them.  
And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their the next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship.

And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Even oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come. So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. 
When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on.

So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the QPCR side that we feel confident about, and that would be on top of these. 
And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. 
And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and..."

There is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on a customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. 
So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul. We're really challenging ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working. And this allows us to put money into areas that really do matter to customers. So I'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment."

Before I get into detail -- into the quarterly details, I want to start by recognizing our Agilent India team. Despite the challenging COVID-19 situation, our India team is working closely with our customers to do what we can to help in this time of extreme need. 
In addition, our Agilent India customer support, finance, and IT teams have worked tirelessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. I could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true one Agilent fashion. Our thoughts go out the entire Agile India team and their families during this difficult time. 
In Q2, the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovery market. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. Both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid Q2 last year when revenue and earnings per share were relatively flat. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets and geographies. 
We also expanded margins, driving faster earnings per share growth. Revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. This is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. COVID-19-related revenues accounted for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributed about a point to our overall growth. 
Our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one of sustained above-market growth. For example, Our Q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from 2 years ago. Q2 operating margin of 23.9%. This is up 150 basis points. EPS of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year. 
Late in the quarter, we also welcomed the continue our investments in high-growth markets and bringing outstanding talent into Agilent. Like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, Resolution Bioscience is an example of our build and buy growth strategy in action. 
The Agilent story remains the same. It is a story of 1 team, outpacing the market to deliver strong broad-based growth in an environment of continuing market recovery. Moving on to our end market highlights. We do strongly in all markets. 
Our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. We are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. We also posted low teens growth in Diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. Lastly, environmental forensics grew 8%. Bob will provide more end market detail later in his comments. 
Geographically, the Americas led the way with 27% growth. Strength in China Europe and the rest of Asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. The 13% growth in China is on top of a 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic. 
As we look at our performance by business group, the Life Sciences Applied Markets Group generated revenues of $674 million during the quarter. LSAG is up 28% on a reported basis and up 25% core off a 7% decline last year. LSAG's growth is broad-based across all end markets and geographies. 
Our focus in investments in fast-growing end markets continues to pay off. The LSAG pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. From a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and LCMS along with continued growth in cell analysis. 
During the quarter, cell analysis grew 34% with our biotech business growing close to 40%. During the quarter, the LSAG team also contributed to our long-term company-wide focus on sustainability in advancing important ESG initiatives. LSAG announced several new products that have burned the highly respected accountability, consistency and transparency at label from my green lab. 
My green lab is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the sustainability of the scientific research. LSAG products will also receive 2 Scientist Choice Awards and now for the Select Science Virtual Analytical Summit. 
Our cell analysis business during the quarter -- in our cell analysis business during the quarter, excuse me, we launched our Citation 10 confocal imaging reader, a multifunctional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity. 
This product builds on the biotech cell imaging leadership with the citation multimode reader and expands our reach in a strategic business. While still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. We are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space. 
The crosstie group posted revenues of $536 million. This is up a reported 19% and up 15% on a core basis versus a 1% increase last year. ACG's growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab activity continues to increase for our customers. This is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption. 
Revenues from our contract business continued to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. Our strong instrument placements and the increased installed base will benefit the ACG business going forward. At the same time, our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake in consumables and our digitally-enabled services offerings. 
Our LSAG and ACG business has come together in the unigal lab. This is where we believe we are well positioned to continue driving above-market growth as we build on our market-leading portfolio, strong service organization and outstanding customer service. 
For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus a 5% increase last year. Growth is broad-based led by our NASD oligo and genomics businesses. Demand for our NASD offerings remain strong and our capacity expansion plans for our high-growth NASD business remain on track. 
We're very pleased with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience during the quarter with our liquid biopsy technology, Resolution Bioscience is a key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. We are very glad to have them on the Agilent team. I'm confident that as time goes on, you'll be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions. 
I would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. The strong momentum in our business continues. This is being driven by our lends customer focus The strength of our portfolio and the execution capability of the One Agilent team. Our Build and Buy growth strategy is delivering as intended or above-market growth. 
Over the last year, I've often said that Agilent is focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. I believe you've seen the impact of this approach in our current results. As we look ahead, We do so with a sense of both optimism and confidence. We are optimistic because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio. 
We are confident because we have the right team, customer-focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. As a result, we are once again raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details but we are expecting a continuation of excellent top line growth. 
We also expect to convert the strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation. During our investor event in December, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. 6 months into fiscal 2021, we are well on our way to achieving those objectives. 
Our Build and Buy growth strategy is delivering. The One Agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. We raised the bar in customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services. 
While we get to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence. Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I'll now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q2 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the year and the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
Revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. Core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth with all 3 business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher and all end markets growing strongly. 
From an end market perspective, our focus on fast-growing markets is paying off. Pharma, our largest market, again led the way to delivering 29% growth. This is on top of growing 5% last year. Growth was led by cell analysis, LC and mass spec. 
These tools are delivering critical capabilities to our biopharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines. Our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. 
Our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid-20s in the quarter. Overall, we are well positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue to be the strongest end market as we enter the second half of the year. 
The food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. We experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply chain. And we were very pleased to see the non-COVID diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter, growing 13% and as routine doctor visits return closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
We posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary the weak April we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. And we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels. 
The chemical and energy market continues to recover as we grew 14% off a decline of 10% last year. Our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets, and in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong, leading us to believe this trend will continue. 
We also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-COVID-related labs resume operations and a strong funding environment. With the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. We would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year. 
And lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the Americas, services and consumables and atomic spectroscopy. On a geographic basis, all regions grew, led by the Americas at 27% and of pharma and academia and government markets in Americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%. 
Europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia and government and C&E. Those 3 markets all grew more than 20%. And as Mike noted, China grew 13% after growing 4% last year. This was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s. 
Our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid-single digits during the quarter. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.4%, flat year-on-year despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency. 
Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%. Driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. Strong top line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.5%, and our share count was 307 million shares. 
Now on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our performance translated into very strong cash flows. We delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. The strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy. 
During the quarter, we returned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $195 million. And as Mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business. We spent a net of $547 million to purchase Resolution Bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures. 
Year-to-date, we've returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and while reinvesting in the business by spending $619 million on M&A and capital expenditures. And we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward. 
During the quarter, we raised $850 million in long-term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that it was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1x. 
Now turning to the outlook for the full year and the third quarter. We see a great opportunity to build on our [indiscernible] Looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end markets and have solid momentum on all of our businesses. 
As a result, we're again increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. This reflects our strong Q2 results and increasing expectations for the second half of the year. We are also incorporating the Resolution Bioscience into our guidance. 
For revenue, we are increasing our full year range to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%, included is roughly 3 points of currency and about 0.5 point attributable to M&A. 
This increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end markets. We see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in pharma, food and environmental and forensic markets and markets that we expect to continue continue to recover in the second half include the diagnostics and clinical, academia and government and C&E. 
As Mike mentioned during our investor event in December, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. Our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. And in addition, we're increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. This is growth of 25% to 26% for the year. 
Now for the third fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%. 
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say we're extremely pleased with how we've started the first half of the year. We believe our strategies and our execution of driving the strong results we've achieved and put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. With that, Ruben, back to you for Q&A."

And Tycho, the specific answer is both parts are important. Primary business today that we have in Resolution Bio related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional CDx business here at Agilent. It's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop companion diagnostics, which will ultimately you brought to market. There is some testing that's done in the CLIA lab, as you mentioned, there's a relationship with LabCorp And that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for LabCorp and also testing that will result from actual companion diagnostics that are approved as part of the pharma work that we're doing. But both are important. But the substantial part of our revenue today in this year and even in the coming 18, 24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue."

And we really see our customers, especially in our single and table cards have really taken off here in the in the last period of time. I think we heard before in the food space where we see a lot of upgrades in subparts. But clearly, in the pharma and the biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that. Really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. So when you move from small molecules than to last molecule, we're also seeing that The customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing, and hence, they are looking for a different experience, and we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms, first of all, to it up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a from usability. So that's a big part of our success and what we see. And I truly believe there's a lot more to come in that area. If you look at LC, investing into bio is a part of the game. We have had out our bias high-end ILC for quite a while now and it's doing very well. We can compete about against everyone in the space. And you will see us come out continue to come out with new products in that space.

And what it really does is that it allows -- we have built it and built it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry-level microscope that really competes very well in the market, and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in in biotech. So it's really a mix unmatched that our customers are really delighted about. And our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the biotech acquisition, which we're now leveraging also for our CEA and Seahorse But we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space, where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia government.

And so they've just done a fantastic job of supporting our customers. And as you say, we are starting to see inflationary pressures in these areas. But I would say our contracts are more long term in nature, and the teams have been able to drive with the volume as well as continued discussions, good cost controls there. at least in the near term. And on pricing, our pricing hasn't changed. We felt that we had modest price built into our plan. That's what we've seen through the first half of the year, and that's what we're assuming in the second half of the year. It depends on what group. But overall, we hadn't built in any expectation of significant price increase or decreases into our business."

A quick response for you. Our primary focus remains therapy selection. And that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the Agilent side as well as the resolution bio clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well is we do believe amenable to more applications, including minimum residual disease and monitoring. But once again, our primary focus remains through the selection. Now in terms of the model, I think you asked about that, It is what we conveyed before, which is we believe is Agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for PD-L1, where we work specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics, meaning to develop, register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they as they come to market and are approved tied to specific indication specific drugs. So that is our model. And ultimately, our vision is to have IVD kitted NGS solutions that are nearer to patients that are distributable. But of course, as you've heard even earlier, we've got a clear lab. There's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way. And that's a little bit different than the PD-L1 model that we have today because that's the nature of NGS-based diagnostic testing. But our interest in long-term focus remains on IVD kitted diagnostic tests. Jacob, over to you."

Before I get into detail -- into the quarterly details, I want to start by recognizing our Agilent India team. Despite the challenging COVID-19 situation, our India team is working closely with our customers to do what we can to help in this time of extreme need.  In addition, our Agilent India customer support, finance, and IT teams have worked tirelessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. I could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true One Agilent fashion. Our thoughts go out the entire Agile India team and their families during this difficult time.  
In Q2, the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovery market. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. Both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid Q2 last year when revenue and earnings per share were relatively flat. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets and geographies.  We also expanded margins, driving faster earnings per share growth. 
Revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. This is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. COVID-19-related revenues accounted for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributed about 1 point to our overall growth.  
Our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one of sustained above-market growth. For example, Our Q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from 2 years ago. Q2 operating margin of 23.9%; this is up 150 basis points. EPS of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year.  
Late in the quarter, we also welcomed the Resolution Bioscience team to Agilent to continue our investments in high-growth markets and bring in outstanding talent into Agilent. Like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, Resolution Bioscience is an example of our Build and Buy growth strategy in action.  
The Agilent story remains the same. It is a story of 1 team, outpacing the market to deliver strong broad-based growth in an environment of continuing market recovery. 
Moving on to our end market highlights, we do strongly in all markets.  Our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. We are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. We also posted low teens growth in diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. Lastly, environmental forensics grew 8%. Bob will provide more end market detail later in his comments.  
Geographically, the Americas led the way with 27% growth. Strength in China Europe and the rest of Asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. The 13% growth in China is on top of a 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic.  
As we look at our performance by business group, the Life Sciences Applied Markets Group generated revenues of $674 million during the quarter. LSAG is up 28% on a reported basis and up 25% core off a 7% decline last year. LSAG's growth is broad-based across all end markets and geographies.  
Our focus in investments in fast-growing end markets continues to pay off. The LSAG pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. From a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and LC/MS along with continued growth in cell analysis.  
During the quarter, cell analysis grew 34% with our BioTek business growing close to 40%. During the quarter, the LSAG team also contributed to our long-term company-wide focus on sustainability in advancing important ESG initiatives. LSAG announced several new products that have earned the highly respected accountability, consistency and transparency ACT label from My Green Lab.  My Green Lab is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the sustainability of scientific research. LSAG products will also receive 2 Scientist Choice Awards, and now for the Select Science Virtual Analytical Summit.  
Our cell analysis business during the quarter -- in our cell analysis business during the quarter, excuse me, we launched our Cytation 10 confocal imaging reader, a multifunctional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity.  This product builds on the BioTek cell imaging leadership with the Cytation multimode reader and expands our reach in a strategic business. While still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. We are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space.  
The Agilent CrossLab group posted revenues of $536 million. This is up a reported 19% and up 15% on a core basis versus a 1% increase last year. ACG's growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab activity continues to increase for our customers. This is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption.  
Revenues from our contract business continued to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. Our strong instrument placements and the increased installed base will benefit the ACG business going forward. At the same time, our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake in consumables and our digitally-enabled services offerings.  
Our LSAG and ACG business has come together in the  [ analytical ] lab. This is where we believe we are well positioned to continue driving above-market growth as we build on our market-leading portfolio, strong service organization and outstanding customer service.  
For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus the 5% increase last year. Growth is broad-based led by our NASD oligo and genomics businesses. Demand for our NASD offerings remain strong and our capacity expansion plans for our high-growth NASD business remain on track.  
We're very pleased with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience during the quarter. With our liquid biopsy technology, Resolution Bioscience is a key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. We are very glad to have them on the Agilent team. I'm confident that as time goes on, you'll be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions.  
I would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. The strong momentum in our business continues. This is being driven by our relentless customer focus, the strength of our portfolio and the execution capability of the One Agilent team. Our Build and Buy growth strategy is delivering as intended with above-market growth.  Over the last year, I've often said that Agilent is focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. I believe you've seen the impact of this approach in our current results. 
As we look ahead, We do so with a sense of both optimism and confidence. We are optimistic because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio.  We are confident because we have the right team; customer-focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. As a result, we are once again raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth.  We also expect to convert the strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation. 
During our investor event in December, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. Six months into fiscal 2021, we are well on our way to achieving those objectives.  Our Build and Buy growth strategy is delivering. The One Agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. We raised the bar in customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services.  While we get to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence. 
Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I'll now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q2 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the year and the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.  
Revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. Core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth with all 3 business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher and all end markets growing strongly.  
From an end market perspective, our focus on fast-growing markets is paying off. Pharma, our largest market, again led the way to delivering 29% growth. This is on top of growing 5% last year. Growth was led by cell analysis, LC and mass spec.  These tools are delivering critical capabilities to our biopharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines. Our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. 
Our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid-20s in the quarter. Overall, we are well positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue to be the strongest end market as we enter the second half of the year.  
The food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. We experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply chain. And we were very pleased to see the non-COVID diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter, growing 13% as routine doctor visits return closer to pre-pandemic levels.  
We posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary the weak April we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. And we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels.  
The chemical and energy market continues to recover as we grew 14% off a decline of 10% last year. Our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets. And in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong, leading us to believe this trend will continue.  
We also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-COVID-related labs resume operations in a strong funding environment. With the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. We would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year.  
And lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the Americas, services and consumables and atomic spectroscopy. 
On a geographic basis, all regions grew, led by the Americas at 27%, while pharma and academia and government markets in Americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%.  
Europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia and government and C&E. Those 3 markets all grew more than 20%. And as Mike noted, China grew 13% after growing 4% last year. This was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s.  Our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid-single digits during the quarter. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.4%, flat year-on-year despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency.  Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%. Driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. Strong top line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was 307 million shares.  
Now on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our performance translated into very strong cash flows. We delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. The strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy.  
During the quarter, we returned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing 1.55 million shares for $195 million. And as Mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business. We spent a net of $547 million to purchase Resolution Bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures.  
Year-to-date, we've returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while reinvesting in the business by spending $619 million on M&A and capital expenditures. And we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward.  
During the quarter, we raised $850 million in long-term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1x.  
Now turning to the outlook for the full year and the third quarter. We see a great opportunity to build on our strong first half results. Looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end markets and have solid momentum on all of our businesses.  As a result, we're again increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. This reflects our strong Q2 results and increasing expectations for the second half of the year. We are also incorporating the Resolution Bioscience into our guidance.  
For revenue, we are increasing our full year range to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%. Included is roughly 3 points of currency and about 0.5 point attributable to M&A.  
This increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end markets. We see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in pharma, food and environmental and forensic markets, and markets that we expect to continue to recover in the second half include the diagnostics and clinical, academia and government and C&E.  
As Mike mentioned during our investor event in December, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. Our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. And in addition, we're increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. This is growth of 25% to 26% for the year.  
Now for the third fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%.  
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say we're extremely pleased with how we've started the first half of the year. We believe our strategies and our execution of driving the strong results we've achieved can put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. With that, Ruben, back to you for Q&A."

And Tycho, the specific answer is both parts are important. Primary business today that we have in Resolution Bio is related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional CDx business here at Agilent. It's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop Companion Diagnostics, which we ultimately brought to market. There is some testing that's done in the CLIA lab, as you mentioned. There's a relationship with LabCorp. And that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for LabCorp and also testing that will result from actual Companion Diagnostics that are approved as part of the pharma work that we're doing. But both are important. But the substantial part of our revenue today in this year and even in the coming 18, 24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue."

On one hand, you guided fiscal Q3 revenue expectations well above consensus. On the other hand, your guidance assumes essentially that revenue is going to move sideways, maybe even moved, I think, down sequentially in a quarter, which I think is normally a little bit better relative to fiscal Q2, if for no other reason. Then in China, 1 of your bigger markets, you don't have Lunar New Year in that period. And then if we kind of back into the Q4 implied number, there's, I think, something like 4% sequential growth and a pretty big implied moderation in year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year, even accounting for comps. So there's all that. You got more M&A in there. And then I listened to what you're saying in your prepared remarks and look at the numbers, and it sure seems like you're crushing it with no slowdown. So am I missing anything here?"

The short answer on that. Let me take the question around investment. The biggest investment that we have going forward is really the addition of the Resolution Science business and continuing to invest behind the capabilities there, both from an R&D and development perspective as well as the channel.

But we are continuing to invest in demand-driving activities. Some of those things like we just talked about in ACG around the digital aspects, but also building capabilities to continue that momentum going, whether it be marketing programs and other activities within our R&D pipeline.

And Bob and Sam, you guys keep me honest here as well. But in a pharma services business model we have where we can leverage a lot of investments that we've already made around our ISC-based CDx business, we're not in the same division to increment perhaps maybe a start-up or somebody brand-new entering the space. So we have something to build from. So I think our expense structure may look -- perhaps look different than others in this space. 
We do plan to invest aggressively on the R&D side as well kind of building out additional commercial relationships. But we think our plan has been to absorb it within the overall operating model. So there wasn't an asterisk when we put our long-term goals out and said no, well, without Res Bio. I think we believe that we can manage this in our overall operating model. 
And I think given where we're starting from, which is we're not starting from 0 in this business, we have something to build from, from our acquisition a number of years ago from Dako, I think that puts us in a different -- perhaps a different place.  Anything else to add?"

First of all, the -- what the growth you're seeing, both in our LC and LC/MS space is certainly not a coincidence. It's something we have invested in for quite some years. If you really think about our mass spec portfolio, we have really invested and innovated around the lines of robot [ reliable ] and the team. And we really see our customers, especially in our single and triple quad, have really taken off here in the  last period of time. I think we heard before in the food space where we see a lot of upgrades to triple quad. But clearly, in the pharma and the biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that. Really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. 
So when you move from small molecules into large molecules, we're also seeing that the customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing, and hence, they are looking for a different experience. And we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms, first of all, to level up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a usability. So that's a big part of our success and what we see. And I truly believe there's a lot more to come in that area. 
If you look at LC, investing into bio is a part of the game. We have had out our bio LC, high-end bio LC for quite a while now and it's doing very well. We can compete about against everyone in the space. And you will see us come out -- continue to come out with new products in that space. So we feel very good where we are, and we'll continue to invest to continue to keep -- take market share in this very important market for us."

I think Bob also talked about that, which is a new confocal microscope. And what it really does is that it allows -- we have built it and built it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry-level microscope that really competes very well in the market, and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in  BioTek. So it's really a mix and match that our customers are really delighted about. 
And our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the BioTek acquisition, which we're now leveraging also for our ACEA and Seahorse, but we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia and government. We had a very clear focus areas to move in and that works very well. So we're very excited where we are, but I would say that the main growth comes from the biopharma space.

Our primary focus remains therapy selection. And that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the Agilent side as well as the resolution bio clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well. Now the fundamental technology is, we do believe, amenable to more applications, including minimum residual disease and monitoring. But once again, our primary focus remains through the selection. 
Now in terms of the model, I think you asked about that. It is what we conveyed before, which is we believe is Agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for PD-L1, where we work specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics, meaning to develop, register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they  come to market and are approved tied to specific indication-specific drugs. So that is our model. And ultimately, our vision is to have IVD kitted NGS solutions that are nearer to patients that are distributable. But of course, as you've heard even earlier, we've got a CLIA lab, and there's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way. And that's a little bit different than the PD-L1 model that we have today because that's the nature of NGS-based diagnostic testing. But our interest and long-term focus remains on IVD kitted diagnostic tests. Jacob, over to you."

And with Agilent's broad portfolio, we can very quickly and we can very well do this. So I'm very excited about that, and we continue to invest.

And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before covering our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Dr. Tachi Yamada, a giant in our industry and a former Agilent Board member. Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent Board member for 9 years. As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who has driven to help others. I know that the Agilent team is not alone and recognize that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed, and we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family. 
Now under third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year. In Q3, the very strong broad-based momentum in our business continues. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations. Q3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. This is against a modest decline of 3% in Q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. 
In addition, as another positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets and geographies. The combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth in profitability and earnings per share. 
Our Q3 operating margin is 26%. This is up 230 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. Agilent's success continues to be driven by our build-and-buy growth strategy and execution prowess. We are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast-growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerge even stronger as a company. While we have yet to leave COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions by delivering the intended results. Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but I want to briefly highlight our performance in our 2 largest end markets, Pharma and Chemical Energy. 
We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid-20s just a few years ago. 
In Chemical Energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half, and our order funnel continues to strengthen. 
Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $680 million. LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis. This is up 18% core of just a 4% decline last year. LSAG's growth is broad-based across all end markets. Our performance was led by strength in pharma, which is up 22% and chemical energy up 31%. All businesses delivered strong growth, led by cell analysis at 38% growth and our LC and LC/MS businesses, which grew 22%. We continue to strengthen our position in the fast-growing large molecule market segment. 
During the quarter, the LSAG team launched 3 InfinityLab Bio LC systems at the well-attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June. These new products further extend our LC leadership position. In addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance-ready LC QTOF and LC TOF solutions to our portfolio in the quarter. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $560 million. This is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. These results are on top of 1% growth last year. The business is benefiting from increased activity in customer labs and instrument connect rates. This is leading to more contracted services, on-demand services and consumables consumption across all end markets. All end markets grew mid-teens or higher with the exception of environmental forensics, which still grew 9%. The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business with ACG growing each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged. Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends. Looking forward, instrument placements and demand bode well for citing strong performance by ACG as we drive attachment rates and increase customer lifetime value. 
The Diagnostic and Genomics Group produced revenue of $346 million, up 44% reported and up 37% core compared to an 8% decline last year. The growth is broad-based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP oligo business. The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well. The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily surpassing the $50 million revenue milestone. While 1 quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing output in a high-quality manner. This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate in revenue with existing capacity. 
In addition, the Train B manufacturing line expansion is well underway and on schedule. Our genomics instrumentation and consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter as did our pathology-related businesses. For the first time in several quarters, we saw a diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. While we are watching the Delta variant very closely, to date, we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes. 
I also want to highlight our performance in China. While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter. We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position. In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China-based biopharma company. Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line. We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG product and services offerings. 
In addition, the integration of the resolution Bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast-growing NGS-based cancer diagnostic market. 
It was a busy quarter at Agilent. So I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you. Last month, we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a company. We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than 2 decades ago. I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website. 
We're also very pleased to receive recognition as a Great Place to Work in the United States by the Great Place to Work Institute. This result is just 1 more example of Agilent having a highly engaged and energized team. And as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. 
Looking ahead, building another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be an outstanding fiscal year 2021. As a result, we are once again raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we're expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth and earnings generation. While [indiscernible] has yet to fully emerge in the global pandemic, Agilent is well positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders. 
I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike",986,"Thanks, Mike. 
[Audio Gap]
Through the income statement and some other key financial metrics, I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the third quarter. Revenue was $1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of [ 26%. ] Core revenue growth was 21%. Currency added 4.5% to the quarter and M&A added 0.5 point. In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year. 
All end markets performed well with Pharma and Chemical Energy as standout versus our expectations. Our largest market, Pharma, grew 27% during the quarter after growing 2% last year. The performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business growing 52%, while our small molecule business grew mid-teens. In all regions, our large molecule business was driven by our NASD division and mass spec instrumentation and solutions, while our small molecule business was primarily driven by QA/QC refresh. 
Chemical & Energy also performed well this quarter with 23% growth. Even after accounting for 
[Audio Gap]
this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. This result was driven by increasing momentum and demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. Our view is that the chemical and energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward. 
The diagnostics and clinical market grew 28% against a decline of 10% a year ago, our softest quarter last year. We are very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth. On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and Americas delivering 38% growth. 
In the academia and government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. On a regional basis, Europe led the way. The food market continued its double-digit performance, growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity. 
A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S., also contributed to key markets, environmental and 
[Audio Gap]
On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth, led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. The performance was broad-based across all markets. And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. All 3 business groups grew in China during the quarter. Pharma, chemical and energy and diagnostics were the key drivers. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 80 basis points from a year ago despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency. Our strong top line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team drove the year-on-year improvement. And our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers despite the increase in demand. 
Gross margin improvement -- performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.10, up 41% versus last year, and share count was 306 million shares as expected. We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and a [ $1 billion  ] mark in 9 months. During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. 
Year-to-date, we've returned [ $829 million ] to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. 
Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.
[Audio Gap]
up $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4%.  
[Audio Gap]
and a small amount from M&A. In addition, we're on track to deliver roughly $100 million in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.28 and to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year. This translates to fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion. This represents reported growth of [ 10% ] to 
[Audio Gap]
[ 12.5% ] to 10%. 
[Audio Gap]
In Q4 of last year, when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns. In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high watermark in our COVID-related revenue. And as a result, we expect to see roughly a 1 point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter. So our core growth, excluding COVID, would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%. 
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses and expect to close the year extremely well. We believe our strategy is the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results we've been producing without the excellent execution by the team. With that, Parmee, back to you for Q&A."

So that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum, and it allows us to play for all the Bionote, biocompatible space to the 2 DLC, but clearly also into the mass spec with embarking the end of it. And we also mentioned the compliance, the FDA Part 11 informatics Compliance is another very important part that most of the biopharma sees as a requirement to do business with them.

And our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. And these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities. And what we've been able to do is be very successful. 
Certainly, volume is our friend. And the leverage that we've been able to drive across all 3 of our business groups has really helped. But if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs, and digital investments. Our digital investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. And in fact, Jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. And so those are -- our goals are for those to continue -- they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic. So we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. And that's why Mike talked about kind of our long-term margin expansion story is intact. It's not going to be 200-plus basis points like it was this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion."

And our ability to continue to invest in digital as well as be there on-site, on the labs, with the labs is really important. One piece that I would add is we continue to invest in that digital, as I mentioned before. And our online orders actually grew faster, our revenue grew faster than the overall ACG business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space.

And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before covering our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Dr. Tachi Yamada, a giant in our industry and a former Agilent Board Member. Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent Board Member for 9 years. As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others. I know that the Agilent team is not alone in recognizing that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed, and we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family. 
Now on to the third quarter review and our updated outlook for the year. In Q3, the very strong broad-based momentum in our business continues. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations. Q3 revenue of $1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. This is against a modest decline of 3% in Q3 of last year, so we are well above fiscal year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. 
In addition, as another positive sign of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets and geographies. The combination of strong top line performance and execution translated into excellent growth in profitability and earnings per share. 
Our Q3 operating margin is 26%. This is up 230 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. Agilent's success continues to be driven by our build-and-buy growth strategy and execution prowess. We are developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast-growing businesses while delivering outstanding customer service and continue to drive profitability. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerge even stronger as a company. While we have yet to leave COVID-19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results. Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, but I want to briefly highlight our performance in our 2 largest end markets, pharma and chemical and energy. 
We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market, growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall pharma revenue, up from the mid-20s just a few years ago. 
In chemical and energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half, and our order funnel continues to strengthen. 
Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $680 million. LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis. This is up 18% core off just a 4% decline last year. LSAG's growth is broad-based across all end markets. Our performance was led by strength in pharma, which is up 22%, and chemical and energy, up 31%. All businesses delivered strong growth, led by cell analysis at 38% growth and our LC and LC/MS businesses, which grew 22%. We continue to strengthen our position in the fast-growing large molecule market segment. 
During the quarter, the LSAG team launched 3 InfinityLab Bio LC systems at the well-attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June. These new products further extend our LC leadership position. In addition, building on our already strong pharma offerings, we launched new compliance-ready LC/Q-TOF and LC/TOF solutions to our portfolio in the quarter. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $560 million. This is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. These results are on top of 1% growth last year. 
The business is benefiting from increased activity in customer labs and instrument connect rates. This is leading to more contracted services, on-demand services and consumables consumption across all end markets. All end markets grew mid-teens or higher with the exception of environmental and forensics, which still grew 9%. 
The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business, with ACG growing each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged. Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends. Looking forward, instrument placements and demand bode well for continued strong performance by ACG as we drive attachment rates and increase customer lifetime value. 
The Diagnostic and Genomics Group produced revenue of $346 million, up 44% reported and up 37% core compared to an 8% decline last year. The growth is broad-based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP oligo business. The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well. The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily surpassing the $50 million revenue milestone. While one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing output in a high-quality manner. This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate in revenue with existing capacity. 
In addition, the Train B manufacturing line expansion is well underway and on schedule. Our genomics instrumentation and consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter, as did our pathology-related businesses. For the first time in several quarters, we saw diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. While we are watching the Delta variant very closely, to date, we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes. 
I also want to highlight our performance in China. While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter. We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position. In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China-based biopharma company. Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line. We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG product and services offerings. 
In addition, the integration of the Resolution Bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast-growing NGS-based cancer diagnostic market. 
It was a busy quarter at Agilent. So I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you. Last month, we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a company. We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than 2 decades ago. I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website. 
We're also very pleased to receive recognition as a Great Place to Work in the United States by the Great Place to Work Institute. This result is just one more example of Agilent having a highly engaged and energized team. And as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. 
Looking ahead, building another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be an outstanding fiscal year 2021. As a result, we are once again raising our full year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we're expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth and earnings generation. 
While the world has yet to fully emerge in the global pandemic, Agilent is well positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders. 
Thanks for being on the call today, I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the four",1088,"Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the third quarter. Revenue was $1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%. Core revenue growth was 21%. Currency added 4.5% for the quarter and M&A added 0.5 point. In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year. 
All end markets performed well, with pharma and chemical and energy as standouts versus our expectations. Our largest market, pharma, grew 27% during the quarter after growing 2% last year. The performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business growing 52%, while our small molecule business grew mid-teens. And all regions in the pharma market grew double digits. 
Our large molecule business was driven by our NASD division and demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation and solutions, while our small molecule business was primarily driven by QA/QC refresh. 
Chemical and energy also performed well this quarter with 23% growth. Even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. This result was driven by increasing momentum and demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. Our view is that the chemical and energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward. 
The diagnostics and clinical market grew 28% against a decline of 10% a year ago, our softest quarter last year. We are very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth. On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and Americas delivering 38% growth. 
In the academia and government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. On a regional basis, Europe led the way. The food market continued its double-digit performance, growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. 
Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity. 
A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S., also contributed to growth in this market. And regionally, the food market was led by the Americas and Europe. Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth. 
On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth, led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. The performance was broad-based across all markets. And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. All 3 business groups grew in China during the quarter. Pharma, chemical and energy and diagnostics were the key drivers. 
Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 80 basis points from a year ago despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency. Our strong top line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team drove the year-on-year improvement. And our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers despite the increase in demand. 
Gross margin improvement -- performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.10, up 41% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and share count was 306 million shares, as expected.
We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year while crossing the $1 billion  mark in 9 months. During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. 
Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. 
Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.
We are increasing our full year revenue projection to a range of $6.29 billion to $6.32 billion, up $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4%  and core growth of 14.5% to 15%. Included is roughly 3 points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A. In addition, we're on track to deliver roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.28 and to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year. This translates to fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion. This represents reported growth of 10% to 12% and core growth of 8.5% to 10%, on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns. 
In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high watermark in our COVID-related revenue. And as a result, we expect to see roughly a 1 point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter. So our core growth, excluding COVID, would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%. 
Now before opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses and expect to close the year extremely well. We believe our strategy is the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results we've been producing without the excellent execution by the team. 
With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A."

We're seeing this good strong pharma and C&E demand in China now, and the funnel has really remained quite robust. 
And I think now getting to your specific question, we're not seeing any significant changes in terms of ability to get product in. I mean there's been a lot of noise for years, I have to say, between the United States and China, yet the business seems to somehow get transacted. So Bob, I think we're not really overly concerned about those dynamics. And we did have somewhat of a little bit of shipment interruption as some of our academia and government customers were -- had to work through a VAT tax exemption change. But I think that was relatively minor impact on the P&L. So -- but clearly, we're monitoring those developments. And you have to continue to work to make sure you've got your logistics flowing through the country, but we've always been able to find a way and are not overly concerned about it at this point."

In fact, we had -- and in one of the big -- a lot of our momentum is that with that Bio LC that we introduced here a few months ago. And we had a virtual conference with more than the 1,000 customers participating, and we had more than 25 external scientific speakers, which I would actually say, I know it's the best in the industry by far. So that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum, and it allows us to play for all the bionode, biocompatible space for the 2D-LC, but clearly also into the mass spec we'd embark at the end of it. 
And we also mentioned the compliance, the FDA Part 11 informatics compliance is another very important part that most of the biopharma sees as a requirement to do business with them.

And our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. And these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities. And what we've been able to do is be very successful. 
Certainly, volume is our friend. And the leverage that we've been able to drive across all 3 of our business groups has really helped. But if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs and digital investments, our digital investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. And in fact, Jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. 
And so those are -- our goals are for those to continue -- they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic. So we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. And that's why Mike talked about kind of our long-term margin expansion story is intact. It's not going to be 200-plus basis points like it was this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion."

And I think the confidence is coming from not only the revenues that we reported. But as Bob mentioned, in general, and I think it also holds for C&E, we just have much better visibility into our funnel. And you may recall I was talking a lot of -- in prior calls, I talked a lot about conversations we're having with customers, and we knew there was activity. But now that conversation is turning into orders. 
So we're feeling much better about the trajectory of the C&E space. And I've historically been very, very cautious to give any real kind of positive trends in this area. But I think we've seen enough over the last few quarters. And what we're seeing with our customers in the order book is really the basis for this confidence. And again, it's tied to not only the pent-up demand they've had in terms of needing to replace aged equipment in their laboratories, but they also -- what we hear from our customers, they are much more confident about where the global economy is going, so they're willing to make investments. 
I know there's couple of pauses here and there, and there'll be some ups and downs because of outbreaks here and there of COVID. But in general, the trend remains very positive. I think, as Bob mentioned earlier, our customers have learned to deal with this. So Bob, I know this is -- we talked a lot about this. Anything I missed there?"

And our ability to continue to invest in digital as well as be there on-site, on the labs -- or with the labs is really important. 
One piece that I would add is we continue to invest in that digital, as I mentioned before. And our online orders actually grew faster. Our revenue grew faster than the overall ACG business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space. And obviously, that's good for our customers in terms of either doing business with Agilent, but it also helps from that margin perspective as well."

At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last ye",1221,"Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. 
The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding record setting 2021. At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year core growth is up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our 3 business units all growing more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $4.34 are up 32%. 
Let's now take a closer look at our strong finish in 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4. And at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis. 
Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations. 
We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market, growing 21% driven by our biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of our revenue just 2 years ago. 
The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive and we expect that chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical, revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year as testing volumes started to recover. 
On a geographic basis, our results led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. 
Now looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG's growth was broad-based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis, the pharma [indiscernible] purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time. 
During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our VWorks automation software suite. These new well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics. 
The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core. Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services as well as for chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us. The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well continued to strengthen our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year. 
The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13% core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect 1 year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput at with the existing capacity. 
The expansion of our Train B oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado, is proceeding as planned. We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year 2022. 
Moving on from our other business group updates. There are several other significant developments for Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigorous sustainability that we applied to everything else we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-term success. 
Our sustainable leadership continues to be prominently recognized as well. You may have seen that Investors Business Daily recently named Agilent to its top 100 ESG Companies list. We're also a company where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the world's best employers and as the best workplace for women. 
While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above-market growth and leading customer satisfaction, we're always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent commercial organization, combining for the first time all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our sales, marketing, digital channel and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization is led by McDonald. will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group President as well as serve as Agilent's first ever Chief Commercial Officer. 
The way I'd like to characterize this move to say we are doubling down on the success we've achieved with ACG, applying a holistic customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business. 
We're also moving the chemistries and supplies division to LSAG. This close organizational alignment between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that structure follows strategy and that this new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth strategies. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our build and buy growth strategy. Agilent's business remains strong. We entered the new year with a robust backlog and have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range. While reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth, we are now 1 year in and well on our way to achieve these long-term goals. Bob will provide more details. 
But for fiscal 2022, our initial full year guide calls for core growth in the range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect to continue our top line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing businesses and deliver outstanding customer service. 
My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the Agilent team, the best is yet to come for our customers, our team and our shareholders. 
Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics.

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting reported growth of 12%. And before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team, which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment. 
Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for 0.8% of growth while M&A contributed 0.5 point of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19-related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over 1 point headwind to the quarterly revenue growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were, in certain cases, greater than anticipated, resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1. 
Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma and in biopharma in particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us. Our largest market, pharma, grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year. The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY '22, we expect our pharma business to grow in the high single digits. 
Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum in chemicals and engineered materials, and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next year in the high single digits. 
Diagnostics and clinical grew 11%, with all 3 groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and mass spec. 
We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the year, the Diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020, and we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits in 2022. 
Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business, was up 1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase capacity to pre-pandemic levels. China came in at low single digits, while the Americas and Europe were roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single digits. 
Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food to return to historical growth rates in the low single digits. 
And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5% decline last year as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020. And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics to grow in the low single digits in the coming year. 
For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4, led by Americas at 15%, China grew 8% and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by China at 13% and Europe at 12%. 
Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin performance along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefited from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full year tax rate was 14.25%. 
Our share count was 305 million shares as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation resulting in $441 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash and invested $188 million in capital expenditures. 
During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. All in all, a great end to an outstanding year. 
Now let's move on to the outlook for fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong backlog and momentum. For the full year, we're expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and $6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7%, consistent with our long-range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly 0.5 point headwind associated with COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1. 
We're expecting all 3 of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high single digits with the continued contribution of NASD in cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow in high single digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is expected to grow in mid-single digits. 
We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build-out cost of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.25% consistent with current tax policies and 305 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per share, resulting in double-digit growth. 
And finally, we expect operating cash flow of an approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online, and expanding consumables manufacturing capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter guidance. But before I get into the specifics, some additional context. Lunar New Year is February 1 this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down ahead of the holiday. In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these 2 factors will impact our base business growth by 2 to 3 points and a roughly equal in impact. 
For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds, core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18. 
And a couple of additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with the new One Agilent commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting in Q1. In addition, we'll be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for the segment changes after the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K in December. 
I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A."

One is just the breadth of responsibilities that the would have if we had made that change. But we think it's actually going to be a driver of growth. And I'll ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second because we think by having those teams even closer together, we're going to be able to even further accelerate our connect rates on instruments with our chemistry products. 
Why the change? Hey, it's best to make -- when things are going really well, it's really time to put down the hammer and really go as hard as you can. And that's what we're doing here. So as you may know, when I first came in as CEO, I had 5 sales forces. I collapse those into 2. This is the next evolution of that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that the segmentation of our markets really costs are much more of a customer orientation as opposed to a product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers. 
And when you think about the scale you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services organization, this makes sense to do this while you're on top of your game. So while things are going well, we thought it was really trying to pick the accelerate down even further.

And so if we think about that, that's closer to 75 to close to that 100 basis points. 
A lot of that's going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not growing our business expenses as fast as the top line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of the inflationary pressures on the top line with that price that I talked about before, which we didn't really have any significant price in 2021. We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to reflect that. And so a combination of it, most of it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small operating leverage of the top line as well if you take out the -- excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our costs through pricing increases."

And as we continue to place our focus on the biopharma or the large molecule, if you look at that throughout 2021, that was much -- growing much faster than the overall pharma business. And so we would expect that -- we feel very good about that business going forward."

The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding record-setting 2021. At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year core growth is up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our 3 business units all growing more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $4.34 are up 32%. 
Let's now take a closer look at our strong finish in 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4. And at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis. 
Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations. 
We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market, growing 21% driven by our biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of our revenue just 2 years ago. 
The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive, and we expect that chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical, revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year as testing volumes started to recover. 
On a geographic basis, our results led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. 
Now looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG's growth was broad-based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis. The pharma and chemical and energy market were particularly strong for new instrument purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time. 
During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our VWorks automation software suite. These new, well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics. 
The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core. Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services as well as for chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us. The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well for continued strength in our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year. 
The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13% core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with the existing capacity. 
The expansion of our Train B oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado, is proceeding as planned. We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year 2022. 
Moving on from our other business group updates. There are several other significant developments for Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigorous sustainability that we applied to everything else we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-term success. 
Our sustainable leadership continues to be prominently recognized as well. You may have seen that Investors Business Daily recently named Agilent to its top 100 ESG Companies list. We're also a company where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the world's Best Employers and as the Best Workplace for Women. 
While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above-market growth and leading customer satisfaction, we're always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent Commercial organization, combining for the first time all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our sales, marketing, digital channel and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization is led by Padraig McDonnell. Padraig will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group President as well as serve as Agilent's first-ever Chief Commercial Officer. The way I'd like to characterize this move to say we are doubling down on the success we've achieved with ACG, applying a holistic customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business. 
We're also moving the chemistries and supplies division to LSAG. This close organizational alignment between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that structure follows strategy and that this new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth strategies. 
Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our build and buy growth strategy. Agilent's business remains strong. We entered the new year with a robust backlog and have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. We are now 1 year in and well on our way to achieving these long-term goals. Bob will provide more details. 
But for fiscal 2022, our initial full year guide calls for core growth in the range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect to continue our top line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing businesses and deliver outstanding customer service. 
My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the Agilent team, the best is yet to come for our customers, our team and our shareholders. 
Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?"

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics.

In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. 
As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting reported growth of 12%. And before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team, which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment. 
Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for 0.8% of growth while M&A contributed 0.5 point of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19-related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over 1 point headwind to the quarterly revenue growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were, in certain cases, greater than anticipated, resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1. 
Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma and in biopharma in particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us. Our largest market, pharma, grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year. The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY '22, we expect our pharma business to grow in the high single digits.  
Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum in chemicals and engineered materials, and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next year in the high single digits. 
Diagnostics and clinical grew 11%, with all 3 groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and mass spec. 
We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the year, the diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020, and we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high single digits in 2022. 
Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business, was up 1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase capacity to pre-pandemic levels. China came in at low single digits, while the Americas and Europe were roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single digits. 
Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food to return to historical growth rates in the low single digits. 
And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5% decline last year as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020. And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics to grow in the low single digits in the coming year. 
For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4, led by Americas at 15%, China grew 8% and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by China at 13% and Europe at 12%. 
Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin performance along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefited from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full year tax rate was 14.25%. 
Our share count was 305 million shares, as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation resulting in $441 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash and invested $188 million in capital expenditures. 
During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. All in all, a great end to an outstanding year. 
Now let's move on to the outlook for fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong backlog and momentum. For the full year, we're expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and $6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7%, consistent with our long-range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly 0.5 point headwind associated with COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1. 
We're expecting all 3 of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high single digits with the continued contribution of NASD in cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow in high single digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is expected to grow in mid-single digits. 
We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build-out cost of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.25%, consistent with current tax policies and 305 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per share, resulting in double-digit growth. 
And finally, we expect operating cash flow of an approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online, and expanding consumables manufacturing capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. 
Now let's move on to our first quarter guidance. But before I get into the specifics, some additional context. Lunar New Year is February 1 this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down ahead of the holiday. In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these 2 factors will impact our base business growth by 2 to 3 points and a roughly equal in impact. 
For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds, core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18. 
And a couple of additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with the new One Agilent commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting in Q1. In addition, we'll be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for the segment changes after the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K in December. 
I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A."

So let me handle the second part of your question first, which is the ACG Group will be 100% services in 2022. And then we're moving over the CSD ports in the chemistry and supplies portion of that business over to Jacob for 2 reasons. One is just the breadth of responsibilities that Padraig would have if we had made that change. But we think it's actually going to be a driver of growth. And I'll ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second because we think by having those teams even closer together, we're going to be able to even further accelerate our connect rates on instruments with our chemistry products. 
Why the change? Hey, it's best to make -- when things are going really well, it's really time to put down the hammer and really go as hard as you can. And that's what we're doing here. So as you may know, when I first came in as CEO, I had 5 sales forces. I collapse those into 2. This is the next evolution of that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that the segmentation of our markets really costs are much more of a customer orientation as opposed to a product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers. 
And when you think about the scale you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services organization, this makes sense to do this while you're on top of your game. So while things are going well, we thought it was really trying to put the accelerator down even further.

And so if we think about that, that's closer to 75 to close to that 100 basis points.  
A lot of that's going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not growing our business expenses as fast as the top line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of the inflationary pressures on the top line with that price that I talked about before, which we didn't really have any significant price in 2021. We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to reflect that. And so a combination of it, most of it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small operating leverage of the top line as well if you take out the -- excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our costs through pricing increases."

We feel very good about where we are given our forecast and backlog. So we're -- I would say our -- we have a bias towards the upside in our forecast as opposed to bias towards the downside."

And so we talked a little bit about cell analysis but also cell analysis in LSAG has been very accretive both on the gross margin as well as the operating profit side. 
And so we've got these faster-growing businesses that are helping with mix and then we're adding on the incremental price to cover the inflationary pressures that we are seeing and so forth. But we've also got productivity measures in place. And this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and our infrastructure really pays dividends because we're able to leverage those costs across a larger base.
