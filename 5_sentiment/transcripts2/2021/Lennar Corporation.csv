And as usual, Diane will give detailed financial information, highlights and additional guidance. Then we'll attempt to answer as many of your questions as possible. [Operator Instructions]
So from a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong. Demand has continued to strengthen as the millennial generation, which had previously postponed its entry into the housing market, has now continued to drive family formation, while at the same time, the supply of new and existing homes remains constrained. Even though interest rates have moved higher, at the same time that home prices have moved higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were 1 year ago and personal savings for deposits are strengthening. 
Many American families have fortified savings. Vacations and recreational activities have been canceled or postponed, and stimulus money from the government continues to fill the remaining gaps. The American dream of homeownership is an essential aspiration of the American population and the seemingly imminent resolution of the pandemic is not slowing the growing demand. 
Apartment dwellers can today afford a first time home, and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling quickly, end at higher prices, enabling first-time move ups. The market for yesterday's move up home is strong and enabling customers to consider and purchase a larger home with a larger yard, with an office, a nicer kitchen and a new set of necessary spaces for an evolving market. 
Also, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to sell and purchase homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transactions. The underproduction of homes for the past 10 years has created a housing shortage. And with strong demand, home prices are moving higher. 
Although this reality is exacerbating the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, as workforce housing is limited and getting more expensive, the solution it seems will be in the growing supply by -- will be in growing supply by building more housing. 
Current conditions have given rise to strong pricing power, strong, though controlled sales pace, certainly, labor and material increases, very strong gross margins and even stronger net margins and, of course, the challenge of land scarcity. 
In the context of overall market conditions, Lennar's first quarter results reflect the intersection of our clearly stated strategic focus with excellent operational performance. Let me connect the dots. We have stated consistently that we would remain focused on orderly, targeted growth and maintain our sales pace tightly matched with our space of production. We actively managed growth at the top line in favor of even greater growth at the bottom line. We focused on gross margin by harvesting pricing power and controlling costs, while building a better mousetrap, as I've called it, in order to reduce our SG&A. 
We have focused on cash flow, debt reduction and stock buyback, land owned versus controlled, return on capital and on equity and, of course, innovative technologies. All of this strategic focus shows through in our first quarter results. 
We grew our deliveries 19% year-over-year and grew revenues 18%, which drove a pretax income before extraordinary items to an increase of 95% year-over-year and an after-tax pre-extraordinary items income and EPS increase of 61%. To achieve this, we've controlled sales pace and matched it with production. And while some have questioned our controlled and managed sales pace, the virtue of that strategy has been borne out by our 25% first quarter gross margin versus 20.5% last year. 
At the same time, we've remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a first quarter all-time low of 8.4% versus 9.2% last year and driving our net margin to 16.6% this year versus 11.4% last year. 
Alongside our homebuilding operations, our financial services group has continued to exceed all expectations as well. While some of the remarkable $146 million of earnings contribution from this segment is capital markets driven in today's market environment, much of the consistent performance beat from this group continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure. Lennar Financial Services continues to be a leader in the drive to create a better experience for our customers at a lower cost to transact. 
While operations have performed extremely well, we have also further improved our balance sheet. Rick will discuss our land program and our single-family for rent program, which will -- which have -- which continue to drive balance sheet improvements. And just as you've seen dramatic improvement in other facets of our business, just-in-time delivery of land and just-in-time delivery of completed homes enables us to be laser-focused on our inventory turn, and we'll be reporting on progress in that area in coming quarters. 
Of course, all of our work has strategically focused attention on our returns on equity and returns on capital, which have improved year-over-year by 470 and 420 basis points, respectively, and Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments. 
So moving on. In addition to the solid operating performance that we reported this quarter, we also had an extraordinary item of note. We have been talking about the strength of our Lennox technology platform. And this quarter, Lennox requires some additional discussion. 
Let me start by noting the remarkable contribution of Eric Feder and his team, led by Sonny Con and Christian Fok, at Lennox. We have learned from scratch how to be a constructive strategic investor in disruptive or adaptive technology companies through trial and error, together with study and engagement, and we have learned quite a lot. This group has learned how to balance both the tip of the spear and engaging best-of-breed entrepreneurs and innovators, and the soft touch required to engage and bridge change management, together with our operating leaders within the company. Great work team. 
With that said, last quarter, we daylighted that Opendoor, one of our many Lennox Technology business investments, would begin trading as a public company and would require mark-to-market gain recognition. Accordingly, Opendoor is now a public company, and we recorded a $470 million profit as a result. 
While this gain is extraordinary, relative to our operating platform, it is not a onetime event for the company. Through Lennox, we have invested in a number of high-quality technology businesses that are changing the way business is transacted in our company and in the housing business, in general. Two more of our Lennox investment companies, Doma, previously known as States Title, and Hippo Home Insurance have both announced pending SPEC combinations. Additionally, as we have recently announced, our SunStreet solar power company will be acquired by Sunnova AG. 
Given our ownership interest in these companies, and understanding that we might or might not qualify for mark-to-market accounting treatment, we are conservatively estimating an economic gain in excess of $1 billion from these companies. Additionally, we believe that other companies in our technology portfolio will mature over time as well. 
While some has questioned the heat in the technology market space, our Lennox investments are not driven by the onetime gains that might capture attention. Instead, our Lennox investments are focused on best-of-breed management teams that are building solutions to important problems that are adjacent to our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. These companies, their solutions and their form of execution, are models for us to learn, participate with and reengineer our own operating platform for improved performance. 
Our investment focus prioritizes the return to our operating platform over our outsized return on our investment. Although the gains can be sizable and positively impact our earnings and balance sheet, they are, more importantly, indicative of the maturity and relevance of the underlying management and business. And while they are subject to the up and down fluctuations of stock market movements, the part of our investment that is not subject to market fluctuations is the permanent impact to our operating platform and company performance. Each of these companies have meaningfully impacted our core operating platform. 
Let me give some examples. Opendoor pioneered the iBuyer space. We invested and participated in molding and evolving this business. We learned that the iBuyer space can reshape the entire home transaction, especially a move-up transaction. 
As this solution continues to evolve and mature, the iBuyer sale will become an industry standard as seamless, trustworthy and time for the customer's convenience becomes an expected way of transacting in the home buying world. 
For Lennar, Opendoor ignited an internal digital marketing transformation that altered our entire customer acquisition and engagement. We both learned from them, and then began to teach ourselves. We changed. And as a direct result, we significantly reduced SG&A by reducing selling, marketing and outside realtor costs and enabling better coordinated closings for us and for our purchasers. 
Doma, former States Title, is pioneering the instant digital home and mortgage closing. The conventional process of title insurance underwriting and traditional escrow closing is confusing to the customer, time-consuming for lenders and time-consuming for lenders, builders and customers alike. Doma is simply working to reduce a 14-day workstream to 14 minutes. By eliminating the traditional process, a buyer dashboard and seamless customer interface will affect an instant closing with one tap convenience. This eliminates time and risk for the lenders, reduces complexity for the customer, and reduces cost for all parties involved. 
Lennar became a shareholder in Doma by selling our retail title business for debt and equity in the company. Lennar's retail platform and title underwriter became a springboard for Doma's growth and evolution. For Lennar, we simplified, allowing our team to focus all of their attention on just our captive business. Our operation and overall operating costs will reduce significantly, helping to drive Lennar Financial Services bottom line. 
Hippo Insurance has pioneered an instant and personalized home insurance product. Home insurance historically has required a detailed application process that resulted in a one-size-fits-all overly expensive insurance policy. Hippo uses Big Data and technology to gather detailed information on each home, deliver a refined policy at a lower cost and with coverage for what matters most to the customer. 
The process is simple and frictionless. Lennar invested in Hippo by joint venturing our captive home insurance agency and investing additional dollars over time. This investment enabled us to participate in the development of the Hippo product for the new home market, add design elements to the home, like Security By Ring and Flow by Mowen water shut off valve, that lowers home insurance rates and design the engagement for the new home buyer. 
Today, Hippo underwrites every Lennar home before the purchase. Our customer simply opts in to hear from Hippo, and they will get an immediate quote. Hippo has already done all the work, Lennar participates in the agency with no overhead, and thus simplifying Lennar Financial Services once again and enhancing our bottom line. 
Finally, we have recently announced that we will sell our SunStreet solar operations to Sunnova in exchange for stock in the company. We built the SunStreet platform to install solar panels on every Lennar home in certain markets where it was feasible. We built a blue-chip team that excels at installation for production of new homes as opposed to retrofit. The SunStreet platform is readily expandable, and we expect Sunnova will effectively grow that business. 
Lennar will benefit by simplifying our business and partnering with Sunnova to take standard solar installations and turn communities into microgrids with battery storage generators and advanced arbitrage technology. We expect to develop next-generation energy solution for new homes and communities that will solve the problem of power outages and electric grid deficiencies for new communities. We look forward to working with the Sunnova team who specializes in this space to solve the critical problem of energy generation and distribution in an environmentally efficient manner. 
Simply put, Lennar is a very different company. We are no longer just a homebuilding company with technology operating in the background, we are now a focused technology aware and technology engaged homebuilder that incorporates effective and new technology solutions to enhance our core operations and our product offering. We invest in technology companies and professionals. We work alongside them to develop products for our industry. We incorporate new ways of doing business, and we profit as well by investing in world-class innovators and entrepreneurs that help illuminate our path forward. 
To the investor world, we would not make the case that a higher EPS from nonoperating income, or loss for that matter, should be used with our multiple to value our company. But instead, I would make the case and will make the case over time. For multiple expansion, as our focus on cash flow and returns, together with an improving operating platform with embedded upside from strategic investments, merits consideration. 
Now before I turn over to Rick, let me briefly turn to our ancillary business divisions and our drive to focus on our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. We have continued to drive and grow our excellent ancillary business divisions, and they continue to mature, but being simpler enables us to focus on our core business units ever more. 
As noted in past conference calls, we have been working on strategies to better position our multifamily business, called LNC, along with our now maturing SFR, or single-family for rent, business, that Rick will talk about in a minute. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing land program and land management business. We have also LMF, Lennar Mortgage Finance, our commercial mortgage business, another excellent business. And finally, we have a growing technology investment business, which is part of Lennox. 
We've concluded that the best way to enhance corporate value is to have Lennar stand-alone as a pure-play homebuilder and financial services company and to enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. Therefore, we are working to construct a tax-free spin-off of all or parts of these ongoing businesses in a unified company. This spin co may contain all or part of the assets of these businesses, together with certain land assets and programs as well as part of our Lennox investment business. 
The expected size of the spun enterprise would be between $3 billion and $5 billion in asset base, with no debt, which our balance sheet can comfortably accommodate. The remaining Lennar would see almost no loss of operating income from the spin-off, and we'll continue to have a very liquid balance sheet. This stand-alone company would ultimately drive income from significant asset management fees. 
The SpinCo will be focused on building an active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support ongoing business verticals included -- including land development. The company will become an active asset and property management company. The backbone for the company will be LNC's operating platform, together with the LND structures. 
This resolution is no longer a long-term strategy, but is immediate. As we focus on driving higher returns with less noise in our numbers from lumpy profits and losses, which will increase visibility for the capital markets into our core operation. Expect to hear a lot more about the spin over the next quarters as our thinking matures. 
Today, we can only give a brief sketch of the future of this program. I know you will thirst for more detail, but we're not in a position to give it at this time. But we did feel that it was time to share our thinking with the investment world as we work to fill out the detail and build a new company. 
So in conclusion, let me say that our results and our expectations for the year are solid in all respects, and they reflect our focused strategy to balance growth and drive bottom line margin, cash flow and returns. But complementing our business performance, we continue to be -- to focus on our broader mission of making the world around us even better. 
Whether it's with our social focus on extending home ownership to a broader social and economic array of customers with our emerging single-family for rent program, which Rick will discuss shortly, or our $1,000 per home that we contribute to our Lennar Foundation for social, health and educational programs across the country or our solar initiative for better and more sustainable energy for our homes, we are positioned to do well, but always focused on doing good. 
At Lennar, we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally, culturally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. 
With that, let me turn over to Rick."
30763,706864160,2238876,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that",1070,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. 
Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine, where we carefully match homebuilding starts with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead because you lose the ability to offset potential cost increases with sales price increases. 
Our first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy. In the quarter, both new orders and starts were up 26% over the prior year, enabling an orderly construction program and a just-in-time delivery of completed homes. This sales and production-focused program allowed us to drive a 450 basis point improvement in our gross margins year-over-year, with strong results in each month of the quarter. 
In the first quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry-level, to move-up, to our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 9.6% in the quarter, down 450 basis points from last year. 
This is additional evidence that buyers have the required down payment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home, and they have little desire to risk canceling their new home purchase due to the risk of rising sales prices. 
As Stuart mentioned, technology-driven innovation and a focus on process has significantly lowered our SG&A. This has been reflected in each of our operating regions with net margins up across the board in every region. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. As expected, our community count at the end of the first quarter was down 8% from the prior year. Notwithstanding the 8% decline, we achieved a 26% increase in new orders in the first quarter, driven by a 45% increase in sales per community. While part of the increase in absorption pace was driven by improved market conditions, part of it was due to the fact that we have been targeting larger, higher volume entry-level communities that can deliver more homes per month than smaller communities. 
In the next several quarters, our growth will continue to come from an overall higher absorption phase as well as an increase in community count, and we are still on track to increase our active communities by about 10% in fiscal 2021, with the increase coming in the back half of the year. 
While we continue to be focused on our community count, we are intensely focused on replacing our existing communities with larger, higher volume communities as this allows us to better leverage our overhead, improve our bottom line and increase our returns and cash flow. 
As I've mentioned on prior calls, improving our returns on capital and reducing our balance sheet -- our on-balance sheet investment in land is a top priority. With that in mind, we have been laser-focused on increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our year supply of owned homesites, all while increasing our overall home site supply. 
During the first quarter, we made significant process on all of these fronts, as our controlled homesite percentage increased 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially to end the first quarter at 45%. In addition, our years owned supply of homesites dropped to 3.4 years from 4 years in the year ago period and 3.5 years sequentially. Most importantly, we increased our total controlled and owned homesites by approximately 37,000 homesites in the quarter, with approximately 95% of these being optioned or controlled homesites. Based on this progress, we are in excellent position to achieve our goals of 50% controlled homesites and a 3-year owned supply by the end of fiscal 2021. 
These improvements reflect the strength of our relationships with local developers and other strategic partners. We've been building a just-in-time delivery system for our land inventory, that we believe is sustainable throughout the cycles. We've created relationships with developers and investors with appetites for different duration of risk for land, and have matched that duration risk with appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These short-term land and long-term land programs will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, while generating strong margins and increased returns on capital. 
Consistent with our land light strategy and a focus on increased profitability and returns, we are excited to expand our business through the creation of a first-of-its-kind single-family rental platform that will facilitate a better time delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times. Following this earnings call, we will formally announce the formation of the upward America venture. This business will initially be capitalized with a total equity commitment of $1.25 billion, led by Centerbridge Partners, alongside Allianz Real Estate and other high-quality institutional investors. Including leverage, the venture will be positioned to acquire over $4 billion of new single-family homes and townhomes from Lennar. We expect Lennar's peak capital investment to be $50 million in the Upward America venture. This venture is uniquely positioned to quickly scale, given its direct access to Lennar's pipeline of both purpose-built single-family communities and scattered single-family homes, that meet the venture's investment criteria. The initial pipeline of purpose-built communities for this venture includes approximately 3,000 homes in 27 communities, with a total purchase price of approximately $900 million. 
Like our multifamily build to core business, this platform will be asset managed by Lennar, with third-party equity and debt on the assets in an asset-light program for Lennar. As housing needs and demographics continue to evolve, we believe that the single-family rental sector will continue to outperform. 
In addition, the Upward America venture continues Lennar's vision of becoming an ESG-driven homebuilding company. By making our high-quality homes not only available for sale but also for rent, with the portion of the homes available with a rent-to-own option. The vehicle social focus provides a unique opportunity for family and individuals across the country to live in brand-new Lennar homes, at an attainable price point, all without putting up a down payment. Given this, we have a distinct opportunity to create upward mobility in the housing market through this initiative. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon."

As Rick and Stuart noted, matching sales pace with our production pace has been our consistent strategic focus that has enabled us to drive excellent performance.

As Rick and Stuart noted, matching sales pace with our production pace has been our consistent strategic focus that has enabled us to drive excellent performance. By pairing production and sales, we've maximized margins and driven bottom line profitability. 
In the current environment, we could have easily generated more sales, but our view has been and remains that the key to success in this market is all about managing the supply chain and production. I'd like to briefly describe our strategy, performance and expectations for production and construction costs in order to shed some light on how this strategy has been central to our accomplishments this quarter and how it impact the balance of 2021. 
First, let me share with you some statistics from our first quarter. Our total construction cost per square foot was down 0.7% in Q1 year-over-year, but up 1.9% sequentially from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, lumber costs increased about $1 per square foot or $2,300 per home, both year-over-year and sequentially. These cost increases were more than offset by other cost decreases year-over-year, but not sequentially, resulting in the overall year-over-year cost decline and sequential cost increase. 
Year-over-year, our construction cost, as a percent of average sales price, decreased from 45% to 42% and remained flat sequentially as our pricing power, driven by our controlled sales pace, offset cost increases seen in our first quarter deliveries. 
Let me take a moment to discuss the situation of lumber and other supply chain challenges. As we all know, lumber is the largest component -- largest cost component of new home construction. It is well documented that the cost of lumber is at all-time high, and supply is limited and demand is high. We will see additional cost increases from lumber throughout the year, with increases from today's all-time high lumber pricing starting with Q3 deliveries. 
Given the unprecedented pricing levels we've seen, it's challenging to predict how lumber prices will trend. But we're encouraged by the additional OSB capacity currently coming online, and the lumber future market indicating some relief. The overall production environment today is defined by a supply chain limited to no excess inventory. Normally, the manufacturers that supply our industry carry 30 to 60 days of inventory and are able to adjust distribution to meet varying demand. However, due to COVID-19 disruptions and manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and overseas in 2020, that capacity has, at best, dramatically reduced and at worst, eliminated. At the same time, demand has increased from both new home construction and big box retailers. 
This situation makes the supply chain particularly vulnerable to further disruptions, such as the deep freeze that shut Texas last month. That storm shut down the plants that manufacture MDI and poly-based resins, impacting the manufacturing of OSB, paint, insulation, refrigerators and other products. We're working closely with all of these effective manufacturers to ensure that we have the products we need being delivered to our job sites as we need them. 
To manage for these disruptions in the supply chain of materials as well as to be the builder of choice in a continually constrained labor market, we employ the following strategies and processes. First, we remain disciplined about our Everything's Included approach, which simplifies the entire building process for our trades. We shared data by providing frequent forecast an open purchase order information. We simplified by rationalizing SKUs across multiple categories. We access alternative supply chain solutions and aggressively prebuy materials as needed. 
Most importantly, we communicate. Our trade partners are well in advance of our upcoming production needs. Our divisions know the extended manufacturing lead times in real-time and our national supply chain team, led by Ken Gillis, together with our retail purchasing VPs, are in constant communication with each other, our divisions and all of our trade partners. 
I would best describe the production environment as challenged, but manageable. In the first quarter, we saw a mild increase in our cycle time as we dealt with resolving issues as they presented themselves. And through our strong supply chain partnerships, we were largely able to overcome supply constraints. Our highest volume partners have given us expanded lead times, which we were able to accommodate due to our production first model, where our needs are forecasted several quarters out. We believe we're well positioned with our disciplined and production first process to continue to manage through new challenges as they present themselves. Our focus on these processes is why we are comfortable affirming our deliveries for the year. 
However, this environment is not easily stressed to allow for an increase in deliveries. So our focus is on maintaining our planned starts, deliveries and maximizing margins. 
In conclusion, Lennar's strategy of a managed approach to production and sales pace produced great results in our first quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we're confident that our gross margins will remain around 25% and will drive our SG&A lower, producing higher net margins and a stronger bottom line, while maintaining our planned volume. 
And now I'll turn it over to Diane."

Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain of our 2021 highlights, and then provide detailed guidance for Q2 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
So we'll start with homebuilding. For new orders, we ended the quarter with new orders of 15,570, a 26% increase year-over-year. While this was the highest new order total for a quarter in our history, we continued to be focused on production first, matching sales and starts. 
In the first quarter, our starts were 15,982, also up 26% year-over-year. From a pace standpoint, our monthly sales pace was 4.5 for the quarter, matching our monthly start pace of 4.6 for the quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,077 homes in backlog, with a dollar value of $9.5 billion and ended with 1,162 active communities. Our cancellation rate was about 10%. 
For the quarter, deliveries totaled 12,314, up 19% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 25%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on attaining price increases, while controlling and matching cost increases. 
In addition, we also had lower interest expense per home as a result of our continued pay downs of senior notes in the past several years and lower field expense per home due to a higher delivery line. Our SG&A was 8.4%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. This improvement is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform. 
Our net margin for the quarter was 16.6%, the highest first quarter net margin ever achieved. Our Financial Services team also executed at high levels, reporting $146 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $100 million compared to $41 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited primarily from an increase in volume and lower cost per loan, combined with an increase in secondary margins. 
Total operating earnings was $31 million compared to $10 million in the prior year. Total earnings increased primarily due to an increase in volume. We also started to realize upside from our strategic technology investments in our Lennar other segment. As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a $470 million mark-to-market gain on our Opendoor investment as a result of the company going public in December. The gain was based on Opendoor's stock price at the end of our first quarter, which was 2,802. This investment will be mark-to-market at each quarter end based on Opendoor's stock price at that time. 
I also want to mention that we have a new line item on our P&L, titled, Charitable Foundation Contribution, which is the contribution to our Lennar Foundation. Previously, our annual contribution to the foundation was 1% of net income. Beginning with this year, 2021, we will be increasing our contribution to $1,000 per home delivery. 
And so just for a bit of perspective, using fiscal 2020 numbers, our net income last year was about $2.5 billion, which resulted in a contribution of about $25 million. If we had contributed at $1,000 per home level, our contribution would have been about $53 million. So the increase is significant, and we are very pleased and very proud to be able to give back even more to our communities, doing good while we do well. 
And then turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating increased homebuilding cash flow. At quarter end, we owned 189,000 homesites and controlled 154,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned, decreasing to 3.4 years from 4.0 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increasing to 45% from 31% in the prior year. We continue to make progress, as Rick mentioned, in reaching our goal of 3-year supply owned and 50% of homesites controlled by the end of the year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased a small amount of shares, 510,000, for a total of 43 million. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 24%, down from 33.6% in the prior year. 
And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $19 billion from $16 billion in Q1 of the prior year. And our book value per share increased to $60.30 from $51.39 in the prior year. 
And finally, just a few weeks ago, we were upgraded by Fitch to BBB flat from BBB-. This upgrade follows the upgrade to investment-grade from Moody's that we received last November. We are quite pleased with the rating agency advances that we have achieved in recent months. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong. This balance sheet enables us to execute a spinoff. And even after that transaction, we will have a rock-solid balance sheet. 
And with that brief overview, let's turn to guidance. I'll first provide detailed guidance for the second quarter, and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. So we'll start with homebuilding. 
We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 16,500 to 16,700 homes, and our Q2 deliveries will be in the range of 14,200 to 14,400 homes. Our Q2 average sales price should be around $405,000. As we mentioned, we expect to maintain our gross margin at about 25% for Q2, despite rising material and labor costs. We expect our Q2 SG&A to be in the range of 7.9% to 8%, as we continue to focus on benefiting from technology efficiencies. 
And for the combined category of homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other, we expect a Q2 loss in the range of about $5 million to $10 million. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q2 will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. For our multifamily operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. And so the Lennar other category, we also expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. 
Now remember that this guidance for Lennar Other does not include any potential mark-to-market gains on our Hippo or States Title Doma investment. We have not yet concluded if we will be able to utilize mark-to-market accounting for these investments. And if we do, the gain will be determined by the stock price of each company at the end of our second quarter. 
Additionally, this guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our current Opendoor investments since this 2 will be determined by the stock price of Opendoor at the end of our second quarter. And lastly, the guidance does not include a gain related to the sale of our SunStreet Solar company, since the shares that we will receive as consideration will be valued at Sunnova's closing price on the day that the transaction closes. 
We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenue. And as I mentioned, our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered during the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 311 million shares. 
And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share for the quarter. And so now let me provide some guidance for the fiscal year. 
We still expect to deliver between 62,064 homes, but with now higher gross margin guidance of about 25% for the year, and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.6% to 7.8% for the year. And we believe our average sales price for the year will be about $400,000. And our financial services earnings will be in the range of $445 million to $460 million. And finally, our tax rate should be about 24%. 
And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a very strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for another excellent year. 
And so with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions."

So first question on the gross margin guidance, you all bumped it up to 25%. That implies flat sequentially throughout the year when normally we see sequential improvement due to leverage as we move through the year. Could you just let us know what your expectations are for land, labor, material inflation is as we move through the year? And does this imply -- since it's flat gross margin through the year, does this imply that some of your internal efficiencies are starting to level off or pricing you assume is cooling?

But just remember, Truman, that our guidance on margin was pretty consistent through the year at between 23.5% to 24-ish percent. And so we're upping our guidance. It was flat through the year, recognizing that along the way and through the year, some of the construction costs would rise and would pull-through at different parts of the year. 
So this is consistent with how we were thinking at the beginning of the year in terms of the way the year would shape up, even with, as you say, the leverage embedded in increased volume as you go quarter-by-quarter. So what you're seeing is significant improvement that we're reflecting in each quarter's results.

That will go up by about another 4,000 or 5,000 per home as we move into Q2. And then in Q3 and Q4, we'll see a repeat of that pattern as lumber prices moved higher in the recent months before what we hope will be an expected leveling off. 
So all of us have mentioned, we've got significant pricing power that's overcoming that big needle mover of the lumber cost increases, that's just a reflection of where the lumber market is. Not something that any of us can do anything about until the market itself corrects. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing other cost increases, other categories. There is supply constraint and increased demand. So natural supply and demand that's occurring in the supply chain."

I did want to ask you generally, though, about Lennox, which I understand is Len2x power. But I see 2 potential approaches and I'm curious, which is more the priority for you, which is really more the emphasis that is sort of driving your decision-making or will drive your decision-making around Lennox. 
One would be to create a separate operating segment of sorts in order to have a collection of businesses be more easily valuable by the street, literally able to be valued more easily. But then another alternative would be that you want to create an ecosystem. An ecosystem of tech-enabled businesses that a customer enters into when they walk into one of your sales centers or one of your rental offices, in order to sort of maximize the value that you can both provide and get compensated for by that customer. And I'm wondering, which was more the priority -- or is more of the priority in your mind? And then as a follow-up, do we consider -- should we consider these initiatives to be cash flow positive or negative meaningfully over the next few years at all?"

Our primary focus in building Lenox, and it has been evolutionary, has been the latter approach. It was and continues to be all about -- in the background of our core business, we inject these new streams of activity that are enabling a better customer experience and better cost structure for our company. I've called it and said it's building a better mousetrap. 
And if you think about the companies we've talked about over time, you could imagine that a customer walks in and says, I've got a home to sell. We've got a solution. It's the iBuyer space. And that leads right into a blend powered mortgage application, which is a seamless, simpler technology-enabled mortgage application feeding right into Doma and the entire closing process being one tap and digitized and an immediate home insurance policy, it becomes a joyful experience with our technology companies operating in the background creating an excellent experience for our customer, but driving our cost structure down and enabling us to build profitability and even pass on some of those savings to our customers, which is a greater good. 
And I haven't really mentioned that each of our technology companies has an ESG component and focus as well, and that will develop over time. So really think about it as we're building a better Lennar by investing in these technology companies and the investment in the technology company we're not really isolating and looking at as a separate operating business, and I would -- I just want to daylight that Eric Feder and his team of Sonicone, Christian [indiscernible] and a number of others have really developed some expertise in creating a focus on technology companies that matter, together with change management, dovetailed within the company. 
And I think that, over time, what you're going to see as these companies develop their own value proposition, as you've already started to see, they do become cash flow positive in their own right, and each of them has a map to that strategy. And the dovetail with Lennar and the operating performance is what gets us very enthusiastic. So we're more focused on the latter approach than we are on the former. And we really want to deemphasize what I call the shiny object of the big gains, and I want to emphasize more the core programs that Rick is involved in. Jon is involved in, Eric is involved. I'm involved in every single day of building a better company. That's what it's really about."

The second thing I wanted to ask about relates to this land venture, which you talked a little bit about in your 10-K, and you talked a little bit about today.

In a way, though, that's kind of what you've always been doing, right? I mean, like homebuilders always -- what they're doing things properly are sort of evaluating parcels of land for duration and returns on capital expectations and so forth.

We have always done what we thought we could do to maximize the land opportunities out there, whether they be short-term or long term. 
I think the key difference associated with this is we've created something that's very programmatic and systemized and oriented, where we're matching capital and returns to either short-dated and long-dated land opportunities. And what we've learned as we've evolved our thinking over the last several years is that there is tremendous appetite out there in the market for risk-adjusted returns. And the returns associated with the short-term sort of current inventory type of opportunity is a much lower threshold than something that is a little bit riskier. 
And by creating a programmatic systemized machine, where we funnel our land opportunities to either one of these programmatic structures, it allows us to become very efficient and to really incredibly scour the land opportunities out there to grow our business. 
So Jon, anything you want to add to that?"

So if you think about the lease risky component, that's the land in which we're building a home zone. And that should really be financed at the lowest cost of capital, primarily our cash on hand or revolver. 
And then if you look at the next bucket and call it the land that is more like with that's ready to come into that production assembly line that's from, say, 0 to 4 years out. That is properly structured relatively very low-risk and should attract the cost of capital that is also very low and separated from sort of that midterm bucket of land, which has historically looked for high teens to 20% kind of returns from an investment standpoint. 
And by properly structuring and really reducing the significant portion of risk associated with that middle bucket we're able to create, as Rick said, a -- more of a systemic approach about a significant size and scale to it, allowing for us a one-stop facility to be able to make it very easy to transact and to really position land to be de-risked."

There's no question that stimulus is a significant part of the equation as we've noted in my remarks, interest rates are still low by all measures. Yes, they've ticked up a little bit. But the other side of the equation is the savings rate and the stimulus that's out there just in the most recent stimulus bill. Additional legislation seems to be coming down the track, and that will, once again, stimulate even more demand. 
The complicating part is that we're dealing more with supply shortage than we are dealing with a shortage of demand. The fact is demand is very, very strong. And a tax credit to stimulate more demand, it seems as probably going to layer on more demand to an already constrained supply, which will probably have the impact of raising prices somewhat, just supply and demand imbalance. 
So the question is what do you do across the country that is talking about workforce housing and short supply, as a governing kind of component, and it seems that there's going to have to be some additional initiative to focus on more land entitlement more streamlined government involvement and constraining the supply, but we'll have to see how it all shakes out. 
As things sit right now, when we look at the housing market, it's one of the reasons that we think that for the next years, the housing market benefits from a fairly strong supply limitation and demand strength -- strong demand and shorter supply.

Stuart, and team, obviously, appreciate all the detail and the results. I wanted to ask 2 quick questions. One, operationally, on the homebuilding side and one, see if there's any way to squeeze out a couple more numbers on the spin. 
On the sales pace side, in particular, you guys have been very consistent in your approach to managing pace and where possible perhaps getting a little bit more on the margin side. And I think that strategy really comes home in an environment today, where rates are rising, which everything else equal, would lower the true, what I'm kind of referring to recently, is theoretical level of demand. Because certainly, as you've said, your sales pace is below that level, you could run a lot hotter if you choose. 
And so in that type of dynamic, you would think that if rates going higher, impair overall market demand, but you're running below that, you should be able to still maintain a pretty steady business and a pretty steady order inflow. So obviously, we're just in the initial stages of this rate rise, but I was wondering if that theory is accurate in that over the last -- throughout the first quarter, particularly February and into March, given again that you could have run a lot hotter, and in other words, below true market demand, that the recent move-in rates really hasn't impacted you at all from the order cadence?"

But in today's market, as I've noted, there are offsets to the movement in interest rates. First of all, interest rates have -- are moving from a historically abnormally low rate. We're still lower than we were 1 year ago. Interest rates are still low. But the offset is the fact that the savings rate in the country has really enabled so many more people to be able to afford a down payment. 
The increase in home prices is, on the one hand, a negative, but on the other hand, a positive in that someone who owns a home, who's going to sell their first-time home has a bigger down payment for their move-up home. 
So there's this kind of trickle up portion of this. And then stimulus is adding to the availability of capital to support the home and mortgage business. You might find that interest rates knock some people out of the credit boxes that are out there. But there's so much demand. The backfill has been pretty readily supportive of maintaining sales pace. So at the end of the day, we've really seen very little trail off in demand. 
In fact, it's continued to be strong and be building what has been traditionally a spring selling season. It's hard to detect where the spring selling season is because we've been consistently strong all the way through what, at this time, should be the beginning of the spring selling season. 
So I think that what I'd say is that we're still seeing a very strong demand pattern. And even with interest rates ticking up, there are offsets to that tick up that are keeping demand strong."

I think one of the key numbers, I guess, was that this tax-free spend could be comprised of $3 billion to $5 billion in assets with no debt. And you mentioned, obviously, the different businesses that would, from which the spin could be comprised of with LMC being the backbone, I was hoping if it's possible, if you kind of take that $3 billion to $5 billion asset range, what would be the corresponding range for liabilities? And also on the income statement side, any type of corresponding management fees or income that you're deriving from today that's running through your income statement as well as on the corporate G&A side? So I don't know if you could give perhaps all those numbers, but even a few would be very helpful."

I think that, my starting point and just giving you some answer to that, is we start with a really strong balance sheet right now. You see a debt to total cap at 24%, and sizable profitability coming through the year. So you can imagine, our balance sheet continues to get stronger. 
That really enables us to do a spin of a sizable amount of assets with no liabilities associated, meaning no debt. And it leaves us with a balance sheet at Lennar that is just rock solid. So very little impact to the balance sheet. 
Now from an operating and earnings standpoint, you can think similarly. Look, we've been building these businesses in the background, and we've been reporting on them for years. These businesses are up running and have been operating. But because of the composition of some of them, like LMC, where you have depreciation and you have third-party management fees and a variety of things, they don't show GAAP profitability. So there's the -- that's right. 
You're going to see very little, if any, impact to the earnings of the core company. But these operating businesses, as they stand on their own with their own identified metrics, this enables those businesses to be able to run more effectively and efficiently as a stand-alone company. This is not about creating some notion of value or anything else, the stand-alone Homebuilding Financial Services group and the stand-alone asset management business is the right configuration for these businesses on a go-forward basis. And you'll see very little impact to Lennar, the remainco bottom line. And an exciting value proposition and stand-alone enterprise for Spinco as it stands on its own. 
That's the structure. That's the skeleton. It's as far as we can go right now, but all of this is driven by the fact that we have a balance sheet that supports. We can give this kind of a strong spin or dividend, as you might think of it, without impacting the underlying balance sheet and building 2 or furthering 2 very strong companies on a go-forward basis. 
And I would just say, Mike, as you think about this, remember, Lennar has done this before. In 1997, we spun L&R. And we did it in a very carefully constructive manner where it was 2 separate businesses that were long-standing, and we identified and ran both companies in a very successful manner, and we expect to be doing some of that similarly all over again. 
Listen, I know that this has been a lot to absorb, and we've run over time, but I thought it was worth the time to do that. We look forward to continuing to update you on all elements of our business, and look forward to a strong 2021. Thank you for joining."

Demand has continued to strengthen as the millennial generation, which had previously postponed its entry into the housing market, has now continued to drive family formation, while at the same time, the supply of new and existing homes remains constrained. Even though interest rates have moved higher, at the same time that home prices have moved higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and personal savings for deposits are strengthening. 
Many American families have fortified savings, as vacations and recreational activities have been canceled or postponed, and stimulus money from the government continues to fill the remaining gaps. The American dream of homeownership is an essential aspiration of the American population and the seemingly imminent resolution of the pandemic is not slowing the growing demand. 
Apartment dwellers can today afford a first-time home, and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling quickly, end at higher prices, enabling first-time move ups. The market for yesterday's move-up home is strong and enabling customers to consider and purchase a larger home with a larger yard, with an office, a nicer kitchen and a new set of necessary spaces for an evolving market. 
Also, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to sell and purchase homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transactions. The underproduction of homes for the past 10 years has created a housing shortage. And with strong demand, home prices are moving higher. 
Although this reality is exacerbating the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, as workforce housing is limited and getting more expensive, the solution it seems will be in the growing supply by -- will be in growing supply by building more housing. 
Current conditions have given rise to strong pricing power, strong, though controlled sales pace, certainly, labor and material increases, very strong gross margins and even stronger net margins and, of course, the challenge of land scarcity. 
In the context of overall market conditions, Lennar's first quarter results reflect the intersection of our clearly stated strategic focus with excellent operational performance. Let me connect the dots. We have stated consistently that we would remain focused on orderly, targeted growth and maintain our sales pace tightly matched with our space of production. We actively managed growth at the top line in favor of even greater growth at the bottom line. We focused on gross margin by harvesting pricing power and controlling costs, while building a better mousetrap, as I've called it, in order to reduce our SG&A. 
We have focused on cash flow, debt reduction and stock buyback, land owned versus controlled, return on capital and on equity and, of course, innovative technologies. All of this strategic focus shows through in our first quarter results. 
We grew our deliveries 19% year-over-year and grew revenues 18%, which drove a pretax income before extraordinary items to an increase of 95% year-over-year and an after-tax, pre-extraordinary items income and EPS increase of 61%. To achieve this, we've controlled sales pace and matched it with production. And while some have questioned our controlled and managed sales pace, the virtue of that strategy has been borne out by our 25% first quarter gross margin versus 20.5% last year. 
At the same time, we've remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a first quarter all-time low of 8.4% versus 9.2% last year and driving our net margin to 16.6% this year versus 11.4% last year. 
Alongside our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services group has continued to exceed all expectations as well. While some of the remarkable $146 million of earnings contribution from this segment is capital markets driven in today's market environment, much of the consistent performance beat from this group continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure. Lennar Financial Services continues to be a leader in the drive to create a better experience for our customers at a lower cost to transact. 
While operations have performed extremely well, we have also further improved our balance sheet. Rick will discuss our land program and our single-family for rent program, which will -- which have -- which continue to drive balance sheet improvements. And just as you've seen dramatic improvement in other facets of our business, just-in-time delivery of land and just-in-time delivery of completed homes enables us to be laser-focused on our inventory turn, and we'll be reporting on progress in that area in coming quarters. 
Of course, all of our work has strategically focused attention on our returns on equity and returns on capital, which have improved year-over-year by 470 and 420 basis points, respectively, and Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments. 
So moving on. In addition to the solid operating performance that we reported this quarter, we also had an extraordinary item of note. We have been talking about the strength of our LENx technology platform. And this quarter, LENx requires some additional discussion. 
Let me start by noting the remarkable contribution of Eric Feder and his team, led by Sana Khan and Christian Falk, at LENx. We have learned from scratch how to be a constructive strategic investor in disruptive or adaptive technology companies through trial and error, together with study and engagement, and we have learned quite a lot. This group has learned how to balance both the tip of the spear and engaging best-of-breed entrepreneurs and innovators, and the soft touch required to engage and bridge change management, together with our operating leaders within the company. Great work, team. 
With that said, last quarter, we daylighted that Opendoor, one of our many LENx technology business investments, would begin trading as a public company and would require mark-to-market gain recognition. Accordingly, Opendoor is now a public company, and we recorded a $470 million profit as a result. 
While this gain is extraordinary, relative to our operating platform, it is not a onetime event for the company. Through LENx, we have invested in a number of high-quality technology businesses that are changing the way business is transacted in our company and in the housing business, in general. Two more of our LENx investment companies, Doma, previously known as States Title, and Hippo home insurance have both announced pending spec combinations. Additionally, as we have recently announced, our SunStreet solar power company will be acquired by Sunnova Energy. 
Given our ownership interest in these companies, and understanding that we might or might not qualify for mark-to-market accounting treatment, we are conservatively estimating an economic gain in excess of $1 billion from these companies. Additionally, we believe that other companies in our technology portfolio will mature over time as well. 
While some has questioned the heat in the technology market space, our LENx investments are not driven by the onetime gains that might capture attention. Instead, our LENx investments are focused on best-of-breed management teams that are building solutions to important problems that are adjacent to our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. These companies, their solutions and their form of execution, are models for us to learn, participate with and reengineer our own operating platform for improved performance. 
Our investment focus prioritizes the return to our operating platform over our outsized return on our investment. Although the gains can be sizable and positively impact our earnings and balance sheet, they are, more importantly, indicative of the maturity and relevance of the underlying management and business. And while they are subject to the up and down fluctuations of stock market movements, the part of our investment that is not subject to market fluctuations is the permanent impact to our operating platform and company performance. Each of these companies have meaningfully impacted our core operating platform. 
Let me give some examples. Opendoor pioneered the iBuyer space. We invested and participated in molding and evolving this business. We learned that the iBuyer space can reshape the entire home transaction, especially a move-up transaction. 
As this solution continues to evolve and mature, the iBuyer sale will become an industry standard as seamless, trustworthy and timed for the customer's convenience becomes an expected way of transacting in the homebuying world. 
For Lennar, Opendoor ignited an internal digital marketing transformation that altered our entire customer acquisition and engagement. We both learned from them, and then began to teach ourselves. We changed. And as a direct result, we significantly reduced SG&A by reducing selling, marketing and outside realtor costs and enabling better coordinated closings for us and for our purchasers. 
Doma, formerly States Title, is pioneering the instant digital home and mortgage closing. The conventional process of title insurance underwriting and traditional escrow closing is confusing to the customer, time-consuming for lenders and time-consuming for lenders, builders and customers alike. Doma is simply working to reduce a 14-day work stream to 14 minutes. By eliminating the traditional process, a buyer dashboard and seamless customer interface will affect an instant closing with one-tap convenience. This eliminates time and risk for the lenders, reduces complexity for the customer, and reduces cost for all parties involved. 
Lennar became a shareholder in Doma by selling our retail title business for debt and equity in the company. Lennar's retail platform and title underwriter became a springboard for Doma's growth and evolution. For Lennar, we simplified, allowing our team to focus all of their attention on just our captive business. Our operation and overall operating costs will reduce significantly, helping to drive Lennar Financial Services bottom line. 
Hippo Insurance has pioneered an instant and personalized home insurance product. Home insurance historically has required a detailed application process that resulted in a one-size-fits-all overly expensive insurance policy. Hippo uses Big Data and technology to gather detailed information on each home, deliver a refined policy at a lower cost and with coverage for what matters most to the customer. 
The process is simple and frictionless. Lennar invested in Hippo by joint venturing our captive home insurance agency and investing additional dollars over time. This investment enabled us to participate in the development of the Hippo product for the new home market, add design elements to the home, like Security by Ring and Flo by Moen water shutoff valve, that lowers home insurance rates and design the engagement for the new homebuyer. 
Today, Hippo underwrites every Lennar home before the purchase. Our customer simply opts in to hear from Hippo, and they will get an immediate quote. Hippo has already done all the work, Lennar participates in the agency with no overhead, and thus simplifying Lennar Financial Services once again and enhancing our bottom line. 
Finally, we have recently announced that we will sell our SunStreet solar operations to Sunnova in exchange for stock in the company. We built the SunStreet platform to install solar panels on every Lennar home in certain markets where it was feasible. We built a blue-chip team that excels at installation for production of new homes as opposed to retrofit. The SunStreet platform is readily expandable, and we expect Sunnova will effectively grow that business. 
Lennar will benefit by simplifying our business and partnering with Sunnova to take standard solar installations and turn communities into microgrids with battery storage generators and advanced arbitrage technology. We expect to develop next-generation energy solution for new homes and communities that will solve the problem of power outages and electric grid deficiencies for new communities. We look forward to working with the Sunnova team who specializes in this space to solve the critical problem of energy generation and distribution in an environmentally efficient manner. 
Simply put, Lennar is a very different company. We are no longer just a homebuilding company with technology operating in the background, we are now a focused technology-aware and technology-engaged homebuilder that incorporates effective and new technology solutions to enhance our core operations and our product offering. We invest in technology companies and professionals. We work alongside them to develop products for our industry. We incorporate new ways of doing business, and we profit as well by investing in world-class innovators and entrepreneurs that help illuminate our path forward. 
To the investor world, we would not make the case that a higher EPS from nonoperating income, or loss for that matter, should be used with our multiple to value our company. But instead, I would make the case and will make the case over time. For multiple expansion, as our focus on cash flow and returns, together with an improving operating platform with embedded upside from strategic investments, merits consideration. 
Now before I turn over to Rick, let me briefly turn to our ancillary business decisions and our drive to focus on our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. We have continued to drive and grow our excellent ancillary business divisions, and they continue to mature, but being simpler enables us to focus on our core business units ever more. 
As noted in past conference calls, we have been working on strategies to better position our multifamily business, called LMC, along with our now maturing SFR, or single-family for rent, business, that Rick will talk about in a minute. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing land program and land management business. We have also LMF, Lennar Mortgage Finance, our commercial mortgage business, another excellent business. And finally, we have a growing technology investment business, which is part of LENx. 
We've concluded that the best way to enhance corporate value is to have Lennar stand-alone as a pure-play homebuilder and financial services company and to enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. Therefore, we are working to construct a tax-free spin-off of all or parts of these ongoing businesses in a unified company. This spinco may contain all or part of the assets of these businesses, together with certain land assets and programs as well as part of our LENx investment business. 
The expected size of the spun enterprise would be between $3 billion and $5 billion in asset base, with no debt, which our balance sheet can comfortably accommodate. The remaining Lennar would see almost no loss of operating income from the spin-off, and we'll continue to have a very liquid balance sheet. This stand-alone company would ultimately drive income from significant asset management fees. 
The spinco will be focused on building an active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support ongoing business verticals included -- including land development. The company will become an active asset and property management company. The backbone for the company will be LMC's operating platform, together with the LNV structures. 
This resolution is no longer a long-term strategy, but is immediate. As we focus on driving higher returns with less noise in our numbers from lumpy profits and losses, which will increase visibility for the capital markets into our core operation. Expect to hear a lot more about the spin over the next quarters as our thinking matures. 
Today, we can only give a brief sketch of the future of this program. I know you will thirst for more detail, but we're not in a position to give it at this time. But we did feel that it was time to share our thinking with the investment world as we work to fill out the detail and build a new company. 
So in conclusion, let me say that our results and our expectations for the year are solid in all respects, and they reflect our focused strategy to balance growth and drive bottom line margin, cash flow and returns. But complementing our business performance, we continue to be -- to focus on our broader mission of making the world around us even better. 
Whether it's with our social focus on extending homeownership to a broader social and economic array of customers with our emerging single-family for rent program, which Rick will discuss shortly, or our $1,000 per home that we contribute to our Lennar Foundation for social, health and educational programs across the country or our solar initiative for better and more sustainable energy for our homes, we are positioned to do well, but always focused on doing good. 
At Lennar, we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally, culturally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. 
With that, let me turn over to Rick."
30763,706864160,2238998,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 17, 2021",2021-03-17,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that",1068,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. 
Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine, where we carefully match homebuilding starts with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead because you lose the ability to offset potential cost increases with sales price increases. 
Our first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy. In the quarter, both new orders and starts were up 26% over the prior year, enabling an orderly construction program and a just-in-time delivery of completed homes. This sales and production-focused program allowed us to drive a 450 basis point improvement in our gross margins year-over-year, with strong results in each month of the quarter. 
In the first quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry-level, to move-up, to our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 9.6% in the quarter, down 450 basis points from last year. 
This is additional evidence that buyers have the required down payment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home, and they have little desire to risk canceling their new home purchase due to the risk of rising sales prices. 
As Stuart mentioned, technology-driven innovation and a focus on process has significantly lowered our SG&A. This has been reflected in each of our operating regions with net margins up across the board in every region. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. As expected, our community count at the end of the first quarter was down 8% from the prior year. Notwithstanding the 8% decline, we achieved a 26% increase in new orders in the first quarter, driven by a 45% increase in sales per community. While part of the increase in absorption pace was driven by improved market conditions, part of it was due to the fact that we have been targeting larger, higher-volume entry-level communities that can deliver more homes per month than smaller communities. 
In the next several quarters, our growth will continue to come from an overall higher absorption phase as well as an increase in community count, and we are still on track to increase our active communities by about 10% in fiscal 2021, with the increase coming in the back half of the year. 
While we continue to be focused on our community count, we are intensely focused on replacing our existing communities with larger, higher volume communities as this allows us to better leverage our overhead, improve our bottom line and increase our returns and cash flow. 
As I've mentioned on prior calls, improving our returns on capital and reducing our balance sheet -- our on-balance sheet investment in land is a top priority. With that in mind, we have been laser-focused on increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our year supply of owned home sites, all while increasing our overall homesite supply. 
During the first quarter, we made significant process on all of these fronts, as our controlled homesite percentage increased 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially to end the first quarter at 45%. In addition, our years owned supply of homesites dropped to 3.4 years from 4 years in the year ago period and 3.5 years sequentially. Most importantly, we increased our total controlled and owned homesites by approximately 37,000 homesites in the quarter, with approximately 95% of these being optioned or controlled homesites. Based on this progress, we are in excellent position to achieve our goals of 50% controlled homesites and a 3-year owned supply by the end of fiscal 2021. 
These improvements reflect the strength of our relationships with local developers and other strategic partners. We've been building a just-in-time delivery system for our land inventory, that we believe is sustainable throughout the cycles. We've created relationships with developers and investors with appetites for different duration of risk for land, and have matched that duration risk with appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These short-term land and long-term land programs will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, while generating strong margins and increased returns on capital. 
Consistent with our land-light strategy and a focus on increased profitability and returns, we are excited to expand our business through the creation of a first-of-its-kind, single-family rental platform that will facilitate a better time delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times. Following this earnings call, we will formally announce the formation of the Upward America Venture. This business will initially be capitalized with a total equity commitment of $1.25 billion, led by Centerbridge Partners, alongside Allianz Real Estate and other high-quality institutional investors. 
Including leverage, the venture will be positioned to acquire over $4 billion of new single-family homes and townhomes from Lennar. We expect Lennar's peak capital investment to be $50 million in the Upward America Venture. This venture is uniquely positioned to quickly scale, given its direct access to Lennar's pipeline of both purpose-built single-family communities and scattered single-family homes, that meet the venture's investment criteria. The initial pipeline of purpose-built communities for this venture includes approximately 3,000 homes in 27 communities, with a total purchase price of approximately $900 million. 
Like our multifamily build to core business, this platform will be asset managed by Lennar, with third-party equity and debt on the assets in an asset-light program for Lennar. As housing needs and demographics continue to evolve, we believe that the single-family rental sector will continue to outperform. 
In addition, the Upward America Venture continues Lennar's vision of becoming an ESG-driven homebuilding company by making our high-quality homes not only available for sale but also for rent, with the portion of the homes available with a rent-to-own option. The vehicle's social focus provides a unique opportunity for family and individuals across the country to live in brand-new Lennar homes, at an attainable price point, all without putting up a down payment. Given this, we have a distinct opportunity to create upward mobility in the housing market through this initiative. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon."

As Rick and Stuart noted, matching sales pace with our production pace has been our consistent strategic focus that has enabled us to drive excellent performance. By pairing production and sales, we've maximize",860,"Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick and Stuart noted, matching sales pace with our production pace has been our consistent strategic focus that has enabled us to drive excellent performance. By pairing production and sales, we've maximized margins and driven bottom line profitability. 
In the current environment, we could have easily generated more sales, but our view has been and remains that the key to success in this market is all about managing the supply chain and production. I'd like to briefly describe our strategy, performance and expectations for production and construction costs in order to shed some light on how this strategy has been central to our accomplishments this quarter and how it will impact the balance of 2021. 
First, let me share with you some statistics from our first quarter. Our total construction cost per square foot was down 0.7% in Q1 year-over-year, but up 1.9% sequentially from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, lumber costs increased about $1 per square foot or $2,300 per home, both year-over-year and sequentially. These cost increases were more than offset by other cost decreases year-over-year, but not sequentially, resulting in the overall year-over-year cost decline and sequential cost increase. 
Year-over-year, our construction cost, as a percent of average sales price, decreased from 45% to 42% and remained flat sequentially as our pricing power, driven by our controlled sales pace, offset cost increases seen in our first quarter deliveries. 
Let me take a moment to discuss the situation of lumber and other supply chain challenges. As we all know, lumber is the largest component -- largest cost component of new home construction. It is well documented that the cost of lumber is at all-time high, and supply is limited and demand is high. We will see additional cost increases from lumber throughout the year, with increases from today's all-time high lumber pricing starting with Q3 deliveries. 
Given the unprecedented pricing levels we've seen, it's challenging to predict how lumber prices will trend. But we're encouraged by the additional OSB capacity currently coming online, and the lumber future market indicating some relief. The overall production environment today is defined by a supply chain limited to no excess inventory. Normally, the manufacturers that supply our industry carry 30 to 60 days of inventory and are able to adjust distribution to meet varying demand. However, due to COVID-19 disruptions and manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and overseas in 2020, that capacity has, at best, dramatically reduced and at worst, eliminated. At the same time, demand has increased from both new home construction and big box retailers. 
This situation makes the supply chain particularly vulnerable to further disruptions, such as the deep freeze that shut Texas last month. That storm shut down the plants that manufacture MDI and poly-based resins, impacting the manufacturing of OSB, paint, insulation, refrigerators and other products. We're working closely with all of these effective manufacturers to ensure that we have the products we need being delivered to our jobsites as we need them. 
To manage for these disruptions in the supply chain of materials as well as to be the builder of choice in a continually constrained labor market, we employ the following strategies and processes. First, we remain disciplined about our Everything's Included approach, which simplifies the entire building process for our trades. We shared data by providing frequent forecast an open purchase order information. We simplified by rationalizing SKUs across multiple categories. We access alternative supply chain solutions and aggressively prebuy materials as needed. Most importantly, we communicate. 
Our trade partners are well in advance of our upcoming production needs. Our divisions know the extended manufacturing lead times in real time and our national supply chain team, led by Kemp Gillis, together with our retail purchasing VPs, are in constant communication with each other, our divisions and all of our trade partners. 
I would best describe the production environment as challenged, but manageable. In the first quarter, we saw a mild increase in our cycle time as we dealt with resolving issues as they presented themselves. And through our strong supply chain partnerships, we were largely able to overcome supply constraints. Our highest volume partners have given us expanded lead times, which we were able to accommodate due to our production first model, where our needs are forecasted several quarters out. We believe we're well positioned with our disciplined and production first process to continue to manage through new challenges as they present themselves. Our focus on these processes is why we are comfortable affirming our deliveries for the year. 
However, this environment is not easily stressed to allow for an increase in deliveries. So our focus is on maintaining our planned starts, deliveries and maximizing margins. 
In conclusion, Lennar's strategy of a managed approach to production and sales pace produced great results in our first quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we're confident that our gross margins will remain around 25% and will drive our SG&A lower, producing higher net margins and a stronger bottom line, while maintaining our planned volume. 
And now I'll turn it over to Diane."

Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain of our 2021 highlights, and then provide detailed guidance for Q2 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
So we'll start with homebuilding. For new orders, we ended the quarter with new orders of 15,570, a 26% increase year-over-year. While this was the highest new order total for a quarter in our history, we continued to be focused on production first, matching sales and starts. 
In the first quarter, our starts were 15,982, also up 26% year-over-year. From a pace standpoint, our monthly sales pace was 4.5 for the quarter, matching our monthly start pace of 4.6 for the quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,077 homes in backlog, with a dollar value of $9.5 billion and ended with 1,162 active communities. Our cancellation rate was about 10%. 
For the quarter, deliveries totaled 12,314, up 19% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 25%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on attaining price increases, while controlling and matching cost increases. 
In addition, we also had lower interest expense per home as a result of our continued pay downs of senior notes in the past several years and lower field expense per home due to a higher delivery line. Our SG&A was 8.4%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. This improvement is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform. 
Our net margin for the quarter was 16.6%, the highest first quarter net margin ever achieved. Our Financial Services team also executed at high levels, reporting $146 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $100 million compared to $41 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited primarily from an increase in volume and lower cost per loan, combined with an increase in secondary margins. 
Total operating earnings was $31 million compared to $10 million in the prior year. Total earnings increased primarily due to an increase in volume. We also started to realize upside from our strategic technology investments in our Lennar Other segment. As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a $470 million mark-to-market gain on our Opendoor investment as a result of the company going public in December. The gain was based on Opendoor's stock price at the end of our first quarter, which was 2,802. This investment will be mark-to-market at each quarter end based on Opendoor's stock price at that time. 
I also want to mention that we have a new line item on our P&L, titled, Charitable Foundation Contribution, which is the contribution to our Lennar Foundation. Previously, our annual contribution to the foundation was 1% of net income. Beginning with this year, 2021, we will be increasing our contribution to $1,000 per home delivery. 
And so just for a bit of perspective, using fiscal 2020 numbers, our net income last year was about $2.5 billion, which resulted in a contribution of about $25 million. If we had contributed at $1,000 per home level, our contribution would have been about $53 million. So the increase is significant, and we are very pleased and very proud to be able to give back even more to our communities, doing good while we do well. 
And then turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating increased homebuilding cash flow. At quarter end, we owned 189,000 homesites and controlled 154,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned, decreasing to 3.4 years from 4.0 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increasing to 45% from 31% in the prior year. We continue to make progress, as Rick mentioned, in reaching our goal of 3-year supply owned and 50% of homesites controlled by the end of the year. 
During the quarter, we repurchased a small amount of shares, 510,000, for a total of 43 million. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 24%, down from 33.6% in the prior year. 
And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $19 billion from $16 billion in Q1 of the prior year. And our book value per share increased to $60.30 from $51.39 in the prior year. 
And finally, just a few weeks ago, we were upgraded by Fitch to BBB flat from BBB-. This upgrade follows the upgrade to investment-grade from Moody's that we received last November. We are quite pleased with the rating agency advances that we have achieved in recent months. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong. This balance sheet enables us to execute a spinoff. And even after that transaction, we will have a rock-solid balance sheet. 
And with that brief overview, let's turn to guidance. I'll first provide detailed guidance for the second quarter, and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. So we'll start with homebuilding. 
We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 16,500 to 16,700 homes, and our Q2 deliveries will be in the range of 14,200 to 14,400 homes. Our Q2 average sales price should be around $405,000. As we mentioned, we expect to maintain our gross margin at about 25% for Q2, despite rising material and labor costs. We expect our Q2 SG&A to be in the range of 7.9% to 8%, as we continue to focus on benefiting from technology efficiencies. 
And for the combined category of homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other, we expect a Q2 loss in the range of about $5 million to $10 million. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q2 will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. For our multifamily operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. And so the Lennar Other category, we also expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. 
Now remember that this guidance for Lennar Other does not include any potential mark-to-market gains on our Hippo or States Title, Doma investment. We have not yet concluded if we will be able to utilize mark-to-market accounting for these investments. And if we do, the gain will be determined by the stock price of each company at the end of our second quarter. 
Additionally, this guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our current Opendoor investments since this too will be determined by the stock price of Opendoor at the end of our second quarter. And lastly, the guidance does not include a gain related to the sale of our SunStreet Solar company, since the shares that we will receive as consideration will be valued at Sunnova's closing price on the day that the transaction closes. 
We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenue. And as I mentioned, our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered during the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 311 million shares. 
And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share for the quarter. And so now let me provide some guidance for the fiscal year. 
We still expect to deliver between 62,064 homes, but with now higher gross margin guidance of about 25% for the year, and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.6% to 7.8% for the year. And we believe our average sales price for the year will be about $400,000. And our financial services earnings will be in the range of $445 million to $460 million. And finally, our tax rate should be about 24%. 
And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a very strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for another excellent year. 
And so with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions."

So first question on the gross margin guidance, you all bumped it up to 25%. That implies flat sequentially throughout the year when normally we see sequential improvement due to leverage as we move through the year. Could you just let us know what your expectations are for land, labor, material inflation is as we move through the year? And does this imply -- since it's flat gross margin through the year, does this imply that some of your internal efficiencies are starting to level off or pricing you assume is cooling?

It was flat through the year, recognizing that along the way and through the year, some of the construction costs would rise and would pull-through at different parts of the year. 
So this is consistent with how we were thinking at the beginning of the year in terms of the way the year would shape up, even with, as you say, the leverage embedded in increased volume as you go quarter-by-quarter. So what you're seeing is significant improvement that we're reflecting in each quarter's results.

That will go up by about another 4,000 or 5,000 per home as we move into Q2. And then in Q3 and Q4, we'll see a repeat of that pattern as lumber prices moved higher in the recent months before what we hope will be an expected leveling off. 
So all of us have mentioned, we've got significant pricing power that's overcoming that big needle mover of the lumber cost increases, that's just a reflection of where the lumber market is. Not something that any of us can do anything about until the market itself corrects. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing other cost increases, other categories. There is supply constraint and increased demand. So natural supply and demand that's occurring in the supply chain."

I did want to ask you generally, though, about LENx, which I understand is Len to the x power. But I see 2 potential approaches and I'm curious, which is more the priority for you, which is really more the emphasis that is sort of driving your decision-making or will drive your decision-making around LENx. 
One would be to create a separate operating segment of sorts in order to have a collection of businesses be more easily valuable by the street, literally able to be valued more easily. But then another alternative would be that you want to create an ecosystem. An ecosystem of tech-enabled businesses that a customer enters into when they walk into one of your sales centers or one of your rental offices, in order to sort of maximize the value that you can both provide and get compensated for by that customer. And I'm wondering, which was more the priority -- or is more of the priority in your mind? And then as a follow-up, do we consider -- should we consider these initiatives to be cash flow positive or negative meaningfully over the next few years at all?"

Our primary focus in building LENx, and it has been evolutionary, has been the latter approach. It was and continues to be all about -- in the background of our core business, we inject these new streams of activity that are enabling a better customer experience and better cost structure for our company. I've called it and said it's building a better mousetrap. 
And if you think about the companies we've talked about over time, you could imagine that a customer walks in and says, ""I've got a home to sell."" We've got a solution. It's the iBuyer space. And that leads right into a blend powered mortgage application, which is a seamless, simpler technology-enabled mortgage application, feeding right into Doma and the entire closing process being one tap and digitized and an immediate home insurance policy, it becomes a joyful experience with our technology companies operating in the background creating an excellent experience for our customer, but driving our cost structure down and enabling us to build profitability and even pass on some of those savings to our customer, which is a greater good. 
And I haven't really mentioned that each of our technology companies has an ESG component and focus as well, and that will develop over time. So really think about it as we're building a better Lennar by investing in these technology companies and the investment in the technology company. We're not really isolating and looking at as a separate operating business, and I would -- I just want to daylight that Eric Feder and his team of Sana Khan, Christian Falk and a number of others have really developed some expertise in creating a focus on technology companies that matter, together with change management, dovetailed within the company. 
And I think that, over time, what you're going to see as these companies develop their own value proposition, as you've already started to see, they do become cash flow positive in their own right, and each of them has a map to that strategy. And the dovetail with Lennar and the operating performance is what gets us very enthusiastic. So we're more focused on the latter approach than we are on the former. And we really want to deemphasize what I call the shiny object of the big gains, and I want to emphasize more the core programs that Rick is involved in, Jon is involved in, Eric is involved. I'm involved in every single day of building a better company. That's what it's really about."

The second thing I wanted to ask about relates to this land venture, which you talked a little bit about in your 10-K, and you talked a little bit about today. 
Rick, I believe you spoke to the idea that this would be creating a structure, by which you can basically bucket land parcels into various -- categorizing and to put them into buckets with different durations and different returns on capital expectations. In a way, though, that's kind of what you've always been doing, right? I mean like homebuilders always -- what they're doing things properly are sort of evaluating parcels of land for duration and returns on capital expectations and so forth. 
So is what's different here that you've got some form of a system that enables you to do that more quickly by isolating specific metrics or something?

We have always done what we thought we could do to maximize the land opportunities out there, whether they be short term or long term. 
I think the key difference associated with this is we've created something that's very programmatic and systemized and oriented, where we're matching capital and returns to either short-dated and long-dated land opportunities. And what we've learned as we've evolved our thinking over the last several years is that there is tremendous appetite out there in the market for risk-adjusted returns. And the returns associated with the short term sort of current inventory type of opportunity is a much lower threshold than something that is a little bit riskier. 
And by creating a programmatic systemized machine, where we funnel our land opportunities to either one of these programmatic structures, it allows us to become very efficient and to really incredibly scour the land opportunities out there to grow our business. 
So Jon, anything you want to add to that?"

So if you think about the lease risky component, that's the land in which we're building a home zone. And that should really be financed at the lowest cost of capital, primarily our cash on hand or revolver. 
And then if you look at the next bucket and call it the land that is more like with that's ready to come into that production assembly line that's from, say, 0 to 4 years out, that is properly structured relatively very low-risk and should attract the cost of capital that is also very low and separated from sort of that midterm bucket of land, which has historically looked for high teens to 20% kind of returns from an investment standpoint. 
And by properly structuring and really reducing the significant portion of risk associated with that middle bucket we're able to create, as Rick said, a -- more of a systemic approach about a significant size and scale to it, allowing for us a one-stop facility to be able to make it very easy to transact and to really position land to be de-risked."

There's no question that stimulus is a significant part of the equation as we've noted in my remarks. Interest rates are still low by all measures. Yes, they've ticked up a little bit. But the other side of the equation is the savings rate and the stimulus that's out there just in the most recent stimulus bill. Additional legislation seems to be coming down the track, and that will, once again, stimulate even more demand. 
The complicating part is that we're dealing more with supply shortage than we are dealing with a shortage of demand. But the fact is demand is very, very strong. And a tax credit to stimulate more demand, it seems this is probably going to layer on more demand to an already constrained supply, which will probably have the impact of raising prices somewhat, just supply and demand imbalance. 
So the question is what do you do across the country that is talking about workforce housing and short supply, as a governing kind of component, and it seems that there's going to have to be some additional initiative to focus on more land entitlement more streamlined government involvement and constraining the supply, but we'll have to see how it all shakes out. 
As things sit right now, when we look at the housing market, it's one of the reasons that we think that for the next years, the housing market benefits from a fairly strong supply limitation and demand strength -- strong demand and shorter supply. 
And for the homebuilders, we're going to have to be an active participant in finding reconciliation here and participating in building new homes."

One of the things that has us most enthusiastic about this program is the social component. This is an upward mobility program. It produces access across Lennar's landscape to a broader array of social and economic participants in our communities and really stretches and gives single-family lifestyle access to a much broader array of the population. 
Now that's the case for single-family for rent, in general. But notably, in this program, we have a component of our program that is dedicated to and focused on lease with an option to buy. And we're really focused on finding a way to not only create accessibility to our single-family homes in our single-family for rent program, but also to engage more people in the ability over time to find their way to homeownership, which we think is a greater good. So this is an exciting program for the company, and I think, ultimately, for the industry, and we've designed it to be ultimately an industry solution as well."

Stuart, and team, obviously, appreciate all the detail and the results. I wanted to ask 2 quick questions. One, operationally, on the homebuilding side and one, see if there's any way to squeeze out a couple more numbers on the spin. 
On the sales pace side, in particular, you guys have been very consistent in your approach to managing pace and where possible perhaps getting a little bit more on the margin side. And I think that strategy really comes home in an environment today, where rates are rising, which everything else equal, would lower the true, what I'm kind of referring to recently, is theoretical level of demand. Because certainly, as you've said, your sales pace is below that level, you could run a lot hotter if you choose. 
And so in that type of dynamic, you would think that if rates going higher, impair overall market demand, but you're running below that, you should be able to still maintain a pretty steady business and a pretty steady order inflow. So obviously, we're just in the initial stages of this rate rise, but I was wondering if that theory is accurate in that over the last -- throughout the first quarter, particularly February and into March, given again that you could have run a lot hotter, and in other words, below true market demand, that the recent move-in rates really hasn't impacted you at all from the order cadence?"

But in today's market, as I've noted",319,"So look, I think, Mike, the way to think about it is I think that there tends to be a knee-jerk that interest rates move up and the homebuilders are going to have sales turmoil, and that might be conventional wisdom. 
But in today's market, as I've noted, there are offsets to the movement in interest rates. First of all, interest rates have -- are moving from a historically abnormally low rate. We're still lower than we were a year ago. Interest rates are still low. But the offset is the fact that the savings rate in the country has really enabled so many more people to be able to afford a down payment. 
The increase in home prices is, on the one hand, a negative, but on the other hand, a positive in that someone who owns a home, who's going to sell their first-time home has a bigger down payment for their move-up home. 
So there's this kind of trickle-up portion of this. And then stimulus is adding to the availability of capital to support the home and mortgage business. You might find that interest rates knock some people out of the credit boxes that are out there. But there's so much demand. The backfill has been pretty readily supportive of maintaining sales pace. So at the end of the day, we've really seen very little trail off in demand. 
In fact, it's continued to be strong and be building what has been traditionally a spring selling season. It's hard to detect where the spring selling season is because we've been consistently strong all the way through what, at this time, should be the beginning of the spring selling season. 
So I think that what I'd say is that, that we're still seeing a very strong demand pattern. And even with interest rates ticking up, there are offsets to that tick up that are keeping demand strong."

I think one of the key numbers, I guess, was that this tax-free spin would -- could be comprised of $3 billion to $5 billion in assets with no debt. And you mentioned, obviously, the different businesses that would, from which the spin could be comprised of with LMC being the backbone, I was hoping if it's possible, if you kind of take that $3 billion to $5 billion asset range, what would be the corresponding range for liabilities? And also on the income statement side, any type of corresponding management fees or income that you're deriving from today that's running through your income statement as well as on the corporate G&A side? So I don't know if you could give perhaps all those numbers, but even a few would be very helpful."

I think that, as my starting point and just giving you some answer to that, is we start with a really strong balance sheet right now. You see a debt to total cap at 24%, and sizable profitability coming through the year. So you can imagine, our balance sheet continues to get stronger. 
That really enables us to do a spin of a sizable amount of assets with no liabilities associated, meaning no debt. And it leaves us with a balance sheet at Lennar that is just rock solid. So very little impact to the balance sheet. 
Now from an operating and earnings standpoint, you can think similarly. Look, we've been building these businesses in the background, and we've been reporting on them for years. These businesses are up running and have been operating. But because of the composition of some of them, like LMC, where you have depreciation and you have third-party management fees and a variety of things, they don't show GAAP profitability. So there's the -- that's right. 
You're going to see very little, if any, impact to the earnings of the core company. But these operating businesses, as they stand on their own with their own identified metrics, this enables those businesses to be able to run more effectively and efficiently as a stand-alone company. This is not about creating some notion of value or anything else, the stand-alone Homebuilding Financial Services group and the stand-alone asset management business is the right configuration for these businesses on a go-forward basis. And you'll see very little impact to Lennar, the remainco bottom line. And an exciting value proposition and stand-alone enterprise for spinco as it stands on its own. 
That's the structure. That's the skeleton. It's as far as we can go right now, but all of this is driven by the fact that we have a balance sheet that supports. We can give this kind of a strong spin or dividend, as you might think of it, without impacting the underlying balance sheet and building 2 or furthering 2 very strong companies on a go-forward basis. 
And I would just say, Mike, as you think about this, remember, Lennar has done this before. In 1997, we spun LNR. And we did it in a very carefully constructive manner where it was 2 separate businesses that were long-standing, and we identified and ran both companies in a very successful manner, and we expect to be doing some of that similarly all over again. 
Listen, I know that this has been a lot to absorb, and we've run over time, but I thought it was worth the time to do that. We look forward to continuing to update you on all elements of our business, and look forward to a strong 2021. Thank you for joining."

It's been a while since we've done an earnings call together, altogether, but we're all here and happy to be returning to normal. 
So today's call is pretty straightforward, so we'll try to keep our remarks as brief as possible and leave time for your questions. I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick will talk about market strength, community count and our growing single-family for rent strategy. And John will update our just-in-time land strategy, supply chain, production and construction costs. As usual, Diane will give detailed financial information highlights and guidance, and then we'll attempt to answer as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions]
So with that, let me start, and I want to start my remarks today with a big shout-out to the entire Lennar operating team. There is simply no way to report our quarterly results without starting with the engine that produces those results. 
The market conditions have made these the best of times in the housing market. These times have their challenges as well. Performing in these best of times is hard grinding work that requires the coordination of a first-class hands-on and engaged management team working in close partnership with extraordinary associates who care deeply about our customers and our company and leave nothing on the field in achieving those results. 
I'd also like to give a very shout out to 1 person, in particular, and that is our Chief Operating Officer, Fred Rothman. It is noteworthy that Fred is not with us here in the room today. This is because he's probably out in one of our divisions, listening with the management team there. He's connecting the dots between their performance and the performance of the company and the articulated strategies of the company. Key is with the people. 
Recently, we had a Fortune magazine article written about the company. Fred wasn't pictured nor interviewed because he was busy, out with the people that make things happen. In fact, Fred is the every person of Lennar, not pictured, not interviewed, no limelight, no fanfare, just heads down doing the work that makes this company great. Thank you, Fred. You make us proud. 
The associates of Lennar, from homebuilding to financial services to LENx to the outer reaches of our ancillary business segments, perform the impossible on a regular basis. They care for all of our core constituents, our customers, our shareholders, our building partners and our community as well as caring for each other. The harmony and camaraderie at Lennar is in itself a real source of pride, and that drives us all to excellence in our business to innovation to stay at the cutting edge to integrity in everything we do to shared prosperity across our communities with our money and our time in coordination with our Lennar foundation. I know I joined everyone in this room today in saying a big thank you to our associates and telling our shareholders, bondholders, analysts and investors that we, here in this room, are proud to have the privilege to present their results to you today. 
Now as I've already noted, from a macro perspective, the housing market remains very strong as these are the best of times. Demand has continued to strengthen, while the supply of new and existing homes has remained constrained. New home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that has persisted over the past decade. And while some question whether that deficit is 1 million homes or 5.5 million homes, the bottom line is that supply is short. Land, labor and supply chain are all limiting factors in the drive to meet current demand. So supply is short and is likely to remain that way for some time to come. 
Even though home prices have moved much higher and interest rates have moved slightly higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago, and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. Millennials are moving out of their parents' homes and forming families. Apartment dwellers are finding a first-time home, and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling at higher prices, and that equity is enabling first-time move-ups. Yesterday's move-up home is selling at a strong price and with increased equity enabling customers to consider and purchase a larger home. The upward spiral of a strong housing market is in full swing. 
Additionally, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to purchase and sell homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transactions. They are also solving important industry problems that have needed solutions for a very long time. The iBuyers, led by Opendoor, are becoming more than just a home sale option. They are an ever more effective and instrumental convenience provider as the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. Expected closing dates move and the customer -- and customer plans are disrupted. The fragile dance of selling an old home while closing on a new home becomes frustrated by these delays. 
Opendoor and other iBuyer have developed flexibility programs that are designed to bridge that gap and simplify unpredictable delays. The iBuyer value proposition is more compelling than just a ready and convenient homebuyer. It is becoming the core of a coordinated closing without double moves or double housing costs. The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself. 
The single-family for rent participants are making a single-family home lifestyle accessible to more families, to working families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is to build more homes and make a growing portion of that housing stock available to -- for more families to rent if they can't meet the requirements for home ownership. This is simply a social equity program that enables better housing for more families and more diverse families without weakening the mortgage market. Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single-family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own and while commercial and professional owners manage the risk profile. Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families. And the industry is rewiring to make better housing accessible and affordable to more families. Rick will cover this in more detail shortly. 
The housing market is not only very strong, but it is also going through some very interesting structural changes that will promote stability in the market and extend housing benefits to the breadth of a diverse society. The iBuyer space promote liquidity, frictionless transactions and enables mobility, while professionally owned single-family for rent is providing workforce housing with social equity and upward mobility that has never existed before. These changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality of the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is strong while it is evolving in some very constructive ways. 
So in the context, a very strong overall market conditions, Lennar's very strong second quarter results reflect a lot of hard work and a consistent and focused strategic plan. We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We have limited growth at the top line while in favor of an even greater growth at the bottom line. We focused on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end, and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our single-family for rent program. We have focused on cash flow; debt reduction and stock buyback; land owned versus controlled; return on capital and return on equity; and of course, on innovative technologies. And we've carefully managed an already stressed supply chain by maintaining our delivery targets for the year rather than increasing them while we focus on delivering high-quality homes to our customers. All of this strategic focus shows through in our second quarter results and will carry through the -- throughout the year and into 2022. 
In the second quarter, we grew our deliveries 14% year-over-year and grew revenues 22%, which drove a net after-tax income increase of 61% and an after-tax pre-extraordinary item increase of 79%. Our bottom line increase is driven by our second quarter gross margin of 26.1% versus 21.6% last year. And as noted in our press release, we expect our deliveries for the year to be consistent with prior guidance given the stressed supply chain, while our gross margin continues to grow consistently throughout the year. 
At the same time, we've remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a second quarter all-time low at 7.6% versus 8.3% last year and driving our net margin to 18.5% this year versus 13.3% last year. 
Alongside our homebuilding operations, our financial services group has continued to exceed all expectations with $121 million of earnings contribution, in part due to excellent secondary market execution. The consistent performance beat from this group, however, continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure even while costs are going up generally. 
Together with our asset-light focus, strong gross and net margins and financial services execution, we are driving significantly higher cash flow, which is driving balance sheet improvement as well. In our second quarter, we achieved our 50% owned versus controlled land ratio goal 2 quarters earlier than expected, and we reduced our land supply to 3.3 years from 3.9 years last year. All of these events drove our balance sheet to a 23.1% debt-to-total capital ratio with almost $2.6 billion of cash and 0 borrowed on our bank line. 
Let me briefly focus attention on return on equity, return on capital and our inventory turn. I've noted to many of you that we remain very focused on cash flow, returns and inventory returns, and we have. Our return on equity stands now at 18.8%, which is 550 basis point -- a 550 basis point improvement over last year. Our return on capital is now 15% and a 500 basis point improvement. And our inventory turn, which is just starting to move, now stands at 1x turn, which is up from 0.9 last year. 
While Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments, it's important to note that these components are squarely in our focus. They continue to make a compelling case for multiple expansion, and they are at the top of our mind as we consider, configure and size our proposed spin-off. These dramatic points of improvement, which we expect to continue through the year, have enabled us to reconsider the size of our spin-off and actually aim for a larger asset base in order to further fortify this fun business. Accordingly, we are now targeting an asset base of $5 billion to $6 billion, which is -- which will lead the remaining Lennar pure-play homebuilding and financial services company with an appropriately liquid balance sheet and no material loss of reported earnings. We continue to believe that the best way to enhance Lennar's business model is as a stand-alone pure-play, asset-light high inventory turn, homebuilder manufacturer and financial services company. 
Aside from size, we have very little to update on the spin this quarter. As noted last quarter, the new company will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business vertical. Two of these verticals have raised third-party capital -- have already raised third-party capital and are active asset managers. That's LMC, our multifamily platform, and LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform. Both of these platforms are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations. 
Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business, and we have a growing technology investment business, which is part of LENx. As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. And while I'm certain that you all would like a lot more detail, you can expect to hear a lot more about the spin in our next quarter's earnings release. 
So let me wrap up by saying that we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit. The market condition remains extremely strong for the foreseeable future. As I've noted, we expect a very strong second half of 2021. While we are not projecting more deliveries, given the very tight land, labor and materials market, we are projecting growing gross margin and a very healthy bottom line. 
As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market. Simply put, supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move. It feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early, and building through those sales is slower than expected. We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up for the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

Key to that ha",1308,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong, our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead because you lose your ability to offset potential pricing cost increases with sales price increases. 
In addition, in this appreciating market with slightly longer cycle times, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to allow for further cost protection and sales price appreciation. Our first quarter results prove out the success of the strategy, as we achieved gross margin increases of 450 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. During the second quarter, we started 5.5 homes per community, which was a 90% increase from last year and a 20% increase sequentially. This production and margin-driven, sales-focused program will drive further margin improvement and increase deliveries in the back half of the year, given our ramp up in starts in the second quarter. 
In the second quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories from entry-level to move-up and in our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 8.6% in the quarter, down 1,020 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially. This is additional evidence that our buyers have the required down payment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home. 
As we look across the country, we're seeing strength in all of our markets. Here's some color on some of our stronger markets. Starting in Florida. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to go to contract. The hottest markets in Florida are Naples in Sarasota in the Southwest; Miami, Broward and Dayton in the Southeast in Tampa. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions. 
In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets, benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We are the top builder in each of these markets. 
Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business, employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and a tremendous job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector. The strongest market in the United States today is Austin. 
Notwithstanding out migration from parts of California, the markets in California are strong. Driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply, making housing the #1 agenda item for the Governor. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing a migration from the coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability, compounded with the opportunity to buy a larger home for the money. This extra boost in demand, combined with limited inventory in great schools, is fueling demand in these areas. 
Phoenix and Las Vegas are strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. Las Vegas is benefiting from the full reopening of the casinos and increased tourism, and Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability. 
The Pacific Northwest continues to be strong. The market has a natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries that limit production. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but they're strength and depth of market across the company -- country. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth in community count. Even as we continue to close out communities at a much faster pace than expected given the strength in the market, our community count at the end of the second quarter grew to 1,225 communities, up 63 communities or 5.4% from the end of the first quarter. We are also still on track to end fiscal 2021 with approximately 10% more communities on a year-over-year basis. This should position us for consistent continued growth in fiscal 2022. 
Finally, I'd like to give you some additional details on LSFR, Lennar's single-family rental platform. As we discussed last quarter, Lennar formed LSFR to facilitate a better time delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times and to make the single-family lifestyle accessible to more families. At the end of the first quarter, LSFR formed the Upward America Venture, which was capitalized with $1.25 billion of equity from blue-chip institutional investors. Just after the end of the second quarter, LSFR closed a $750 million credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which, combined with the equity commitments, positions the Upward America Venture with extremely cost-effective capital to acquire over $4 billion of purpose-built communities and scattered site homes from Lennar. We expect Lennar's peak capital investment in the venture to be $50 million over the duration of the vehicle. 
Since the beginning, the Upwad America Venture has purchased 216 homes for approximately $48 million. These homes were located in 18 communities in 7 markets across 3 of Lennar's operating regions. 188 of these homes were purchased in purpose-built communities and 28 were scattered homes purchased on a just-in-time basis from available inventory in Lennar's existing for-sale communities. All of these homes fit a predetermined buy box approved by the venture's equity investors. To facilitate the purchase of these homes, LSFR worked hand-in-hand with LENx to develop proprietary technology that produces automated underwriting and pricing that harnesses Lennar's data management and business intelligence systems along with third-party data to evaluate which of Lennar's homes fit within the venture's buy box. 
At the end of the second quarter, the Upward America Venture had a pipeline of 2,534 homes under contract located in 29 communities across 11 markets with a total purchase price of $596 million. 2,500 of these homes are in purpose-built communities and 34 homes are scattered homes in Lennar's existing for-sale communities. 
As Stuart mentioned in his opening comments, the social aspect of providing affordable housing and making the single-family lifestyle available to more families is a critical aspect to the Upward America Venture. This is proving to be just the case as the average lease rent in the portfolio to date is $1,729, meaning that a household making $59,280 a year or more can afford to live in a brand-new home without a down payment. 
To put some perspective on this, the average teacher salary in 2019 and 2020 in the U.S. was $63,465. This lines up squarely with our goal of providing brand-new, high-quality homes at affordable prices. This is workforce housing with a single-family lifestyle. 
To expand on the potential to provide real home ownership to a broader base of families, we have focused on developing a rent-to-own program for scattered home purchases within the Upward America Venture. We are in the final stages of developing this program with [ Divi ], a Lennox portfolio company. [ Divi ] is a market leader in upward mobility for renters across the country. We expect this program to be up and running in the third quarter. We are very excited with the progress we've made so far with LSFR, the demand for single-family rental homes remain strong, lease up times are compressing, and we have seen real rent growth. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to John."
30763,717301504,2322642,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 17, 2021",2021-06-17,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick.

Today, I'm going to walk you through 2 topics: how we execute on our asset-light land strategy for a just-in-time delivery system of home sites and how we are managing the current unprecedented challenges of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. As Stuart noted, Lennar has made significant strides in strengthening our balance sheet with improved cash flow generation, driven primarily by the reduction in land owned versus optioned in the years of land owned, which respectively stand at 50% option and 3.3 years. 
In the second quarter, we added about 38,000 home sites net to our controlled total and purchased about 21,500 home sites. We began our asset-light focus years ago, starting with several large regional land relationships who own and develop land on Lennar's behalf. We then created a strategic national process around our approach. The first critical step in formulating this approach was to separate land into 3 distinct risk categories. 
The first category is finished land that is ready for the construction of homes to be started. The second is land under development being readied for the first category is typically less than 4 to 5 years from being ready for construction starts. Land in the third category is beyond the 4- to 5-year period that may need some entitlement, significant planning and has not yet started development. After separating land into these 3 buckets, we then match the risk profile of each asset with the right source of risk-adjusted capital and expertise. 
The first category of land is carried on our balance sheet as it is the land under the homes we are building. This land has no risk to it, and our cash on hand or revolver are the lowest cost of capital for it. The second and third categories of land are structured as option agreements with various strategic relationships that have the strength in capital that fit the specific land profile. Assets that are low in risk profile may go into land banks, which have the next lowest cost of capital. Other more complex land is a good fit for our large regional relationships. 
More recently, we have added significantly larger national relationships structured to match the type and asset and also contractually structured option agreements, which will survive potential market shocks that has historically created risk to defaulting on option deposits and to maintaining control of the option land, thus further reducing risk. 
The distinct land business is compromised -- sorry, this distinct land business is compromised of an operational team with a singular focus on executing our asset-light strategy by closely coordinating with our local division teams and our strategic third-party relationships. This independent team works to ensure a consistent application of processes and procedures to execute on all of the moving pieces from land underwriting to acquisition, development and completion of just-in-time home sites. Importantly, the independence of this team takes the burden off of our homebuilding divisions of negotiating unique individual option agreements with third parties, thereby allowing our divisions to be laser-focused on running our core homebuilding operations. It also provides all of our third-party relationships the ability to work with one voice from a large geographically diverse company. Our focus on separating our land purchases into these 3 distinct risk buckets has allowed us to secure the most cost-effective capital for each land asset. As a result, we are lowering Lennar's cost and risk associated with purchasing each category of land. 
Now I'd like to discuss how Lennar is managing the current environment of supply chain disruptions. You are all familiar with what is occurring. The supply chain has been impacted by the pandemic, by the storms in Texas and by the surge in demand from new construction and big box retailers. Many manufacturers are finding themselves without the materials and/or capacity to keep up with their orders. Additionally, there's a nationwide shortage of trucks and drivers that add to the disruption. As you would expect at Lennar, we have brought an intense daily focus on managing this situation. We are effectively managing it through leveraging our strategic supply chain relationships as well as having an unprecedented internal connectivity between our division, regional and national purchasing teams. Today, we work very closely with the leadership of our strategic supply partners as a result of having been focused on being their builder of choice over the 5 -- over the past 5 years. We have deeply -- we have been deeply involved and over time in developing relationships, processes and procedures to improve their businesses. This is not just lip service as over the past 5 years, Lennar's changed the way we run our business to improve the bottom lines of our strategic partners businesses. Our actions have earned us the right to sit down with our strategic suppliers and find solutions to today's challenges. Sometimes, it's expediting orders and even warehousing early deliveries. In some cases, it's substituting products. But in all situations, we, together with our partners, are finding solutions. The net effect of these disruptions is about a 2-week increase to our cycle times. 
With respect to our local trade partners, the shortage of labor persists now more than ever. Like the supply chain situation, we have brought an intense daily focus to manage this. Again, our Builder of Choice focus for the past 5-plus years is paying dividends. We've also changed the way we do business with our local building trades over this period of time. Significantly, we have refined the forecasting and communication of starts and have implemented Lennar's level-scheduling program for greater visibility of the upcoming workloads for our trade partners. Today, we now have real-time dashboards showing exactly how many tasks each trade has in the coming weeks and months. This enables them to accurately plan for their labor needs and keep our job sites productive. We believe these dashboards to be a best-in-class forecasting and communication solution. 
Also significant for both our suppliers and our local trade partners is our adherence to Lennar's Everything's Included program. This has never been more important. It simplifies the number of SKUs or suppliers and local trades need to carry. In addition, in this current environment, we've taken further steps to reduce the number of SKUs we use in certain constrained categories. 
Other areas of focus for us are using our level-scheduling dashboards to support our ongoing even flow commitment to our trade partners, along with maintaining our production-first focus on matching sales to starts, as Rick discussed. 
Turning to the cost impacts from the combination of supply chain disruptions. The spike in lumber and trade shortages, our construction costs in the second quarter were up 3.9% sequentially and 4.5% year-over-year. However, even as construction costs increased, they decreased as a percent of revenues from 41.8% and 44.5% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively, down to 41.3% in our second quarter. With respect to lumber specifically, we all know that lumber reached an all-time high before very recently coming off of that. 
Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted, and Diane will cover in more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this, and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our -- on lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we will see a more significant benefit for our August starts. 
Lastly, I want to thank the associates of our national land team led by Casey Davis and Jim [ Bavisa ], with close coordination with all of our division land teams effectively executed our land-light strategy and just-in-time home site delivery strategy. I also want to thank our national, regional and division purchasing associates led by [ Camp Gillas ], who have the difficult job of battling through these unprecedented supply chain disruptions, has done so with tremendous focus, effort and poise. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane."

Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain Q2 2021 highlights and then providing detailed guidance for Q3 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
So starting with homebuilding. For the quarter, new orders totaled 17,157 homes, a 32% increase year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 24,741 homes in backlog with a dollar value of $11 billion and 1,225 active communities. Our cancellation rate was 8.6%. For the quarter, deliveries totaled 14,493 homes, up 14% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 26.1%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on maximizing sales price, while controlling cost increases, as Jon described. Additionally, our margins benefited by a 20 basis point decrease in interest expense as compared to the prior year as a result of our consistent focus on debt reduction. 
Our SG&A was 7.6%, an improvement of 70 basis points from the prior year. This decrease is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform. So for the quarter, we generated a net margin of 18.5%, the highest quarter net margin of a repeat. 
Our financial services team also executed at high levels, reporting $121 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $92 million compared to $81 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited from an increase in secondary margins. Title operations -- Title operating earnings were $24 million compared to $76 million in the prior year. The prior year included a gain of $61 million on the deconsolidation of states title now called Doma. Excluding this gain, title earnings increased due to growth in both volume and the margins as technology initiatives improved agency productivity. 
And then turning to our Lennar Other segment. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our residential solar platform to Sunnova Energy International in exchange for shares in that company. At the time of the closing, we recorded a gain of $151 million. We are required to mark-to-market our investment in Sunnova as well as our investment in Opendoor, which went public in our first quarter, at each quarter end based on their stock prices at that time. Accordingly, we recorded mark-to-market losses in the second quarter of approximately [ $276 ] million. 
And now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset-lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating significant homebuilding cash flow. 
At quarter end, we owned 189,000 homesites and controlled 192,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increasing to 50% from 32% in the prior year, thus achieving our controlled percentage goal midyear instead of end of year. All of this progress resulted in achieving a 20% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing all of our returns. During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares totaling $98 million. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt-to-total capital was 23.1%, down from 31.2% in the prior year. After quarter end, in fact, just this week, we retired early at par our $300 million 6.25 senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our senior note balance and saving about $9 million in interest. Our next maturity, $600 million due in January 2022 as a 3-month par call, which we will utilize to prepay those notes in October of this year. After that payment, we will have no senior note maturities until October 2022. 
And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $20 billion from $17 billion in Q2 of the prior year, and our book value per share increased to 62 68 from 52 98 in the prior year. 
And finally, last week, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We are really pleased with the rating agency upgrades we have achieved in recent months and are now investment grade in all 3 -- with all 3 agencies. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong, and we will, of course, continue to remain focused on generating high returns for our shareholders. 
So with that brief overview, now let's turn to guidance. I'll first provide detailed guidance for the third quarter and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 16,300 homes and our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 15,800 to 16,100 homes. Our Q3 average sales price should be between $420,000 and $425,000. We expect our gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for Q3, and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q3 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. 
And then looking at our Other business segments. For Financial Services, we believe our Financial Services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. And for our multifamily operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. 
And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Now note that this guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments on our current or future publicly traded technology investments. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues. And our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 310 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32 per share for the quarter. 
And now let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year. We believe our average sales price for the year will be about $420,000, and we still expect our community count to increase approximately 10% year-over-year by year-end. Our Financial Services earnings will be in the range of $460,000 to $470 million. And finally, our tax rate should be about 23.5%. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategy, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for an excellent year. 
And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Stuart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you view that sales have been slowing more due to, in effect, production constraints and managing the sales pace. I was hoping for any sense of how you view demand as it progressed throughout the quarter? And what makes you comfortable around the idea that overall, the demand backdrop remains not only robust, but it appears still well in excess of available supply."

So when you go from extremely, extremely hot to extremely hot, that's a step down that is really quite acceptable. It's actually a little bit better. And of course, as pricing goes up, people -- fewer people can afford. 
So I would just say, Mike, that while the market might have a mild cooling, it is just from such a high level that demand is still well in excess of supply. And we see this on the ground at our Welcome Home centers on a regular basis. And this is not in any specific market, it really is across the country. 
So when we look at the temperament, the tempo of sales in our Welcome Home centers, the traffic that's coming in, the discussions that we're having, we're still seeing very strong demand. We still see very limited supply, and we recognize that the country and the production of housing has been in deficit for the better part of a decade. And we can argue whether the deficit is one size or another. I think that there are a lot of competing views on that. But still, based on what we see in the market and the logic that we're applying to what we've seen over the past years and the appetite of the buying public, the millennials that still haven't come out of their parents' homes, we think there's a very, very strong demand profile that is out there for an extended period of time."

Secondly, I think perhaps the other key area of debate out there right now is around the sustainability of gross margins. And with the success that you've highlighted this year in terms of managing sales pace and opportunistically improving margin, and obviously, a part of that is to cover cost inflation, but you've been able to do well in excess of that. It's interesting right now that the gross margins you're projecting for '21 are in excess of the prior peak margins in 2005. Interestingly, you're on track to have revenue -- homebuilding revenue more than double 2005. And so you'd think that there are scale benefits certainly associated with that. But I was wondering if you could give any perhaps thoughts on how you think about gross margins going forward over the next couple of years? Obviously, I'm not asking for guidance for '22. But just more broadly, when you think about the gross margin levels that you're generating for this year, what might be the puts and takes outside of sales incentives, which are hard to predict, how you see gross margins, let's say, this cycle and perhaps over the next couple of years versus the last cycle?"

I mean, if you look at the composition of our margin, it is a combination of a lot more efficiency in the way that we're managing our company, the technologies that we're engaging in and incorporating into the way that we're running our business; the efficiency of our land program, just-in-time delivery of land; and frankly, the emergent inventory management component of our single-family for rent component, there are tremendous efficiencies that we are embedding in the core operation of our business. And we think that these are becoming more and more important. 
The way that we're managing our supply chain is a matter of absolute efficiencies being brought into the way that we're operating our business. And you're going to see that we, as a company and hopefully as an industry, are recasting the cost structure all the way from hard cost, labor, materials to the softer costs around SG&A. We are rewiring the way that this business operates to the benefit of a lower cost structure and an opportunity to maintain good margins and still bring affordability to the housing market. And I think that, that's been an extreme part of our program. 
I do want to highlight that additionally, win at our backs is our reduced debt level. As we bring debt down, we have less capital cost, and that's continuing to help our margin picture. And we expect to continue to bring that debt level down. 
So all of the components, from technology, the way we run our business, debt levels, the way that we're just in -- we're becoming more of a just-in-time program, I think is a protective coating around margins for the future, and we're pretty optimistic about where we're going."

But my questions are going to focus on the core homebuilding business. In this environment where you're deliberately, in some cases, holding back sales to age your work in process inventory, it seems like the best indication of future sales isn't actually the number of homes you're selling today, but how many homes you're building. And given that, I noticed that your starts in 2Q were up about 28% from 1Q. The nation's starts were only up 7% sequentially, not seasonally adjusted. So clearly, you're gaining a lot of share. You've started -- I think the actual number was like over 20,000 units in the quarter. And I would think your production capability should increase from here because your community count is increasing. So my question is basically, is it reasonable to think that before too long, your closings should be able to exceed 20,000 units in a quarter?"

Very sensible strategy, I would say. The second question relates to home prices. I think the most striking development across the market has been this massive surge in home prices, not just that you're experiencing, but across the market. According to some measures, resale pricing is up 25% year-over-year. 
When people hear this, and they instinctively think it's a setup for home prices to fall in the future, which, by the way, would set off a pretty bad chain of events if it happened, our own view is that the price jump is a correction rather than an overshoot. It's the result of years of undersupply and pent-up demand and not just low interest rates. And so it makes it very different from like '05, like when demand was very speculative and supply wasn't constrained. But I think people would really like to hear from you how you see the longer-term outlook for pricing. Are we seeing a blow off peak like what happened recently to lumber futures or something? Or have we found a new level of home price that can be resilient in the face of potentially higher rates?"

I think I wouldn't have thought of it as a correction, but the way that you've said it, I think that, that makes sense. I think that home prices are and have reached a point and are continuing to grow, by the way. This is not -- this hasn't slowed. But the home prices have clear -- are reaching a point where it is kind of a correction to a higher price level. I think it's stagnated for a very long period of time as we went through the underproduction years and maybe the mortgage market kind of disabled the production and the demand for homes or certainly early after the downturn. But you have this really interesting time where, not only has the mortgage market normalized, and I think normalized in a very credible way, very protective of that mortgage market, but you also have this really interesting demand coming from single-family for rent. And there's some questions around single-family for rent in interesting ways, but single-family for rent is enabling a single-family lifestyle to a broader range of people who cannot necessarily acquire the down payment or meet the metrics that are needed to qualify for a mortgage, but certainly have the ability to afford the rent on a single-family lifestyle. 
And this notion that the way that people live, the housing that is available to a broader range of people is -- its very predictive of outcomes for families is a really important component that's emergent. And the enablement of the single-family for rent business is just enabling homes available to a broader range, a bigger part of the population, and I think this is a greater good. And we believe, and I think Rick daylighted it and highlighted it very well, we believe that when we're providing more workforce housing, we're expanding the amount of demand that's out there. And yes, we're driving costs up or the price of housing up a little bit. That is driving the cost of housing up because there's more demand and less supply. But at the same time, it's asking the industry to provide more and provide more accessibility to more people. I think that's a generally great impact for the industry."

We've seen, I think, at the beginning stages of the pullback in lumber costs a pullback in demand from the big box retailers as the do-it-yourself market postponed projects for 2 reasons. One is for post-pandemic, they're spending money in their time elsewhere and they didn't want to pay that high cost. So there's been a pullback on demand on the lumber supply chain, which has started to bring costs down from those unsustainable levels. 
So as we think about it, every 10% reduction in random lengths equates to about -- plus [ about ] $1,700 of our average size home. And for OSB, about the same, about another $1,700 per home. So as you see it drop from the level of higher $1,500, we'd expect probably our August starts to see a benefit of $200,000 to $300,000 board feet in random lengths. OSB less than that does not start coming down yet, but it should follow suit."

And our dynamic pricing model is all about measuring where the market is and going to the pricing at where the market is currently. So the answer is, as prices might fluctuate, as price increases perhaps moderate or plateau, our dynamic pricing model is very much focused on getting us to the exact pricing to reach our deliveries commensurate with where our production has been.

It's been a while since we've done an earnings call together, altogether, but we're all here and happy to be returning to normal.  
So today's call is pretty straightforward, so we'll try to keep our remarks as brief as possible and leave time for your questions. I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick will talk about market strength, community count and our growing single-family for rent strategy. And John will update our just-in-time land strategy, supply chain, production and construction costs. As usual, Diane will give detailed financial information, highlights and guidance, and then we'll attempt to answer as many questions as possible. [Operator Instructions] 
So with that, let me start, and I want to start my remarks today with a big shout-out to the entire Lennar operating team. There is simply no way to report our quarterly results without starting with the engine that produces those results.  
The market conditions have made these the best of times in the housing market. These times have their challenges as well. Performing in these best of times is hard grinding work that requires the coordination of a first-class, hands-on and engaged management team working in close partnership with extraordinary associates who care deeply about our customers and our company and leave nothing on the field in achieving those results.  
I'd also like to give a very [ special ] shout-out to one person, in particular, and that is our Chief Operating Officer, Fred Rothman. It is noteworthy that Fred is not with us here in the room today. This is because he's probably out in one of our divisions, listening with the management team there. He's connecting the dots between their performance and the performance of the company and the articulated strategies of the company. He is with the people.  
Recently, we had a Fortune Magazine article written about the company. Fred wasn't pictured nor interviewed because he was busy, out with the people that make things happen. In fact, Fred is the every person of Lennar, not pictured, not interviewed, no limelight, no fanfare, just heads down doing the work that makes this company great. Thank you, Fred. You make us proud.  
The associates of Lennar, from homebuilding to financial services to LENx to the outer reaches of our ancillary business segments, perform the impossible on a regular basis. They care for all of our core constituents, our customers, our shareholders, our building partners and our community as well as caring for each other. The harmony and camaraderie at Lennar is in itself a real source of pride, and that drives us all to excellence in our business, to innovation to stay at the cutting edge, to integrity in everything we do, to shared prosperity across our communities with our money and our time in coordination with our Lennar Foundation. I know I join everyone in this room today in saying a big thank you to our associates and telling our shareholders, bondholders, analysts and investors that we, here in this room, are proud to have the privilege to present their results to you today.  
Now as I've already noted, from a macro perspective, the housing market remains very strong as these are the best of times. Demand has continued to strengthen, while the supply of new and existing homes has remained constrained. New home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that has persisted over the past decade. And while some question whether that deficit is 1 million homes or 5.5 million homes, the bottom line is that supply is short. Land, labor and supply chain are all limiting factors in the drive to meet current demand. So supply is short and is likely to remain that way for some time to come.  
Even though home prices have moved much higher and interest rates have moved slightly higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago, and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. Millennials are moving out of their parents' homes and forming families. Apartment dwellers are finding a first-time home, and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling at higher prices, and that equity is enabling first-time move-ups. Yesterday's move-up home is selling at a strong price and with increased equity enabling customers to consider and purchase a larger home. The upward spiral of a strong housing market is in full swing.  
Additionally, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to purchase and sell homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transactions. They are also solving important industry problems that have needed solutions for a very long time. The iBuyers, led by Opendoor, are becoming more than just a home sale option. They are an ever more effective and instrumental convenience provider as the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. Expected closing dates move and the customer -- and customer plans are disrupted. The fragile dance of selling an old home while closing on a new home becomes frustrated by these delays.  
Opendoor and other iBuyers have developed flexibility programs that are designed to bridge that gap and simplify unpredictable delays. The iBuyer value proposition is more compelling than just a ready and convenient homebuyer. It is becoming the core of a coordinated closing without double moves or double housing costs. The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself.  
The single-family for rent participants are making a single-family home lifestyle accessible to more families, to working families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is to build more homes and make a growing portion of that housing stock available to -- for more families to rent if they can't meet the requirements for home ownership. This is simply a social equity program that enables better housing for more families and more diverse families without weakening the mortgage market. Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single-family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own and while commercial and professional owners manage the risk profile. Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families. And the industry is rewiring to make better housing accessible and affordable to more families. Rick will cover this in more detail shortly.  
The housing market is not only very strong, but it is also going through some very interesting structural changes that will promote stability in the market and extend housing benefits to the breadth of a diverse society. The iBuyer space promote liquidity, frictionless transactions and enables mobility, while professionally owned single-family for rent is providing workforce housing with social equity and upward mobility that has never existed before. These changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality of the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is strong while it is evolving in some very constructive ways.  
So in the context of very strong overall market conditions, Lennar's very strong second quarter results reflect a lot of hard work and a consistent and focused strategic plan. We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We have limited growth at the top line while in favor of an even greater growth at the bottom line. We focused on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end, and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our single-family for rent program. 
We have focused on cash flow; debt reduction and stock buyback; land owned versus controlled; return on capital and return on equity; and of course, on innovative technologies. And we've carefully managed an already stressed supply chain by maintaining our delivery targets for the year rather than increasing them while we focus on delivering high-quality homes to our customers. All of this strategic focus shows through in our second quarter results and will carry through the -- throughout the year and into 2022.  
In the second quarter, we grew our deliveries 14% year-over-year and grew revenues 22%, which drove a net after-tax income increase of 61% and an after-tax pre-extraordinary item increase of 79%. Our bottom line increase is driven by our second quarter gross margin of 26.1% versus 21.6% last year. And as noted in our press release, we expect our deliveries for the year to be consistent with prior guidance given the stressed supply chain, while our gross margin continues to grow consistently throughout the year.  
At the same time, we've remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a second quarter all-time low at 7.6% versus 8.3% last year and driving our net margin to 18.5% this year versus 13.3% last year.  
Alongside our homebuilding operations, our financial services group has continued to exceed all expectations with $121 million of earnings contribution, in part due to excellent secondary market execution. The consistent performance beat from this group, however, continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure even while costs are going up generally.  
Together with our asset-light focus, strong gross and net margins and financial services execution, we are driving significantly higher cash flow, which is driving balance sheet improvement as well. In our second quarter, we achieved our 50% owned versus controlled land ratio goal 2 quarters earlier than expected, and we reduced our land supply to 3.3 years from 3.9 years last year. All of these events drove our balance sheet to a 23.1% debt-to-total capital ratio with almost $2.6 billion of cash and 0 borrowed on our bank line.  
Let me briefly focus attention on return on equity, return on capital and our inventory turn. I've noted to many of you that we remain very focused on cash flow, returns and inventory returns, and we have. Our return on equity stands now at 18.8%, which is 550 basis point -- a 550 basis point improvement over last year. Our return on capital is now 15% and a 500 basis point improvement. And our inventory turn, which is just starting to move, now stands at 1x turn, which is up from 0.9 last year.  
While Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments, it's important to note that these components are squarely in our focus. They continue to make a compelling case for multiple expansion, and they are at the top of our mind as we consider, configure and size our proposed spin-off. These dramatic points of improvement, which we expect to continue through the year, have enabled us to reconsider the size of our spin-off and actually aim for a larger asset base in order to further fortify the spun business. Accordingly, we are now targeting an asset base of $5 billion to $6 billion, which is -- which will leave the remaining Lennar pure-play homebuilding and financial services company with an appropriately liquid balance sheet and no material loss of reported earnings. We continue to believe that the best way to enhance Lennar's business model is as a stand-alone, pure-play, asset-light high-inventory turn, homebuilder, manufacturer and financial services company.  
Aside from size, we have very little to update on the spin this quarter. As noted last quarter, the new company will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business verticals. Two of these verticals have raised third-party capital -- have already raised third-party capital and are active asset managers. That's LMC, our multifamily platform, and LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform. Both of these platforms are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations.  
Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business, and we have a growing technology investment business, which is part of LENx. As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. And while I'm certain that you all would like a lot more detail, you can expect to hear a lot more about the spin in our next quarter's earnings release.  
So let me wrap up by saying that we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit. The market condition remains extremely strong for the foreseeable future. As I've noted, we expect a very strong second half of 2021. While we are not projecting more deliveries, given the very tight land, labor and materials market, we are projecting growing gross margin and a very healthy bottom line.  
As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market. Simply put, supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move. It feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early, and building through those sales is slower than expected. We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up for the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come.  
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

Key to that ha",1305,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong, our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead because you lose your ability to offset potential pricing cost increases with sales price increases.  
In addition, in this appreciating market with slightly longer cycle times, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to allow for further cost protection and sales price appreciation. Our first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy, as we achieved gross margin increases of 450 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. During the second quarter, we started 5.5 homes per community, which was a 90% increase from last year and a 20% increase sequentially. This production and margin-driven, sales-focused program will drive further margin improvement and increase deliveries in the back half of the year, given our ramp-up in starts in the second quarter.  
In the second quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories from entry-level to move-up and in our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 8.6% in the quarter, down 1,020 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially. This is additional evidence that our buyers have the required down payment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home.  
As we look across the country, we're seeing strength in all of our markets. Here's some color on some of our stronger markets. Starting in Florida. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in-migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to go to contract. The hottest markets in Florida are Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest; Miami, Broward and Dayton in the Southeast in Tampa. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions.  
In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets, benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We are the top builder in each of these markets.  
Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business, employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and a tremendous growth in job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector. The strongest market in the United States today is Austin.  
Notwithstanding out-migration from parts of California, the markets in California are strong. Driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply, making housing the #1 agenda item for the Governor. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing a migration from the coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability, compounded with the opportunity to buy a larger home for their money. This extra boost in demand, combined with limited inventory and great schools, is fueling demand in these areas.  
Phoenix and Las Vegas are strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. Las Vegas is benefiting from the full reopening of the casinos and increased tourism, and Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability.  
The Pacific Northwest continues to be strong. The market has natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries that limit production. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but they're strength and depth of market across the company -- country.  
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth in community count. Even as we continue to close out communities at a much faster pace than expected given the strength in the market, our community count at the end of the second quarter grew to 1,225 communities, up 63 communities or 5.4% from the end of the first quarter. We are also still on track to end fiscal 2021 with approximately 10% more communities on a year-over-year basis. This should position us for consistent continued growth in fiscal 2022.  
Finally, I'd like to give you some additional details on LSFR, Lennar's single-family rental platform. As we discussed last quarter, Lennar formed LSFR to facilitate a better timed delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times and to make the single-family lifestyle accessible to more families. At the end of the first quarter, LSFR formed the Upward America Venture, which was capitalized with $1.25 billion of equity from blue-chip institutional investors. Just after the end of the second quarter, LSFR closed a $750 million credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which, combined with the equity commitments, positions the Upward America Venture with extremely cost-effective capital to acquire over $4 billion of purpose-built communities and scattered site homes from Lennar. We expect Lennar's peak capital investment in the venture to be $50 million over the duration of the vehicle.  
Since the beginning, the Upward America Venture has purchased 216 homes for approximately $48 million. These homes were located in 18 communities in 7 markets across 3 of Lennar's operating regions. 188 of these homes were purchased in purpose-built communities and 28 were scattered homes purchased on a just-in-time basis from available inventory in Lennar's existing for-sale communities. All of these homes fit a predetermined buy box approved by the venture's equity investors. To facilitate the purchase of these homes, LSFR worked hand-in-hand with LENx to develop proprietary technology that produces automated underwriting and pricing that harnesses Lennar's data management and business intelligence systems along with third-party data to evaluate which of Lennar's homes fit within the venture's buy box.  
At the end of the second quarter, the Upward America Venture had a pipeline of 2,534 homes under contract located in 29 communities across 11 markets with a total purchase price of $596 million. 2,500 of these homes are in purpose-built communities and 34 homes are scattered homes in Lennar's existing for-sale communities.  
As Stuart mentioned in his opening comments, the social aspect of providing affordable housing and making the single-family lifestyle available to more families is a critical aspect to the Upward America Venture. This is proving to be just the case as the average lease rent in the portfolio to date is $1,729, meaning that a household making $59,280 a year or more can afford to live in a brand-new home without a down payment.  
To put some perspective on this, the average teacher salary in 2019 and 2020 in the U.S. was $63,465. This lines up squarely with our goal of providing brand-new, high-quality homes at affordable prices. This is workforce housing with a single-family lifestyle.  
To expand on the potential to provide real home ownership to a broader base of families, we have focused on developing a rent-to-own program for scattered home purchases within the Upward America Venture. We are in the final stages of developing this program with [ Divi ], a LENx portfolio company. [ Divi ] is a market leader in upward mobility for renters across the country. We expect this program to be up and running in the third quarter. We are very excited with the progress we've made so far with LSFR. The demand for single-family rental homes remain strong. Lease-up times are compressing, and we have seen real rent growth. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to John."
30763,717301504,2322841,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 17, 2021",2021-06-17,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Rick.

Today, I'm going to walk you through 2 topics: how we execute on our asset-light land strategy for a just-in-time delivery system of homesites and how we are managing the current unprecedented challenges of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. As Stuart noted, Lennar has made significant strides in strengthening our balance sheet with improved cash flow generation, driven primarily by the reduction in land owned versus optioned in the years of land owned, which respectively stand at 50% option and 3.3 years. 
In the second quarter, we added about 38,000 homesites net to our controlled total and purchased about 21,500 homesites. We began our asset-light focus years ago, starting with several large regional land relationships who own and develop land on Lennar's behalf. We then created a strategic national process around our approach. The first critical step in formulating this approach was to separate land into 3 distinct risk categories. 
The first category is finished land that is ready for the construction of homes to be started. The second is land under development being readied for the first category is typically less than 4 to 5 years from being ready for construction starts. Land in the third category is beyond the 4- to 5-year period that may need some entitlement, significant planning and has not yet started development. After separating land into these 3 buckets, we then match the risk profile of each asset with the right source of risk-adjusted capital and expertise. 
The first category of land is carried on our balance sheet as it is the land under the homes we are building. This land has no risk to it, and our cash on hand or revolver are the lowest cost of capital for it. The second and third categories of land are structured as option agreements with various strategic relationships that have the strength in capital that fit the specific land profile. Assets that are low in risk profile may go into land banks, which have the next lowest cost of capital. Other more complex land is a good fit for our large regional relationships. 
More recently, we have added significantly larger national relationships structured to match the type of land asset and also contractually structured option agreements, which will survive potential market shocks that has historically created risk through defaulting on option deposits and to maintaining control of the option land, thus further reducing risk. 
The distinct land business is compromised -- sorry, this distinct land business is compromised of an operational team with a singular focus on executing our asset-light strategy by closely coordinating with our local division teams and our strategic third-party relationships. This independent team works to ensure a consistent application of processes and procedures to execute on all of the moving pieces from land underwriting to acquisition, development and completion of just-in-time homesites. 
Importantly, the independence of this team takes the burden off of our homebuilding divisions of negotiating unique individual option agreements with third parties, thereby allowing our divisions to be laser-focused on running our core homebuilding operations. It also provides all of our third-party relationships the ability to work with one voice from a large geographically diverse company. Our focus on separating our land purchases into these 3 distinct risk buckets has allowed us to secure the most cost-effective capital for each land asset. As a result, we are lowering Lennar's cost and risk associated with purchasing each category of land. 
Now I'd like to discuss how Lennar is managing the current environment of supply chain disruptions. You are all familiar with what is occurring. The supply chain has been impacted by the pandemic, by the storms in Texas and by the surge in demand from new construction and big box retailers. Many manufacturers are finding themselves without the materials and/or capacity to keep up with their orders. Additionally, there's a nationwide shortage of trucks and drivers that add to the disruption. As you would expect at Lennar, we have brought an intense daily focus on managing this situation. 
We are effectively managing it through leveraging our strategic supply chain relationships as well as having an unprecedented internal connectivity between our division, regional and national purchasing teams. Today, we work very closely with the leadership of our strategic supply partners as a result of having been focused on being their Builder of Choice over the 5 -- over the past 5 years. We have deeply -- we have been deeply involved and over time in developing relationships, processes and procedures to improve their businesses. This is not just lip service as over the past 5 years, Lennar's changed the way we run our business to improve the bottom lines of our strategic partners' businesses. 
Our actions have earned us the right to sit down with our strategic suppliers and find solutions to today's challenges. Sometimes, it's expediting orders and even warehousing early deliveries. In some cases, it's substituting products. But in all situations, we, together with our partners, are finding solutions. The net effect of these disruptions is about a 2-week increase to our cycle times. 
With respect to our local trade partners, the shortage of labor persists now more than ever. Like the supply chain situation, we have brought an intense daily focus to manage this. Again, our Builder of Choice focus for the past 5-plus years is paying dividends. We've also changed the way we do business with our local building trades over this period of time. Significantly, we have refined the forecasting and communication of starts and have implemented Lennar's level-scheduling program for greater visibility of the upcoming workloads for our trade partners. Today, we now have real-time dashboards showing exactly how many tasks each trade has in the coming weeks and months. This enables them to accurately plan for their labor needs and keep our job sites productive. We believe these dashboards to be a best-in-class forecasting and communication solution. 
Also significant for both our suppliers and our local trade partners is our adherence to Lennar's Everything's Included program. This has never been more important. It simplifies the number of SKUs our suppliers and local trades need to carry. In addition, in this current environment, we've taken further steps to reduce the number of SKUs we use in certain constrained categories. 
Other areas of focus for us are using our level-scheduling dashboards to support our ongoing even flow commitment to our trade partners, along with maintaining our production-first focus on matching sales to starts, as Rick discussed. 
Turning to the cost impacts from the combination of supply chain disruptions, the spike in lumber and trade shortages. Our construction costs in the second quarter were up 3.9% sequentially and 4.5% year-over-year. However, even as construction costs increased, they decreased as a percent of revenues from 41.8% and 44.5% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively, down to 41.3% in our second quarter. With respect to lumber specifically, we all know that lumber reached an all-time high before very recently coming off of that. 
Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted, and Diane will cover in more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this, and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our -- on lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we will see a more significant benefit for our August starts. 
Lastly, I want to thank the associates of our national land team, led by Casey Davis and Jim Bavouset, with close coordination with all of our division land teams, effectively executed our land-light strategy and just-in-time homesite delivery strategy. I also want to thank our national, regional and division purchasing associates led by Kemp Gillis, who had the difficult job of battling through these unprecedented supply chain disruptions, has done so with tremendous focus, effort and poise. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane."

Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain Q2 2021 highlights and then providing detailed guidance for Q3 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021. 
So starting with homebuilding. For the quarter, new orders totaled 17,157 homes, a 32% increase year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 24,741 homes in backlog with a dollar value of $11 billion and 1,225 active communities. Our cancellation rate was 8.6%. For the quarter, deliveries totaled 14,493 homes, up 14% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 26.1%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on maximizing sales price, while controlling cost increases, as Jon described. Additionally, our margins benefited by a 20 basis point decrease in interest expense as compared to the prior year as a result of our consistent focus on debt reduction. 
Our SG&A was 7.6%, an improvement of 70 basis points from the prior year. This decrease is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform. So for the quarter, we generated a net margin of 18.5%, the highest quarter net margin of ERP. 
Our financial services team also executed at high levels, reporting $121 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $92 million compared to $81 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited from an increase in secondary margins. Title operations -- title operating earnings were $24 million compared to $76 million in the prior year. The prior year included a gain of $61 million on the deconsolidation of  states title now called Doma. Excluding this gain, title earnings increased due to growth in both volume and the margins as technology initiatives improved agency productivity. 
And then turning to our Lennar Other segment. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our residential solar platform to Sunnova Energy International in exchange for shares in that company. At the time of the closing, we recorded a gain of $151 million. We are required to mark-to-market our investment in Sunnova as well as our investment in Opendoor, which went public in our first quarter, at each quarter end based on their stock prices at that time. Accordingly, we recorded mark-to-market losses in the second quarter of approximately [ $276 million ]. 
And now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset-lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating significant homebuilding cash flow. 
At quarter end, we owned 189,000 homesites and controlled 192,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increasing to 50% from 32% in the prior year, thus achieving our controlled percentage goal midyear instead of end of year. All of this progress resulted in achieving a 20% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing all of our returns. During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares totaling $98 million. 
At quarter end, our homebuilding debt-to-total capital was 23.1%, down from 31.2% in the prior year. After quarter end, in fact, just this week, we retired early at par our $300 million 6.25% senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our senior note balance and saving about $9 million in interest. Our next maturity, $600 million due in January 2022, has a 3-month par call, which we will utilize to prepay those notes in October of this year. After that payment, we will have no senior note maturities until October 2022. 
And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $20 billion from $17 billion in Q2 of the prior year, and our book value per share increased to $62.68 from $52.98 in the prior year. 
And finally, last week, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We are really pleased with the rating agency upgrades we have achieved in recent months and are now investment grade in all 3 -- with all 3 agencies. 
So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong, and we will, of course, continue to remain focused on generating high returns for our shareholders. 
So with that brief overview, now let's turn to guidance. I'll first provide detailed guidance for the third quarter and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 16,300 homes and our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 15,800 to 16,100 homes. Our Q3 average sales price should be between $420,000 and $425,000. We expect our gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for Q3, and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q3 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. 
And then looking at our Other business segments. For Financial Services, we believe our Financial Services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. And for our multifamily operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. 
And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Now note that this guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments on our current or future publicly traded technology investments. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues. And our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 310 million shares. And so when you put all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32 per share for the quarter. 
And now let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year. We believe our average sales price for the year will be about $420,000, and we still expect our community count to increase approximately 10% year-over-year by year-end. Our Financial Services earnings will be in the range of $460 million to $470 million. And finally, our tax rate should be about 23.5%. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategy, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for an excellent year. 
And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

And I think there's been concerns specifically around the potential for demand slowing a little bit in the face of the extraordinary amount of home price appreciation that's occurred over the last several months. Stuart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you view that sales have been slowing more due to, in effect, production constraints and managing the sales pace. I was hoping for any sense of how you view demand as it progressed throughout the quarter. And what makes you comfortable around the idea that overall, the demand backdrop remains not only robust, but it appears still well in excess of available supply?"

So when you go from extremely, extremely hot to extremely hot, that's a step down that is really quite acceptable. It's actually a little bit better. And of course, as pricing goes up, people -- fewer people can afford. 
So I would just say, Mike, that while the market might have a mild cooling, it is just from such a high level that demand is still well in excess of supply. And we see this on the ground at our Welcome Home Centers on a regular basis. And this is not in any specific market, it really is across the country. 
So when we look at the temperament, the tempo of sales in our Welcome Home Centers, the traffic that's coming in, the discussions that we're having, we're still seeing very strong demand. We still see very limited supply, and we recognize that the country and the production of housing has been in deficit for the better part of a decade. And we can argue whether the deficit is one size or another. I think that there are a lot of competing views on that. But still, based on what we see in the market and the logic that we're applying to what we've seen over the past years and the appetite of the buying public, the millennials that still haven't come out of their parents' homes, we think there's a very, very strong demand profile that is out there for an extended period of time."

Secondly, I think perhaps the other key area of debate out there right now is around the sustainability of gross margins. And with the success that you've highlighted this year in terms of managing sales pace and opportunistically improving margin, and obviously, a part of that is to cover cost inflation, but you've been able to do well in excess of that. It's interesting right now that the gross margins you're projecting for '21 are in excess of the prior peak margins in 2005. Interestingly, you're on track to have revenue -- homebuilding revenue more than double 2005. And so you'd think that there are scale benefits certainly associated with that. 
But I was wondering if you could give any perhaps thoughts on how you think about gross margins going forward over the next couple of years. Obviously, I'm not asking for guidance for '22. But just more broadly, when you think about the gross margin levels that you're generating for this year, what might be the puts and takes outside of sales incentives, which are hard to predict? How do you see gross margins, let's say, this cycle and perhaps over the next couple of years versus the last cycle?"

I mean, if you look at the composition of our margin, it is a combination of a lot more efficiency in the way that we're managing our company, the technologies that we're engaging in and incorporating into the way that we're running our business; the efficiency of our land program, just-in-time delivery of land; and frankly, the emergent inventory management component of our single-family for rent component. There are tremendous efficiencies that we are embedding in the core operation of our business. And we think that these are becoming more and more important. 
The way that we're managing our supply chain is a matter of absolute efficiencies being brought into the way that we're operating our business. And you're going to see that we, as a company and hopefully as an industry, are recasting the cost structure all the way from hard cost, labor, materials to the softer costs around SG&A. We are rewiring the way that this business operates to the benefit of a lower cost structure and an opportunity to maintain good margins and still bring affordability to the housing market. And I think that, that's been an extreme part of our program. 
I do want to highlight that additionally, wind at our backs is our reduced debt level. As we bring debt down, we have less capital cost, and that's continuing to help our margin picture. And we expect to continue to bring that debt level down. 
So all of the components, from technology, the way we run our business, debt levels, the way that we're just in -- we're becoming more of a just-in-time program, I think is a protective coating around margins for the future, and we're pretty optimistic about where we're going."

But my questions are going to focus on the core homebuilding business. In this environment where you're deliberately, in some cases, holding back sales to age your work in process inventory, it seems like the best indication of future sales isn't actually the number of homes you're selling today but how many homes you're building. And given that, I noticed that your starts in 2Q were up about 28% from 1Q. The nation's starts were only up 7% sequentially, not seasonally adjusted. So clearly, you're gaining a lot of share. You've started -- I think the actual number was like over 20,000 units in the quarter. And I would think your production capability should increase from here because your community count is increasing. So my question is basically, is it reasonable to think that before too long, your closings should be able to exceed 20,000 units in a quarter?"

Very sensible strategy, I would say. The second question relates to home prices. I think the most striking development across the market has been this massive surge in home prices, not just that you're experiencing, but across the market. According to some measures, resale pricing is up 25% year-over-year. 
When people hear this, and they instinctively think it's a setup for home prices to fall in the future, which, by the way, would set off a pretty bad chain of events if it happened, our own view is that the price jump is a correction rather than an overshoot. It's the result of years of undersupply and pent-up demand and not just low interest rates. And so it makes it very different from like '05, like when demand was very speculative and supply wasn't constrained. But I think people would really like to hear from you how you see the longer-term outlook for pricing. Are we seeing a blow off peak like what happened recently to lumber futures or something? Or have we found a new level of home price that can be resilient in the face of potentially higher rates?"

I think I wouldn't have thought of it as a correction, but the way that you've said it, I think that, that makes sense. I think that home prices are and have reached a point and are continuing to grow, by the way. This is not -- this hasn't slowed. But the home prices have clear -- are reaching a point where it is kind of a correction to a higher price level. I think it's stagnated for a very long period of time as we went through the underproduction years and maybe the mortgage market kind of disabled the production and the demand for homes or certainly early after the downturn. 
But you have this really interesting time where not only has the mortgage market normalized, and I think normalized in a very credible way, very protective of that mortgage market, but you also have this really interesting demand coming from single-family for rent. And there's some questions around single-family for rent in interesting ways, but single-family for rent is enabling a single-family lifestyle to a broader range of people who cannot necessarily acquire the down payment or meet the metrics that are needed to qualify for a mortgage, but certainly have the ability to afford the rent on a single-family lifestyle. 
And this notion that the way that people live, the housing that is available to a broader range of people is -- its very predictive of outcomes for families. It's a really important component that's emergent. And the enablement of the single-family for rent business is just enabling homes available to a broader range, a bigger part of the population, and I think this is a greater good. And we believe, and I think Rick daylighted it and highlighted it very well, we believe that when we're providing more workforce housing, we're expanding the amount of demand that's out there. And yes, we're driving costs up or the price of housing up a little bit. That is driving the cost of housing up because there's more demand and less supply. But at the same time, it's asking the industry to provide more and provide more accessibility to more people. I think that's a generally great impact for the industry."

And the program that we're really working on is saying, okay, so housing affordability might be out of the reach of some people. 
How do we bring it in the reach through a rental program? And then how do we start to build a rental program that provides upward mobility so that renter can start to become an owner earning the credentials to get there? When you can make single-family lifestyle available to our workforce, and that workforce starts with a rental and can earn into owning it, it just creates a stepping stone, and it enables that workforce to afford that higher-priced home.

We've seen, I think, at the beginning stages of the pullback in lumber costs, a pullback in demand from the big box retailers as the do-it-yourself market postponed projects for 2 reasons. One is for post-pandemic, they're spending money and their time elsewhere and they didn't want to pay that high cost. So there's been a pullback on demand on the lumber supply chain, which has started to bring costs down from the unsustainable levels. 
So as we think about it, every 10% reduction in random lengths equates to about plus or minus $1,700 of our average size home. And same thing for OSB, about the same, about another $1,700 per home. So as you see it drop from the level of a high of $1,500, we'd expect probably our August starts to see a benefit of $200 to $300 a thousand board feet in random lengths. OSB, less than that, as it has not started coming down yet, but it should follow suit."

And we have joining us also Rick Beckwitt, who's on the road, I believe, in Dallas today, and Rick will be joining and contributing as well. 
So listen, today's call is pretty straightforward. So we're going to try to keep our remarks relatively brief so we have plenty of time for your questions, as usual. I'll give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick's going to talk about market strength and land and community count. Jon will update on the popular supply chain, production, construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can. 
And as usual, please limit to 1 question and 1 follow-up. So let me begin and start on our singular low note. As you saw in our press release, we missed the low end of our third quarter delivery guidance by 600 homes, delivering 15,199 homes. And while at Lennar, we're certainly not immune to supply chain disruption, we are simply not used to missing either. 
While our entire team feels the pain of this miss, it is not for lack of effort or focus that we miss, but instead, it's a reflection of the current market conditions. The supply chain for both land and construction is significantly stressed and that will continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. 
Accordingly, we expect our community count at the end of the year will be up only approximately 7% versus the 10% we previously guided, and our deliveries will be approximately 18,000 a versus the 19,000 to 21,000 we previously guided. And while we're not giving specific guidance for 2022, we fully expect double-digit growth in sales, starts, closings and community count next year. 
After my introductory remarks, Rick will further address the land and supply chain and our performance and expectations, and Jon will give color on labor and materials and the effects on production. 
So except for the miss on deliveries, our third quarter results were very strong and quite extraordinary. Even with the supply chain constraint, we still grew our deliveries 10% year-over-year, while our revenues from home sales grew 19% to over $6.5 billion. And by remaining focused on orderly targeted growth, with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 420 basis point gross margin improvement from 23.1% last year to 27.3% this year. 
Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 100 basis points to 7% this year versus 8% last year, and that's without the embedded leverage of the missed closings. Accordingly, our net margin increased 520 basis points year-over-year from 15.1% last year to a company all-time high at 20.3% in our third quarter. 
This drove a 54% after-tax and before extraordinary items, bottom line improvement in net earnings from approximately $667 million last year to over $1 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom line over top line improvement, 19% revenue growth drove 54% bottom line growth. 
Our net new orders grew 5% year-over-year even as we have matched our sales pace with production pace in this constrained environment and in spite of the difficult comparison to last year's strong recovery of fourth quarter numbers. 
Additionally, our financial services group continued to perform exceptionally, adding $112 million of earnings while supporting the orderly closings of our homes and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment. 
With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continue to improve as well, even after the purchase of 2.5 million shares of stock and the reduction of $350 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.6 billion and a 21.2% debt-to-total capital ratio, while our return on equity grew 800 basis points to 21.9%. 
All in all, our core operating numbers are very strong, and we expect this strength to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. Of course, in addition to our core, we have generated additional upside this quarter by some of our LENx investments, which entered the public markets. While market conditions resulted in lower valuations for these companies by our quarter end and those include Doma, Title, Hippo Home Insurance, Blend mortgage processing and SmartRent automated entry systems we still recorded just under $500 million of profit from those investments. 
So even though we are guiding down our deliveries for the next quarter we are decidedly guiding the prospects for Lennar's continued success up as we continue to build on the core strategies that define our business and Diane will give more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter but our expectations reflect overall strength in the market and optimism for our future. 
From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong, and these continue to be the best of times. Demand has been consistently strong, while the supply of new and existing homes remains limited. Since new home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that persisted over the last decade, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come. 
Even though home prices have moved much higher -- have moved much higher, the overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and personal savings for departs strong. Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. And while inflation numbers might seem to tell a different story,  this is the story that we're hearing from our customers as they come to visit our field offices. 
The primary driver of demand continues to be an upward spiral of housing consumer needs. Millennials are forming families. Apartment dwellers are purchasing first-time homes. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling at higher prices and anticipated -- and appreciated equity is enabling first-time move-ups. 
Yesterday's move-up home is selling its strong pricing with increased equity enabling customers to consider and purchase an even larger home.  All this while supply is limited for everyone. Additionally, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace. The iBuyers are providing liquidity while becoming an essential convenience provider at the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. 
The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself. 
The single-family for rent participants are also providing more liquidity while making a single-family home lifestyle accessible to more families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is building more housing and making a growing portion of that housing stock available to more families to rent if they can't yet meet the requirements for homeownership. 
Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single-family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own.  Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families and the industry is rewiring to provide those solutions. As noted before, changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality of the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is very strong, and we the builders just have to get the homes built. 
Before I conclude, let me briefly talk about our spin company that I have to briefly described in the past. As you can see, from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo is becoming more and more compelling. We have adequate and even excess capacity to spin our well-established ancillary businesses. And those businesses and business lines do not meaningfully contribute to our core earnings in their current ownership configuration right now. 
In effect, these assets as currently positioned are actually dilutive to our growing returns on equity and returns on capital. With an effective spin, the remaining Lennar Corporation can drive higher return assets and equity base, and we are pushing to make that happen. 
But as you would expect, we are determined to get it right and construct SpinCo as a stand-alone company that is investable, that is accountable, scalable and successful in its own right. 
The already successful business of SpinCo can and will be structured for success and accountability and form the beginning of a growth story that matches the success of Lennar. Accordingly, we have continued to work on the structure, components and organization of the new company. 
Time has continued to be our friend in that the Lennar core business the Lennar cash flow and balance sheet have continued to improve and provide even greater opportunity and flexibility. Accordingly, I am once again to your disappointment, I'm sure you're going to kick the can on delivering more detail on SpinCo. 
While nothing has changed in our expected execution and scope, the detail of standing up a new public company is time-consuming and complex, and we do not want to detail an incomplete picture or miss an opportunity to just get it right. To that end, this quarter, we engaged a new participant, Matt Zames, as a senior adviser to the company, focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. 
Matt is a seasoned veteran in the financial services world as a past President of Cerberus Capital and as a past Chief Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. Matt's expertise in operations, execution and detailed financial modeling will help quickly advance the time line for SpinCo and help bring it to market. 
Matt is not a newcomer to Lennar as we have worked with him through our very successful various advisory engagements with Cerberus and I personally serve with and format on the Board of Doma where Matt serves as an extraordinary Chair of the Board. 
In addition to when supporting that, we have sequestered a team of senior internal leaders under the focused leadership of Jeff McCall to work with Matt on the substance and structure of the new company. This team meets regularly to map the structure, model expected growth and review progress. We are standing up a new company backbone and the team includes all the leaders from the projected Spinco verticals. 
As last -- as noted last quarter, our SpinCo will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business verticals. As noted, 2 of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and active asset managers, LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management and is raising its third fund right now. 
LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.25 billion of equity already raised. Both of these programs are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business that has been refining -- that has been refined, and we have a growing technology investment business that, as you can see from our numbers, is performing exceptionally well under the name LENx. 
As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that in spite of the miss of deliveries and the supply chain disruption that is affecting us and the industry, we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. 
Demand and the market in general remained very strong even as we return to traditional seasonality in our overall annual sales pace. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar in the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited. 
And of course, given the supply chain challenges the industry will not be able to quickly remedy the supply shortage with increased production. Accordingly, we expect the market to remain in its current balance or should I say, imbalance for an extended period of time. 
We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, therefore, driving our net margin. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our SFR single-family for rent program. 
We have focused on cash flow, on debt reduction and stock buyback and land-owned versus controlled return on capital and return on equity and, of course, driving incremental upside from investments in and upside on our innovative technologies. 
We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them at the same time. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit and the market condition remains extremely strong for the foreseeable future. 
As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for Lennar. The story remains that supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move, it feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early and the industry is building through those sales slower than expected. 
We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that",1057,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. 
Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this appreciated market with slightly longer cycle times caused by supply chain issues, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to maximize prices and offset potential cost increases. 
Our third quarter results prove out the success of the strategy as we achieved gross margin increases of 420 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. During the third quarter, we started 4.9 homes per community, sold 4.5 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 200 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. 
This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin and lead to increased deliveries in fiscal 2022, given the ramp up in starts in the third quarter. In the third quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were strong in each of our operating regions, with August being the strongest month in the quarter. 
In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry level to move up to active adult. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 10% in the quarter, down 470 basis points from last year. In the third quarter, we continued to achieve price increases, although at a lower rate than earlier in the year. 
In general, the market has moderated from being extremely hot to a strong market that is returning to normal seasonal trends. Here's some color on some of our stronger markets. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is being driven -- which is driving both sales pace and price. 
Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to close. The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami Dade and Broward in the Southeast and Tampa. We are also seeing a strong recovery in Orlando with the increase in tourism. These markets -- these are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions. 
Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets benefited from -- benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We're the top builder in each of these markets. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth, especially on the technology set. 
The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector. Notwithstanding out-migration from parts of California, the markets are strong in California, driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing migration from other California coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability compounded with the ability to buy a larger home for the money in those markets. 
Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. The casinos in Las Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability. 
These are some of the strongest markets, but as I said, there is strength and depth of market across the country. Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. While our community count is up slightly from the beginning of the year, we ended the quarter flat on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by a faster sales pace in certain existing communities which caused some communities to close out sooner than expected. 
Our community count was also impacted by delays in getting new communities open because of supply chain-type issues and municipalities being overwhelmed with short staff due to the Delta variant and not being able to process the entitlements, permitting and inspections on a timely basis. Similar to the supply chain delays experienced by our homebuilding operations, land issues are not caused by any operational failures, but instead by various external forces.  
The impacts of COVID from quarantine of sick workers to the necessary workplace modifications to ensure compliance with safety protocols had severely hampered many municipalities ability to timely process approvals and conduct inspections. Likewise, the active tropical basin this year caused not only site-specific land development delays but added to the logistical supply chain channels that already existed, primarily associated with PVC, drainage structures and valves. 
The snowball effect of these delays combined with the shortage of crews due to COVID quarantines really slowed down the process. While these challenges persist, we are proactively managing these challenges. With all this in mind, we now expect to end the year with a 7% increase in community count versus the 10% we targeted at the beginning of the year. While we are disappointed with these delays, we know this is just a timing thing and that these communities will come online. 
On a more positive note, our land pipeline remains robust with plenty of land in the queue to meet our growth goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets, and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned or controlled. 
We're also pleased with the excellent progress we're making on our land life strategy, as evidenced by our years owned supply of homesites improving to 3.3 years at the end of the third quarter from 3.8 years at last year's third quarter and our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 53% from 35% for the same periods. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their tireless efforts as we've worked through these challenges associated with the supply chain. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon."
30763,1680642046,2399689,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick. I will now briefly address how we are managing through the supply chain disruptions that are impacting on Lennar and the industry, and we'll answer any detailed questions you have in the Q&A. As Stuart noted, our closing miss for Q3 was dr",965,"Thanks, Rick. I will now briefly address how we are managing through the supply chain disruptions that are impacting on Lennar and the industry, and we'll answer any detailed questions you have in the Q&A. 
As Stuart noted, our closing miss for Q3 was driven by supply chain disruptions that led to a general increase in our cycle time to homes, but also some intermittent shortages that stall production beyond cycle time, causing these closings to be delayed into our fourth quarter. 
As you've heard from various building product companies, and from other homebuilders, disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They are intermittent, and they are not over yet. In many ways, it's truly a game of wack-a-mole, creating a traffic jam.  Like cars, the construction process is backed up, creating a chain reaction of delay that cascades from 1 trade to the next. The team at Lennar is apply dealing with the situation to manage for the best possible outcomes. Like the rest of the industry, we not only saw our cycle time increase approximately 2 weeks in our third quarter, but we also had additional surprises that quickly changed delivery dates. 
Fortunately, at Lennar, we have extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams that are very coordinated and are managing our scheduling on a day-by-day basis in partnership with each of our trade partners. We work with our partners to solve the issues in real time as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. 
Our decades-long platform of everything is included has minimized the impact of supply chain shortages as we have fewer SKUs to manage and we can plan out material needs far in advance. This has become more important than ever as lead times have materially expanded for most manufacturers. 
Additionally, we're now in our sixth year of focusing on being the Builder of Choice for our trade partners. Over this time span, we have rewired interactions with our building partners to help them manage their cost inputs, reduce their labor needs and enable them to grow. This has earned us a seat at the table with our strategic trade partners in these stressful times to work through solutions partner by partner. 
Even where the solution is bringing in alternative manufacturers, this is done in a collaborative manner with our existing partners to help them versus hurt them. We are doing a better job than ever at a time when it was most needed in communicating with our trade partners and giving them detailed forecasting information. 
Let me give you a quick sense of where the greatest impacts are being felt right now. From a national manufacturing perspective, the categories most impacted are engineered wood, windows, garage doors, paint and vinyl siding. On a regional basis, it is brick and lumber capacity in Texas, concrete block in Central Florida, insulation in North and Southwest Florida and in Phoenix and Minnesota, it's severe labor constraints. 
We believe we'll feel the effects of this backup for the next few quarters and then based on the plans we have in place with all of our trade partners, we would expect to see stabilization in our cycle times by Q2 of 2022. As mentioned in our quote, we remain focused on consistently increasing our start pace. And in the third quarter, we averaged 4.9 homes per community, up from 4.2 homes per community last year or 17,630 homes started in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. 
This positions us well for growth in 2022. And as discussed earlier, we are in regular communication with our entire supply chain in advance of these starts in order to support this increase in activity. The construction cost impact in our third quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year that are now impacting costs as homes close. 
In the third quarter, costs were up $5.40 per square foot over the third quarter last year, and lumber accounted for about 95% of that increase. We will see increased costs from lumber, although at lower level in Q4 and Q1, with lumber cost reductions thereafter. In various other product categories, cost increases have been pushed in the second and third quarters as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. 
These increases will flow through closing starting Q1 of 2022 but will be offset by the reduction in lumber costs, resulting in a net reduction in costs by Q2. As we have noted in prior quarters, our revenues are growing at a faster pace than construction cost increases, resulting in a decrease in construction cost as a percent of revenues to 41.4% compared to 43.6% last year. 
Overall, the Lennar management team is focused daily on managing through the current supply chain disruptions. It is a truly all hands on deck. Stuart, Rick, our regional presidents and myself support Kemp Gillis and our supply chain team by joining them in meetings with the leadership of key trade partners. In these meetings, we listen and learn, understand challenges and then craft solutions. We review production needs for the weeks and months ahead, implement our solutions and then execute as partners. 
This pattern of execution combined with maintaining our disciplines of everything included in Builder of Choice platforms with an additional focus on further SKU reductions and enhanced communications allows us to be nimble in responding to and managing through this environment. 
As we look ahead, there are bumpy parts of the road and a traffic jam or [ 2 ] to work through, both increased starts and much appreciated cooperation from our trade partners, we are setting up for solid growth in deliveries in 2022. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane."
30763,1680642046,2399689,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilder performance.

So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilder performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then provide detailed guidance for Q4 of 2021. 
So starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our financial services team reported $112 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $80 million compared to $113 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refi volumes have declined. 
As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. Our third quarter was negatively impacted by lower secondary margins compared to the prior year and was the primary driver for the decrease in mortgage operating. Title operating earnings increased to $26 million compared to $21 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to the growth in both volume and profit per transaction. Our Title team has been laser-focused on technology, automation and efficiencies with the goal of driving higher productivity. So then turning to our Lennar other segment. For the third quarter, Lennar Other segment had operating earnings of $492 million. The driver of the earnings was LENx, which is our growing technology investment business. 3 of our LENx investments, Hippo, SmartRent and Blend went public, as Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, and we recognized mark-to-market gains of $433 million on these investments. 
We also had mark-to-market gains of $61 million on our existing public investments, Opendoor and Sunnova. And as a side note, we do have an investment in Doma Holdings, which also went public in the third quarter, However, we do not utilize mark-to-market accounting for this investment, primarily because of our level of ownership. 
If we have marked the investment to market, the unrealized gain would have been $638 million. Again, this does not appear in our P&L or balance sheet just a noteworthy point. So you can see that LENx continues to, first and foremost, add value to our core homebuilding operations but also provides potential upside with investment earnings. 
Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash, and this is after deploying almost $600 million to retire debt really and buy back stock, which I'll discuss in a minute. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and home generating significant homebuilding cash flow and improving returns. At quarter end, we owned 190,000 homesites and controlled 216,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.8 years in the prior year in our homesites controlled percentage increasing to 53% from 35% in the prior year. 
All this progress resulted in achieving a 23% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing oil returns. During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 2.5 million shares totaling $246 million. 
This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 4 million shares totaling $388 million. We also retired early our $300 million 6.25 senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our debt balance and saving about $9 million in interest as we utilize the 6-month par call future. 
Our next maturity, $60 million due in January 2022 as a 3-month par call, which we will also utilize to prepay the notes next month. This will leave us with no senior note maturities until October 2022. Additionally, during the quarter, we also paid off $50 million of other nonpublic homebuilding debt. So when you pull all this together at quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 21.2%, down from 29.5% in the prior year. 
And then a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $21 billion from $17 billion in the prior year, and our book value per share increased to 66.73 from 54.91 in the prior year. Our return on equity was 22% compared to 14% a year ago. 
And finally, in June, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P and are now investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. We are extremely proud of the status with the agencies and believe it reflects the successful execution of our operating strategy as well as our very strong balance sheet. 
And so with that brief overview, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 15,200 to 15,400 homes as we return to more seasonal patterns. And we expect our deliveries, as we've said, to be about 18,000. Now this estimate has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges bring a great deal of uncertainty.  The final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes to the same issues, which, of course, we are navigating each and every day. 
Our Q4 average sales price should be about 445,000 as we continue to see price appreciation. We expect our gross margin to be about 28% and we expect our SG&A to be about 6.7%. However, once again, these amounts will move up or down a bit depending on the number of homes delivered. 
And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q4 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Then turning to our other business segments. We believe our financial services earnings for Q4 will be in the range of $95 million to $105 million as market competition for purchased business continues. 
We expect our multifamily operations to be about breakeven. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect earnings in the range of $5 million to $10 million. This guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our mark-to-market investments since this will be determined by their stock price at the end of our quarter. 
We expect Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.2% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.8% and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 306 million shares. And so when you all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $4.12 to $4.16 per share for the fourth quarter. 
And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned to have a strong end to our fiscal 2021. 
And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions."

Stuart, 3 months ago,  we talked about how it might be more accurate to describe the move in home prices that the industry and you have seen over the past year as a correction upward since home prices rose in order to reduce demand down to the depressed level of supply, there was a gap between supply and demand. 
And so this quarter, you've talked about in your opening remarks, demand as being at a more normal seasonal level. But it's also fair to say that supply constraints have worsened 2. So basically, at this point, what I'm asking is, would you say that demand is still above supply and then home prices are still generally rising. And more specifically, maybe how did demand respond to pricing actions you took over the summer? And how would you say things are trending thus far in September?"

I would clearly say that demand is above supply. And therein, you see pricing power. But at the same time, the kind of conflict that you're daylighting is that if you think about the sales pattern of last year, it stalled in and around COVID and then picked up very sharply as you went into the third and fourth quarters. And so your comparisons are relative to a kind of catch-up that was embedded in sales numbers back at that time. 
So yes, you still have very strong demand. You have very strong sales. You're not catching up anymore. And because you have short supply and a delivery system or a production system that is slowed by the supply chain, that demand is clearly outstripping supply. You still see pricing power. But comparisons are kind of tepid in terms of seeing sales growth because nobody wants to get way out ahead of what they can actually produce. 
When you ask about pricing over the past -- over the summertime. And how has that moderated sales, and that's exactly what you're seeing in our numbers is pricing power, pricing pulling back on sales a little bit and keeping our sales in check with the actual production abilities that are out there. Is that helpful?"

Then of course, at some point, the market is going to start focusing more on 2022 and beyond. And so I wanted to -- my next question sort of gets to that. Jon, you gave some good numbers. I think you said $5.40 per square foot in terms of cost, with lumber being 95% of that increase. And you've laid out an expectation that by 2Q of next year, the decline in lumber cost will be greater than other inflationary forces that you see in your cost structure, which I assume is a fancy way of saying that margins -- gross margins could trend upwards. I wanted to make sure that I didn't oversimplify and that, that is actually what you were trying to convey. 
And then as a follow-on to that, I would ask generally maybe for Stuart, the outlook for gross margins is one of the major areas of disagreement in -- for -- the street for next year. And I was curious, my view is that a return to sort of normal season outlook, what you talked about in no way suggests that margins are going to quickly return back to some sort of historical norm in part because home prices have already reached a new level and land costs are embedded in your balance sheet already at a lower cost. 
I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about how margins may trend over the next few years if supply and demand starts to come more into balance, are we going to see margins quickly return? Or would we likely see some hang time here on the gross margins?"

The efficiencies that we're injecting in every part of our business all the way from marketing to realtor commissions, to the way that our construction operations are actually run. Every element of our business is being reworked and replumbed for efficiency, and it's reflecting quarter after quarter after quarter in our SG&A. So we think it's one of the most important things. We don't get enough questions about it. But it really is every quarter, incremental improvement. And we have some divisions that have just taken it to new levels.

And we have joining us also Rick Beckwitt, who's on the road, I believe, in Dallas today, and Rick will be joining and contributing as well. 
So listen, today's call is pretty straightforward. So we're going to try to keep our remarks relatively brief so we have plenty of time for your questions, as usual. I'll give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick's going to talk about market strength and land and community count. Jon will update on the popular supply chain, production, construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can. 
And as usual, please limit to one question and one follow-up. So let me begin and start on our singular low note. As you saw in our press release, we missed the low end of our third quarter delivery guidance by 600 homes, delivering 15,199 homes. And while at Lennar, we're certainly not immune to supply chain disruption, we are simply not used to missing either. 
While our entire team feels the pain of this miss. It is not for lack of effort or focus that we miss, but instead, it's a reflection of the current market conditions. The supply chain for both land and construction is significantly stressed and that will continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. 
Accordingly, we expect our community count at the end of the year will be up only approximately 7% versus the 10% we previously guided, and our deliveries will be approximately 18,000 versus the 19,000 to 21,000 we previously guided. And while we're not giving specific guidance for 2022, we fully expect double-digit growth in sales, starts, closings and community count next year. 
After my introductory remarks, Rick will further address the land and supply chain and our performance and expectations, and Jon will give color on labor and materials and the effects on production. 
So except for the miss on deliveries, our third quarter results were very strong and quite extraordinary. Even with the supply chain constraint, we still grew our deliveries 10% year-over-year, while our revenues from home sales grew 19% to over $6.5 billion. And by remaining focused on orderly targeted growth, with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 420 basis point gross margin improvement from 23.1% last year to 27.3% this year. 
Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 100 basis points to 7% this year versus 8% last year, and that's without the embedded leverage of the missed closings. Accordingly, our net margin increased 520 basis points year-over-year from 15.1% last year to a company all-time high at 20.3% in our third quarter. 
This drove a 54% after-tax and before extraordinary items, bottom line improvement in net earnings from approximately $667 million last year to over $1 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom line over top line improvement, 19% revenue growth drove 54% bottom line growth. 
Our net new orders grew 5% year-over-year even as we have matched our sales pace with production pace in this constrained environment and in spite of the difficult comparison to last year's strong recovery of fourth quarter numbers. 
Additionally, our financial services group continued to perform exceptionally, adding $112 million of earnings while supporting the orderly closings of our homes and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment. 
With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continue to improve as well, even after the purchase of 2.5 million shares of stock and the reduction of $350 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.6 billion and a 21.2% debt-to-total capital ratio, while our return on equity grew 800 basis points to 21.9%. 
All in all, our core operating numbers are very strong, and we expect this strength to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. Of course, in addition to our core, we have generated additional upside this quarter by some of our LENx investments, which entered the public markets. While market conditions resulted in lower valuations for these companies by our quarter end and those include Doma, Title, Hippo Home Insurance, Blend mortgage processing and SmartRent automated entry systems, we still recorded just under $500 million of profit from those investments. 
So even though we are guiding down our deliveries for the next quarter, we are decidedly guiding the prospects for Lennar's continued success up as we continue to build on the core strategies that define our business and Diane will give more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter but our expectations reflect overall strength in the market and optimism for our future. 
From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong, and these continue to be the best of times. Demand has been consistently strong, while the supply of new and existing homes remains limited. Since new home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that persisted over the last decade, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come. 
Even though home prices have moved much higher -- have moved much higher, the overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. And while inflation numbers might seem to tell a different story,  this is the story that we're hearing from our customers as they come to visit our field offices. 
The primary driver of demand continues to be an upward spiral of housing consumer needs. Millennials are forming families. Apartment dwellers are purchasing first-time homes. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling at higher prices and anticipated -- and appreciated equity is enabling first-time move-ups. 
Yesterday's move-up home is selling its strong pricing with increased equity enabling customers to consider and purchase an even larger home.  All this while supply is limited for everyone. Additionally, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace. The iBuyers are providing liquidity while becoming an essential convenience provider at the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself. 
The single-family for rent participants are also providing more liquidity while making a single-family home lifestyle accessible to more families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is building more housing and making a growing portion of that housing stock available to more families to rent, if they can't yet meet the requirements for homeownership. 
Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single-family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own. Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families and the industry is rewiring to provide those solutions. As noted before, changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality of the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is very strong, and we the builders just have to get the homes built. 
Before I conclude, let me briefly talk about our spin company that I have to briefly described in the past. As you can see, from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo is becoming more and more compelling. We have adequate and even excess capacity to spin our well-established ancillary businesses. And those businesses and business lines do not meaningfully contribute to our core earnings in their current ownership configuration right now. 
In effect, these assets as currently positioned are actually dilutive to our growing returns on equity and returns on capital. With an effective spin, the remaining Lennar Corporation can drive higher returns on our assets and equity base, and we are pushing to make that happen. 
But as you would expect, we are determined to get it right and construct SpinCo as a stand-alone company that is investable, that is accountable, scalable and successful in its own right. 
The already successful business of SpinCo can and will be structured for success and accountability and form the beginning of a growth story that matches the success of Lennar. Accordingly, we have continued to work on the structure, components and organization of the new company. 
Time has continued to be our friend in that the Lennar core business, the Lennar cash flow and balance sheet have continued to improve and provide even greater opportunity and flexibility. Accordingly, I am once again to your disappointment, I'm sure you're going to kick the can on delivering more detail on SpinCo. 
While nothing has changed in our expected execution and scope, the detail of standing up a new public company is time-consuming and complex, and we do not want to detail an incomplete picture or miss an opportunity to just get it right. To that end, this quarter, we engaged a new participant, Matt Zames, as a senior adviser to the company, focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. 
Matt is a seasoned veteran in the financial services world as a past President of Cerberus Capital and as a past Chief Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. Matt's expertise in operations, execution and detailed financial modeling will help quickly advance the time line for SpinCo and help bring it to market. 
Matt is not a newcomer to Lennar as we have worked with him through our very successful various advisory engagements with Cerberus and I personally serve with and format on the Board of Doma where Matt serves as an extraordinary Chair of the Board. 
In addition to when supporting Matt, we have sequestered a team of senior internal leaders under the focused leadership of Jeff McCall to work with Matt on the substance and structure of the new company. This team meets regularly to map the structure, model expected growth and review progress. We are standing up a new company backbone and the team includes all the leaders from the projected SpinCo verticals. 
As last -- as noted last quarter, our SpinCo will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business verticals. As noted, 2 of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management and is raising its third fund right now. 
LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.25 billion of equity already raised. Both of these programs are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business that has been refining -- that has been refined, and we have a growing technology investment business that, as you can see from our numbers, is performing exceptionally well under the name LENx. 
As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that in spite of the miss of deliveries and the supply chain disruption that is affecting us and the industry, we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. 
Demand and the market in general remained very strong even as we return to traditional seasonality in our overall annual sales pace. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar in the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited. 
And of course, given the supply chain challenges, the industry will not be able to quickly remedy the supply shortage with increased production. Accordingly, we expect the market to remain in its current balance or should I say, imbalance for an extended period of time. 
We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, therefore, driving our net margin. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our SFR single-family for rent program. 
We have focused on cash flow, on debt reduction and stock buyback, land-owned versus controlled return on capital and return on equity and, of course, driving incremental upside from investments and upside on our innovative technologies. 
We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them at the same time. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit and the market condition remains extremely strong for the foreseeable future. 
As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for Lennar. The story remains that supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move, it feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early and the industry is building through those sales slower than expected. 
We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come. 
With that, let me turn it over to Rick."

As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that",1058,"Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. 
Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this appreciated market with slightly longer cycle times caused by supply chain issues, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to maximize prices and offset potential cost increases. 
Our third quarter results prove out the success of the strategy as we achieved gross margin increases of 420 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. During the third quarter, we started 4.9 homes per community, sold 4.5 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 200 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. 
This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin and lead to increased deliveries in fiscal 2022, given the ramp up in starts in the third quarter. In the third quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were strong in each of our operating regions, with August being the strongest month in the quarter. 
In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry level to move up to active adult. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 10% in the quarter, down 470 basis points from last year. In the third quarter, we continued to achieve price increases, although at a lower rate than earlier in the year. 
In general, the market has moderated from being extremely hot to a strong market that is returning to normal seasonal trends. Here's some color on some of our stronger markets. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is being driven -- which is driving both sales pace and price. 
Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to close. The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami Dade and Broward in the Southeast and Tampa. We are also seeing a strong recovery in Orlando with the increase in tourism. These markets -- these are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions. 
Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets benefited from -- benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We're the top builder in each of these markets. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth, especially in the technology set. 
The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector. Notwithstanding out-migration from parts of California, the markets are strong in California, driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing migration from other California coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability compounded with the ability to buy a larger home for the money in those markets. 
Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. The casinos in Las Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability. 
These are some of the strongest markets, but as I said, there is strength and depth of market across the country. Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. While our community count is up slightly from the beginning of the year, we ended the quarter flat on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by a faster sales pace in certain existing communities which caused some communities to close out sooner than expected. 
Our community count was also impacted by delays in getting new communities open because of supply chain-type issues and municipalities being overwhelmed with short staff due to the Delta variant and not being able to process the entitlements, permitting and inspections on a timely basis. Similar to the supply chain delays experienced by our homebuilding operations, the land issues are not caused by any operational failures, but instead by various external forces.  
The impacts of COVID from quarantine of sick workers to the necessary workplace modifications to ensure compliance with safety protocols had severely hampered many municipalities ability to timely process approvals and conduct inspections. Likewise, the active tropical basin this year caused not only site-specific land development delays but added to the logistical supply chain channels that already existed, primarily associated with PVC, drainage structures and valves. 
The snowball effect of these delays combined with the shortage of crews due to COVID quarantines really slowed down the process. While these challenges persist, we are proactively managing these challenges. With all this in mind, we now expect to end the year with a 7% increase in community count versus the 10% we targeted at the beginning of the year. While we are disappointed with these delays, we know this is just a timing thing and that these communities will come online. 
On a more positive note, our land pipeline remains robust with plenty of land in the queue to meet our growth goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets, and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned or controlled. 
We're also pleased with the excellent progress we're making on our land light strategy, as evidenced by our years owned supply of homesites improving to 3.3 years at the end of the third quarter from 3.8 years at last year's third quarter and our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 53% from 35% for the same periods. 
Finally, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their tireless efforts as we've worked through these challenges associated with the supply chain. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon."
30763,1680642046,2399746,"Lennar Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick. I will now briefly address how we are managing through the supply chain disruptions that are impacting Lennar and the industry, and we'll answer any detailed questions you have in the Q&A. As Stuart noted, our closing miss for Q3 was drive",962,"Thanks, Rick. I will now briefly address how we are managing through the supply chain disruptions that are impacting Lennar and the industry, and we'll answer any detailed questions you have in the Q&A. 
As Stuart noted, our closing miss for Q3 was driven by supply chain disruptions that led to a general increase in our cycle time to build homes, but also some intermittent shortages that stall production beyond cycle time, causing these closings to be delayed into our fourth quarter. 
As you've heard from various building product companies, and from other homebuilders, disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They are intermittent, and they are not over yet. In many ways, it's truly a game of whack-a-mole, creating a traffic jam.  Like cars, construction process is backed up, creating a chain reaction of delay that cascades from one trade to the next. The team at Lennar is happily dealing with the situation to manage for the best possible outcomes. Like the rest of the industry, we not only saw our cycle time increase approximately 2 weeks in our third quarter, but we also had additional surprises that quickly changed delivery dates. 
Fortunately, at Lennar, we have extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams that are very coordinated and are managing our scheduling on a day-by-day basis in partnership with each of our trade partners. We work with our partners to solve the issues in real time as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. 
Our decades-long platform of everything is included has minimized the impact of supply chain shortages as we have fewer SKUs to manage and we can plan out material needs far in advance. This has become more important than ever as lead times have materially expanded for most manufacturers. 
Additionally, we're now in our sixth year of focusing on being the Builder of Choice for our trade partners. Over this time span, we have rewired interactions with our building partners to help them manage their cost inputs, reduce their labor needs and enable them to grow. This has earned us a seat at the table with our strategic trade partners in these stressful times to work through solutions partner by partner. 
Even where the solution is bringing in alternative manufacturers, this is done in a collaborative manner with our existing partners to help them versus hurt them. We are doing a better job than ever at a time when it was most needed in communicating with our trade partners and giving them detailed forecasting information. 
Let me give you a quick sense of where the greatest impacts are being felt right now. From a national manufacturing perspective, the categories most impacted are engineered wood, windows, garage doors, paint and vinyl siding. On a regional basis, it is brick and lumber capacity in Texas, concrete block in Central Florida, insulation in North and Southwest Florida and in Phoenix and Minnesota, it's severe labor constraints. 
We believe we'll fill the effects of this backup for the next few quarters and then based on the plans we have in place with all of our trade partners, we would expect to see stabilization in our cycle times by Q2 of 2022. As mentioned in our quote, we remained focused on consistently increasing our start pace. And in the third quarter, we averaged 4.9 homes per community, up from 4.2 homes per community last year or 17,630 homes started in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. 
This positions us well for growth in 2022. And as discussed earlier, we are in regular communication with our entire supply chain in advance of these starts in order to support this increase in activity. The construction cost impact in our third quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year that are now impacting costs as homes close. 
In the third quarter, costs were up $5.40 per square foot over the third quarter last year, and lumber accounted for about 95% of that increase. We will see increased costs from lumber, although at lower level in Q4 and Q1, with lumber cost reductions thereafter. In various other product categories, cost increases have been pushed in the second and third quarters as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. 
These increases will flow through closing starting Q1 of 2022 but will be offset by the reduction in lumber costs, resulting in a net reduction in costs by Q2. As we have noted in prior quarters, our revenues are growing at a faster pace than construction cost increases, resulting in a decrease in construction cost as a percent of revenues to 41.4% compared to 43.6% last year. 
Overall, the Lennar management team is focused daily on managing through the current supply chain disruptions. It is a truly all hands on deck. Stuart, Rick, our regional presidents and myself support Kemp Gillis and our supply chain team by joining them in meetings with the leadership of key trade partners. In these meetings, we listen and learn, understand challenges and then craft solutions. We review production needs for the weeks and months ahead, implement our solutions and then execute as partners. 
This pattern of execution combined with maintaining our disciplines of everything included in Builder of Choice platforms with an additional focus on further SKU reductions and enhanced communications allows us to be nimble in responding to and managing through this environment. 
As we look ahead, there are bumpy parts of the road and a traffic jam or 2  to work through, both increased starts and much appreciated cooperation from our trade partners, we are setting up for solid growth in deliveries in 2022. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane."

So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilder performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then provide detailed guidance for Q4 of 2021. 
So starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our financial services team reported $112 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $80 million compared to $113 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refi volumes have declined. 
As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. Our third quarter was negatively impacted by lower secondary margins compared to the prior year and was the primary driver for the decrease in mortgage operating earnings. Title operating earnings increased to $26 million compared to $21 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to the growth in both volume and profit per transaction. Our Title team has been laser-focused on technology, automation and efficiencies with the goal of driving higher productivity. 
So then turning to our Lennar other segment. For the third quarter, our Lennar other segment had operating earnings of $492 million. The driver of the earnings was LENx, which is our growing technology investment business. 3 of our LENx investments, Hippo, SmartRent and Blend went public, as Stuart mentioned during the quarter and we've recognized mark-to-market gains of $433 million on these investments. 
We also had mark-to-market gains of $61 million on our existing public investments, Opendoor and Sunnova. And as a side note, we do have an investment in Doma Holdings, which also went public in the third quarter, However, we do not utilize mark-to-market accounting for this investment, primarily because of our level of ownership. 
If we have marked the investment to market, the unrealized gain would have been $638 million. Again, this does not appear in our P&L or balance sheet just a noteworthy point. So you can see that LENx continues to, first and foremost, add value to our core homebuilding operations but also provides potential upside with investment earnings. 
Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash, and this is after deploying almost $600 million to retire debt early and buy back stock, which I'll discuss in a minute. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. 
We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and home generating significant homebuilding cash flow and improving returns. At quarter end, we owned 190,000 homesites and controlled 216,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.8 years in the prior year and our homesite controlled percentage increasing to 53% from 35% in the prior year. 
All this progress resulted in achieving a 23% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing oil returns. During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 2.5 million shares totaling $246 million. 
This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 4 million shares totaling $388 million. We also retired early our $300 million 6.25 senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our debt balance and saving about $9 million in interest as we utilize the 6-month par call future. 
Our next maturity, [indiscernible] million due in January 2022 as a 3-month par call, which we will also utilize to prepay the notes next month. This will leave us with no senior note maturities until October 2022. Additionally, during the quarter, we also paid off $50 million of other nonpublic homebuilding debt. So when you pull all this together at quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 21.2%, down from 29.5% in the prior year. 
And then a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $21 billion from $17 billion in the prior year, and our book value per share increased to 66.73 from 54.91 in the prior year. Our return on equity was 22% compared to 14% a year ago. 
And finally, in June, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P and are now investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. We are extremely proud of the status with the agencies and believe it reflects the successful execution of our operating strategy as well as our very strong balance sheet. 
And so with that brief overview, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 15,200 to 15,400 homes as we return to more seasonal patterns. And we expect our deliveries, as we've said, to be about 18,000. Now this estimate has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges bring a great deal of uncertainty.  The final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes to the same issues, which, of course, we are navigating each and every day. 
Our Q4 average sales price should be about 445,000 as we continue to see price appreciation. We expect our gross margin to be about 28% and we expect our SG&A to be about 6.7%. However, once again, these amounts will move up or down a bit depending on the number of homes delivered. 
And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q4 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Then turning to our other business segments, we believe our financial services earnings for Q4 will be in the range of $95 million to $105 million as market competition for purchased business continues. 
We expect our multifamily operations to be about breakeven. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect earnings in the range of $5 million to $10 million. This guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our mark-to-market investments since this will be determined by their stock price at the end of our quarter. 
We expect Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.2% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.8% and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 306 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $4.12 to $4.16 per share for the fourth quarter. 
And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned to have a strong end to our fiscal 2021. 
And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions."

I want to talk about the homebuilding business specifically. Stuart, 3 months ago,  we talked about how -- it might be more accurate to describe the move in home prices that the industry and you have seen over the past year as a correction upward, since home prices rose in order to reduce demand down to the depressed level of supply, there was a gap between supply and demand. 
And so this quarter, you've talked about, in your opening remarks, demand as being at a more normal seasonal level. But it's also fair to say that supply constraints have worsened too. So basically, at this point, what I'm asking is, would you say that demand is still above supply and then home prices are still generally rising. And more specifically, maybe how did demand respond to pricing actions you took over the summer? And how would you say things are trending thus far in September?"

I would clearly say that demand is above supply. And therein, you see pricing power. But at the same time, the kind of conflict that you're daylighting is that if you think about the sales pattern of last year, it stalled in and around COVID and then picked up very sharply as you went into the third and fourth quarters. And so your comparisons are relative to a kind of catch-up that was embedded in sales numbers back at that time. 
So yes, you still have very strong demand. You have very strong sales. You're not catching up anymore. And because you have short supply and a delivery system or a production system that is slowed by the supply chain, that demand is clearly outstripping supply, you still see pricing power. But comparisons are kind of tepid in terms of seeing sales growth because nobody wants to get way out ahead of what they can actually produce. 
When you ask about pricing over the past -- over the summertime, and how has that moderated sales, and that's exactly what you're seeing in our numbers is pricing power, pricing pulling back on sales a little bit and keeping our sales in check with the actual production abilities that are out there. Is that helpful?"

Then of course, at some point, the market is going to start focusing more on 2022 and beyond. And so I wanted to -- my next question sort of gets to that. Jon, you gave some good numbers, I think you said $5.40 per square foot in terms of cost, with lumber being 95% of that increase. And you've laid out an expectation that by 2Q of next year, the decline in lumber cost will be greater than other inflationary forces that you see in your cost structure, which I assume is a fancy way of saying that margins -- gross margins could trend upwards. I wanted to make sure that I didn't oversimplify and that, that is actually what you were trying to convey. 
And then as a follow-on to that, I would ask generally maybe for Stuart, the outlook for gross margins is one of the major areas of disagreement in -- for the street for next year. And I was curious, my view is that a return to sort of normal season outlook, what you talked about in no way suggests that margins are going to quickly return back to some sort of historical norm in part because home prices have already reached a new level and land costs are embedded in your balance sheet already at a lower cost. 
I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about how margins may trend over the next few years if supply and demand starts to come more into balance, are we going to see margins quickly return? Or would we likely see some hang time here on the gross margins?"

But I think that we're going to see how the supply chain actually evens itself out, what cycle times actually become as you go through a year like next year. And there's going to be an early year ripple from the supply chain disruption or complexity that exists right now. 
So we're not really giving guidance for next year.

It's just a lot of small initiatives across our business all the way from the internal plumbing system of our IT group and the way that we're compiling numbers and putting -- getting to quarter end literally within days, closing our books within days after the close of quarter and bring our numbers and projections to light digitally and automatically as opposed to with an awful lot of work from our people in the field. 
The efficiencies that we're injecting in every part of our business all the way from marketing to realtor commissions, to the way that our construction operations are actually run.

Thank you for joining. This morning, I'm here in Miami, joined by Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. 
We also have joining us Rick Beckwitt, who's in Colorado; and Jon Jaffe, who is actually here in Miami, but not in the office. 
As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about market strength around the country, land and community count as well. John will give an update on the supply chain, production and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give detailed financial highlights and additional guidance. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to 1 question and 1 follow-up. 
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that our fourth quarter and full year 2021 reflect extraordinary focus and determination by Lennar's management and operating teams across the country. While the housing market remains very strong in all of our major markets, the ability to actually execute and deliver results has been challenged and tested by the supply chain that is all but broken the workforce that is short in numbers, while driven to produce more and the never-ending competition for scarce entitled land assets. 
Lennar's managers and operators have been absolute warriors recognizing that our customers need and want their homes and the burden of a strong but stressed market simply can't stand in the way. The proud associates of Lennar are pleased to report an excellent quarter and year of accomplishments in spite of the elusive garage doors and short supply the unimaginable scarcity of paint, the cabinet deliveries postponed by labor shortage, the electric meters, the windows and the countless other their stumbling blocks and obstacles that have presented intermittently to ensure chaos in a production cycle that is difficult even everything is going right. The supply chain affects both land and construction and that will continue into the first quarter of 2022 and beyond. 
But as we enter the second half of the year, we expect that the supply chain disruption will be stabilized and mitigated by the greater number of starts that we have started, by the lessons learned and incorporated in our Builder of Choice relationships, and by the simplicity embedded in our Everything's Included offerings. 
And let me say that Kent Gilles and his extraordinary purchasing team have done an amazing job of navigating this difficult landscape. I also want to warmly acknowledge Jon and Rick, our co-CEOs, who have chosen not to sit on high perch in difficult times but instead went to the problem and soft for themselves so they could be part of the solution. 
Together, as partners, they visited each of our 38 divisions over a 6-week period met with our production and purchasing teams in the field got a tangible feel for the most significant issues and translated their visits into solutions, time, focus and attention problems are being solved, and that is simply the Lennar way. 
Even with the challenges in the market, in our fourth quarter, we delivered just under 18,000 homes which is every single home that could be delivered as our customers expected in one of their home for the holidays. 
We grew our deliveries 11% year-over-year, while our revenue from home sales grew 24% to almost $8.5 billion. And by remaining laser-focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 300 basis point gross margin improvement to 28%. 
Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 6%. We continue to limit our land -- excuse me, we continue to limit our sales pace especially as cycle times expand in favor of a significantly benefited bottom line. 
Accordingly, our net new orders grew 2%, and they're expected to contract slightly in first quarter. With our sales discipline, our net margin increased 460 basis points to a company all-time high of over 22% in our fourth quarter. 
This drove a 50% after-tax, and before mark-to-market items, bottom line improvement in net earnings to over $1.3 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom line over top line improvement, 24% revenue growth drove 50% bottom line growth. 
Additionally, our Financial Services group continued to perform exceptionally, adding $111 million of earnings while supporting the closing of every possible home, and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment. 
With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continued to improve as well. Even after the repurchase of 10 million shares of stock, and the reduction of $850 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.7 billion and an 18.3% debt-to-total cap ratio, while our return on equity grew almost 800 basis points year-over-year to 22.6%. 
All in all, our core operating numbers are very strong in the fourth quarter and we expect that strength to continue into 2022 and beyond. From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong across the country. Demand has been consistently strong, while the supply of new and existing homes remains limited. 
Since new home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the demand, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come. Even though home prices have moved much higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still very attractive and personal savings for deposits are strong. 
Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments and those higher wages are starting to be reflected in government numbers and unfortunately, in inflation as well. The upward spiral of housing purchases is accelerating. Millennials are forming families, apartment dwellers are purchasing first-time homes, first-time homes are selling at higher prices and appreciated equity is enabling first-time move-ups. 
The move-up home is selling at strong pricing with increased equity, enabling customers to purchase an even larger home, all this while supply is limited for everyone and the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace. 
Against this backdrop, and although there has been some turbulence through the year, 2021 has been an extraordinary strategic year for our company. We established a strategic plan that included cash flow generation and debt reduction in order to improve returns on capital and equity. We also articulated a drive and desire to have a strong focus on new technology-driven efficiencies and in our core business while we spin ancillary businesses and become a pure-play homebuilding company. 
Our 2021 performance reflects focus on these strategies and 2022 will be an extension of the same focus. In 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow to enable a reduction of debt by $1.3 billion and a purchase of [ 15 million ] shares of stock for a 4.5% reduction in share count. 
Accordingly, our debt to total cap is below 20%, and we have $2.7 billion of cash on hand. Our total debt is $4.7 billion and will continue to be reduced. We also reduced our landholdings to 3 years as promised and increased our land controlled versus owned to 59%, exceeding our goal at the beginning of the year. 
We have almost certainly established Lennar as a technology-enabled and engaged company. We invested in numerous new technologies while 8 prior investments were either sold or went public, which resulted in significant extraordinary profit for the company this year. 
Perhaps more importantly, we have invested in companies that enabled improvement in our core business while we have benefited both through the investment and through incorporation in our core. 
But this is just the beginning. We are working with numerous additional technology companies that are working to solve some of the most difficult problems facing our industry. As a case in point, we're working to solve the issues in supply chain, labor shortages and production using innovative technology in innovative ways. 
Many of you have read and commented on our investment in ICON, the 3D printing building company in Austin, Texas. We expect to start our first 3D printed community in Austin sometime in 2022 and hope to reduce labor, material and time as we help refine this structural production process. Alongside ICON, we have invested in 2 additional innovative production companies called Vive and Cover, and they're engaged in innovative factory-based manufactured solutions to production. Both Vive and Cover are focused on a more comprehensive solution beyond just the structural components and encompass mechanical, electrical and plumbing solutions in the factory as well. 
These companies are working on each of the major components of the home and building better and more precise delivery systems that will reduce the need for labor and enhance precision and cycle time. All of these companies are focused on the most frictional and problematic elements of the production process and driving towards solutions for the industry. 
Given today's supply chain and workforce constraints, we should all be interested, if not laser focused on the success of these critical solutions. Lennar most certainly is. And finally, 2021 has, in fact, been a year of focus on the strategy of becoming a pure-play homebuilding company. We have been hard at work refining our SpinCo that I've described in the past. 
As you can see from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo has become more compelling with each quarter's successes. We have excess capacity and balance sheet to spin our well-established ancillary businesses, and we expect to complete a tax-free spin by the second or third quarter of 2022. 
To that end, in November, we took our first significant in-depth to complete the spin by formally filing a request for a private letter ruling from the IRS. We are getting very close to being prepared with defined business lines, a refined business plan and a balance sheet. We expect to file our at-first confidential Form 10 by the end of January or beginning of February, at which time we expect to have a name other than SpinCo and a management team in place. 
Someone had asked about the time we have taken to disclose greater detail. The fact is we're building a durable and sustainable public company that has to hit the ground running on day 1. To that end, Matt Zames as senior adviser to the company has been focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. In addition to and supporting that, Jeff McCall, and a sequestered team of senior internal leaders, have modeled various configurations with different asset composition that have focused on getting both the program and the story right for the public markets. 
We have concluded that the Spin Company will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. Many of the assets that we targeted for spin originally will be either part of the limited balance sheet of SpinCo or will be monetized in the form of assets under management housed within the private equity verticals in or have been or will be resolved or monetized in other ways. 
The monetization has been and will be completed over the next year or so, and the cash proceeds will be deployed in Lennar to fortify our balance sheet or to continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis. And Lennar -- and when our stock is on sale, like today, we'll be purchasing. Three core verticals have been identified and business planned for the spin, and they are multifamily, single-family for rent and land strategies. 
Each of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and our active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management and is raising its third fund. 
LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.5 billion of equity already raised. And our land strategies platform is still being refined for SpinCo and will provide more detail in the near future. The remaining Lennar Corporation will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and the spin will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share as we project them. 
Bottom line, this was a year of hard work at Lennar in the face of many issues, and there were no feet up on the desk during the year. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. 
The market in general remains strong. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar and the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited. 
We remain focused on an orderly targeted growth strategy with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, and therefore, driving our net margin. As we look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for Lennar. 
As we noted in our press release, we're projecting 12,500 deliveries at a 26.75% margin in the first quarter and 67,000 deliveries at a 27% to 27.5% margin for the year. At this pace, we will have a strong bottom line with a projected spin-off in the second or third quarter, 2022 will be another record year for Lennar. And with that, let me turn it over to Rick."

As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a fine-tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. 
We have continued to strategically sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize sales prices and to offset potential cost increases. To that end, we have slowed sales to generate higher profits. Our fourth quarter results prove out the success of this strategy as we achieved gross margin increases of 300 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. 
During the fourth quarter, we started 4.5 homes per community, sold 4.3 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 160 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin, and lead to increased deliveries and profits in fiscal 2022. 
In the fourth quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were solid in each of our operating regions. We continue to achieve price increases and saw strength in all product comp categories from entry level to move up, and in our active adult communities. 
Here's some color on some of the stronger markets across the country. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited. 
The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami and Dade and Broward in the Southeast, and Tampa. Orlando has also been sustaining a strong recovery with a significant rebound in tourism. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best brand position. 
In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets. Inventory is very limited and the combination of core local demand and in-migration continues to push both sales pace and price. We are also the top builder in each of these markets. 
Indianapolis continues to see strong and steady growth, the combination of in-migration from the northern markets in the West Coast as well as affordable housing and quality of living is driving sales pace and pricing. We're the largest builder in this market. 
Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country within migration from East and West. The state's pro-business employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth. especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from a recovery in the oil and gas sector. 
The strongest market in the country continues to be Austin, with recent announcements by Samsung Electronics to invest $17 billion in a new chip manufacturing plan and Tesla's announcement to relocate their corporate head of quarters to Austin, in addition to finishing construction this month on a 1.1 billion giga factory. 
Two companies alone will create thousands of new jobs in Austin. The Colorado market picked up momentum in the fourth quarter. and we saw strength in both sales pace and price with over 1 sale per community matching our start space. Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets both benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in migration from California. 
The casinos in Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving because it's incredibly affordable. We entered the Boise market with 2 communities during the quarter and anticipate having 8 active communities by the end of 2022. 
This market continues to have strength driven by tremendous population growth, and we're excited about our position and our Lennar Boise team. The Pacific Northwest continues to be a strong market as natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries limit production. 
In spite of being land constrained, we are seeing solid year-over-year growth in these markets as we expand our geographic footprint. The California markets remained strong, driven by the state's severe housing shortage there is more demand than supply. As reported last quarter, the Inland Empire, Sacramento and East Bay Area have remained at some of the strongest markets with homebuyers looking for square footage and affordability. 
During the quarter, we saw a resurgence in the core markets of the Bay Area as more employees are returning to their offices or anticipate returning in the near future. As such, both core and inland markets are firing on all cylinders. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but there is strength and depth of market across the country. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. During the fourth quarter, our community count increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially as we continue to focus on growth in our existing and new markets. We expect our Q1 community count to be about 5% lower than year-end 2021. 
However, our community count will start to increase in the second quarter and we should end 2022 with a low double-digit increase in community count year-over-year. While supply chain issues and inspection delays are impacting the timing of some community openings, we are in an excellent position for strong growth in 2022. 
Our land pipeline remains robust with plenty of land in the queue to meet our goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years. as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned and controlled. 
We are also pleased with the excellent progress we made on our land-light strategy as evidenced by our years owned supply of homesites improving to our previously stated goal of 3 years at the end of the fourth quarter from 3.5 years last year, and our controlled home site percentage increasing to 59% from 39% for the same period. 
Equally important, these improvements were achieved while growing our overall owned and controlled land position by 44% year-over-year, with all of that increase in controlled home sites. 
Given the progress we've made, our new goal for 2022 is to end the year with 2.75 years of owned homesites and with a 65% control position. Our extreme focus on a land-lighter model generated significant cash flow during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter, as Stuart said, with $2.7 billion of cash, no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolver. And this was after repurchasing just under $1 billion of our common stock and paying off $850 million in debt. I'd like to thank our team of great associates across the country for their focus and solid execution to make all this happen. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon."

I will now give an update on how we managed through the impact of supply chain disruptions in the fourth quarter and how we have planned for managing through them in 2022. As Stuart noted, we have had to deal with our fair share of disruptions. Similar to the third quarter, these disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They are intermittent, and they continue. 
It continues to be a game of whack a mole that creates stress and uncertainty for an already strained labor base as materials often do not show up when expected. In the fourth quarter, the supply categories that were most impacted on a national basis or garage doors, windows, paint, HVAC condensers and flex duct and cabinets. 
Regionally, there were a variety of disruptions in the delivery of materials and/or the availability of labor. On average, this increased our fourth quarter cycle time by an additional 2 weeks from the third quarter, bringing the year-over-year increase to a range of 4 to 6 weeks. 
Despite these disruptions and the associated increase in cycle time, the team at Lennar still managed to deliver approximately 18,000 homes in the quarter as expected. This was in large part due to a record number of starts in our second quarter of 19,500 homes to ensure we had enough inventory to meet our delivery goals. Additionally, the extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams at Lennar have never been better coordinated and are managing their scheduling on a day-by-day basis in partnership with each of our trade partners. 
We continue to work with our partners to solve issues in real time as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. Examples of the strength of our strategic trade partnerships is when we had to take business away from our primary garage door manufacturer. They constructively work with us to move the business over to another vendor. 
When our major cabinet manufacturer fell behind due to labor and material shortages, they opened their factory for us on a weekend to manufacture 350 homes worth of cabinets in order to catch up. These are just 2 out of many examples where we and our valued trade partners found solutions to the challenges of the current environment. 
Our decade-long platform, everything is included, continues to be a strategic advantage in lessening the impact of the supply chain shortages. It's a simple program with fewer SKUs to manage, allowing us to plan ahead and order our material needs far in advance. 
As discussed in prior quarters, we are in our sixth year of focusing on being the Builder of Choice for our trade partners. This program has successfully created close-knit relationships with our strategic building partners, allowing both parties to be nimble in adjusting to these disruptions. 
We believe our strategic relationships have allowed us, together with our partners, to learn lessons from 2021 so we can be better prepared for 2022. We have been meeting with our key partners, along with additional new partners to allocate projected 2022 volume as opposed to just prioritizing available volume. 
This way, we identified potential gaps in availability upfront, allowing for proactive versus reactive solutions. We have completed about half the categories will complete the remaining ones in the next few weeks. 
We have added manufacturing and trade partners in key categories to ensure availability along with a continuous process of simplification to ongoing SKU reductions. Lastly, we have secured alternative distribution solutions to provide safety stock of certain commodities and short supply materials. 
We believe the combination of all these efforts will allow for the stabilization of the supply chain for Lennar in the back half of this year. Turning to the construction cost impacts on our fourth quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year that are now impact cost as homes close. 
In the fourth quarter, costs were up $6.78 per square foot over the third quarter and lumber accounted for $4.18 of that increase. We will still see increased costs from lumber in our first quarter deliveries. But starting in Q2 and through Q3, we will benefit from lumber cost reductions. 
We experienced cost pressures in Q4 in other material categories and on labor that will start to flow through closings in the second half of 2022. On a final note, as Stuart mentioned, Rick and I recently spent 6 weeks on the road visiting communities and construction sites in each and every one of our markets. 
While we knew what to expect in terms of the supply disruptions and labor shortages that we would see, it was important for us to experience this firsthand, so we can most effectively manage through this environment. Importantly, this gave us the opportunity to meet with our teams and trade partners in the field, listen to their ideas, and shake their hands to thank them for their incredible dedication and effort they give in delivering quality homes to our customers. 
We can assure you that Lennar culture is alive and well and as strong as ever. We'd like to take this opportunity to again thank all of our Lennar associates and trade partners for the incredible quarter that they delivered. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Diane."
30763,1760394055,2462397,"Lennar Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon has provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet,",1437,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon has provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet, and then provide detailed guidance for Q1 2022 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2022. 
So starting with Financial Services. In the fourth quarter, our financial services team produced $111 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $77 million compared to $125 million in the prior year. 
As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refinance volumes have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. 
This was the primary driver for our fourth quarter, lower secondary margins as compared to the prior year. Title operating earnings were $30 million compared to $28 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to growth in profit per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in volume driven by a reduction in refinance orders. 
Quarter after quarter, our Title team has been focused on automation and efficiencies with the goal of driving higher productivity. And then turning to Lennar Other. For the fourth quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $176 million. This loss was primarily the result of noncash mark-to-market losses on our strategic technology investments which totaled $180 million. 
As we have mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. While the technology investments had downside with losses for this quarter, overall for the fiscal year, our investments provided approximately $500 million of unrealized gains. 
In addition, and most important, our investments continue to add value to our core homebuilding operations. And then turning to our balance sheet. For the quarter and the year, focused on becoming land lighter. As a result, at quarter end, we owned 182,000 homesites and controlled 257,000 homesites for a total of 439,000 home sites. 
Our year supply owned decreased to 3 years from 3.5 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increased to 59% from 39% in the prior year. We were also laser-focused on generating cash flow, reducing debt and increasing returns, as you've heard. Therefore, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.5 billion evolving credit facility. 
We also retired $850 million of senior notes that were due in 2022. Together with $300 million of senior notes paid in the third quarter, we retired a total of $1.15 billion of senior notes in 2021. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which is due in November 2022, and we have no maturities due in fiscal '23. 
Also during the quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares totaling $977 million, bringing the total repurchase for the full year to 14 million shares, totaling almost $1.4 billion or 4.5% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $76 million which brings total cash return to shareholders for dividends for the year to $310 million. 
The result of all these transactions was a homebuilding debt to total capital of 18.3%, which was down from 24.9% in the prior year. As you can see, our primary focus was cash generation and capital allocation during 2021, but it's the continuation of our multiyear strategy. 
During fiscal 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. However, over the past 3 years, 2019 through 2021, we generated about $8 billion of homebuilding cash flow and allocated approximately $5 billion of debt reduction as our first priority, approximately $2 billion to share buybacks and approximately $600 million was returned to shareholders through dividend payments. 
And this focus will, of course, continue in 2022. And just a final few points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $21 billion. Our book value per share increased to [ 69 52 ]. Our return on inventory was 27%, excluding consolidated inventory not owned. And our return on equity was 22.6%. 
So with that brief overview, I'd like to provide some detailed guidance for the first quarter and then high-level guidance for fiscal 2022, starting with the first quarter. 
We expect our Q1 new orders to be in the range of 14,800 to 15,100 homes. As you heard us say, as we continue to moderate sales pace to match production cycle changes. This is consistent with the approach we have taken for quite a while. 
We expect our Q1 inventory -- I'm sorry, our Q1 ending community count to be about 5% lower than the end of year 2021. However, community count will then increase in the second quarter, and we should end 2022 with low double-digit year-over-year growth. 
We believe our Q1 deliveries will be around 12,500. But similar to last quarter, the assessment has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges continue to bring a great deal of uncertainty. 
So the final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes to the supply chain challenges which, of course, we are navigating each and every day. Our Q1 average sales price should be about $460,000, and we expect our gross margin to be around 26.75% which reflects the impact of peak lumber prices from last year and less field expense leverage. 
We expect our SG&A to be between 7.8% and 7.9% as we continue to continue to focus on simplification and efficiencies. Now I will note again that gross margin and SG&A estimates will move up or down a bit depending on the number of homes delivered. And for the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of approximately $5 million. 
Looking at our other business segments and other additional items. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $85 million to $90 million as market competition for purchased business continues. We expect a loss of about $10 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect to be about breakeven. 
But remember, this guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments, this will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2% of total revenue. 
Our charitable foundation will be based on $1,000 per home, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. And the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 297 million shares. 
And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.54 to $2.57 per share for the first quarter. And then turning to the full year 2022. We expect to deliver approximately 67,000 homes with an average sales price of about $460,000. 
This would result in about $31 billion of homebuilding revenue, which should be an increase of approximately 20% from fiscal 2021. We expect our full year gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%. And with our continued focus on technology and efficiencies, we expect our fiscal year SG&A to decrease to the range of 6.8% to 6.9%. 
We believe our financial services earnings will be in the range of [indiscernible] million to $450 million as market competition continues. And finally, our tax rate should be approximately 25%. And so as we continue to execute on our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned to have a strong fiscal year 2022. 
Before I turn it over to the operator, let me take a moment to thank our finance teams, accounting, planning and all others involved. Our earnings release went out yesterday, 15 days after year-end, and we are hosting our earnings call today, 16 days after year-end. 
We've been holding our quarterly calls within this general time frame for over a year. Although the time frames have been consistent, make no mistake, the war continued. Our goal is to not be satisfied with what has been accomplished, but rather to make incremental progress through automation and efficiencies each and every quarter while we compile and report our actual or forecasted results. 
The incremental progress is the result of a lot of hard work. So congratulations teams and a sincere thank you for what you've accomplished this year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Let me -- before answering the question, I just want to second Diane's congratulations to the finance team with David Collins sitting here. A lot of hard work goes into getting the year and quarter close, and they're doing a great job. But let me answer that, Susan. The reality that we're seeing in the field, as we have come to our year-end and even as we go into December is the market remains strong traditional seasonality is coming back, but still relative to that seasonality, we're seeing basic strength in the marketplace. 
The constraining factor right now is the production cycle. And we have been decidedly focused on matching our sales pace with that production cycle, recognizing that we're going to maximize execution in bottom line by keeping those 2 pieces in parity. So as we think about the upcoming selling season, it is feeling to us -- as we look at the market, as we look at week-by-week sales, traffic, demand, it is feeling to us that this is going to be a very, very strong selling season. 
It is going to be more of a traditional selling season in that as we get to the end of February, March, we expect to see even more of a pickup. But make no mistake, it's strong out there right now. With that said, the production cycle, as I've noted, the cycle times have been extending through the quarters. We're cognizant of that. 
We recognize that it's a bit of, as Jon said, whack a mole out there. One day, it's garage doors, another day, it's windows or paint. And that kind of configuration is at least in our world, starting to feel like we're stabilizing it. I noted our purchasing team and the work that they have done around our Builder of Choice programs or everything's included programs, working to really stabilize that purchasing side and logistics side of our business. 
And as we go forward, I think you're going to see that parity, that pairing of production cycles stabilizing and high demand in the marketplace start to move things towards what I think is going to be more of an upside in 2022. And we'll just have to wait and see if it plays out that way. 
We've clearly conservatized some of our numbers to recognize the landscape that exists today, and we'll see how the market plays out as we go forward."

Your first question relative to the SpinCo, we have been -- look, you have to -- as we configured SpinCo, we've gone back and forth on an asset-heavier, asset-lighter approach. 
We think that in terms of defining the company going forward, our best program going forward is an asset-light approach to SpinCo. That means that many of the assets that we targeted at the outset will end up either an AUM or we will liquidate an orderly course on the Lennar book. 
It's still the same basic configuration of asset base. We've just been -- it's all been about turning assets into cash and deploying the cash or deploying the assets so that we lighten up our inventory and we end up with a spun ancillary business program that enables that pure-play focus on homebuilding and financial services.

And I'd just say that, Mike, relative to looking ahead, it's always difficult to look out numerous quarters, particularly in the market where labor and materials and logistics are moving around I think that we feel pretty optimistic about our margins as we go forward.

So that's pretty consistent with previous years.

So clearly, there's been a huge push for tying up more land. And on one hand, it's all tied up through option contracts, which is great because it's obviously capital efficient. But on the other hand, it doesn't seem like the market is going to be capable of delivering that type of growth anytime soon. 
So effectively, the way I look at it, the tail of your land supply is effectively continuing to grow unless we could just see huge bottlenecks resolved here over the next year or 2. And while it's off balance sheet, you still do have $1 billion more of capital tied up in option deposits today than you had 5 or 6 quarters ago. So it's not completely asset-free or capital free. So I'm just curious, should we expect that growth to maybe start slowing here? 
Or are you comfortable effectively growing that tail because you want to have your kind of arms around all corners of the market for when the market does resolve itself from these constraints?"

And if you -- what we basically daylighted is that its self-imposed stabilization, meaning we've increased the number of starts in order to be able to accommodate the fact that the cycle time has expanded, deliveries are somewhat impaired. 
I think the supply chain disruptions, I can't predict what's going to actually happen in the field. But we've done, and we've put buffers out there and increased starts. Our Builder of Choice program working with our subcontractor base, our building partner base, to activate kind of safeguards and programming to enable a better delivery system and logistics system. 
And, additionally, our Everything's Included program, really reducing the number of SKUs in our product offering is working to our benefit and helps with our Builder of Choice program to really create embedded buffers that I think are going to really position us well in the second half of the year. So your question is what kind of conservatism have we injected I think that we're kind of expecting more of a steady state program through the year. 
We're certainly not getting over our skis and expecting that everything will stabilize and right level of perfection as we get to the second half, I can't give you a number in that regard. But conceptually, we've taken a conservative approach to looking to the remainder of the year. But we think that the market is going to stabilize at least on the supply chain side."

Yes, lumber is moderating, and we're going to bypass the first quarter's peak. But at the same time, you have pressures from labor and materials in other areas that are clearly offsets to the benefit that we'll get from the lumber reduction. 
So the cost side of the equation is moving around. We'll still have to see where ASP goes and you're correct that when we start to normalize our field expense, and lumber starts coming down, there's somewhat of a gap in some of our numbers, but we're going to have to see how that gap is filled by the other traditional areas where costs are going up. Don't underestimate what's happening in labor. 
In a constrained labor market, you got to pay more. And sometimes you get things done, you got to pay a lot more. Same thing on logistics. So that's what's happening in the field right now. You can't predict it. All we can do is lay out our expectations, and that's what we've done.

Thank you for joining. This morning, I'm here in Miami, joined by Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from.
We also have joining us Rick Beckwitt, who's in Colorado; and Jon Jaffe, who is actually here in Miami, but not in the office.
As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about market strength around the country, land and community count as well. Jon will give an update on the supply chain, production and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give detailed financial highlights and additional guidance. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to 1 question and 1 follow-up.
So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that our fourth quarter and full year 2021 reflect extraordinary focus and determination by Lennar's management and operating teams across the country While the housing market remains very strong in all of our major markets, the ability to actually execute and deliver results has been challenged and tested by the supply chain that is all but broken the workforce that is short in numbers, while driven to produce more and the never-ending competition for scarce entitled land assets.
Lennar's managers and operators have been absolute warriors recognizing that our customers need and want their homes and the burden of a strong but stressed market simply can't stand in the way. The proud associates of Lennar are pleased to report an excellent quarter and year of accomplishments in spite of the elusive garage doors and short supply, the unimaginable scarcity of paint, the cabinet deliveries postponed by labor shortage, the electric meters, the windows and the countless other their stumbling blocks and obstacles that have presented intermittently to ensure chaos in a production cycle that is difficult even everything is going right. The supply chain affects both land and construction and that will continue into the first quarter of 2022 and beyond.
But as we enter the second half of the year, we expect that the supply chain disruption will be stabilized and mitigated by the greater number of starts that we have started, by the lessons learned and incorporated in our Builder of Choice relationships, and by the simplicity embedded in our Everything's Included offerings.
And let me say that Kemp Gillis and his extraordinary purchasing team have done an amazing job of navigating this difficult landscape. I also want to warmly acknowledge Jon and Rick, our co-CEOs, who have chosen not to sit on high perch in difficult times but instead went to the problem and sort for themselves so they could be part of the solution.
Together, as partners, they visited each of our 38 divisions over a 6-week period met with our production and purchasing teams in the field, got a tangible feel for the most significant issues and translated their visits into solutions. Time, focus and attention, problems are being solved, and that is simply the Lennar way.
Even with the challenges in the market, in our fourth quarter, we delivered just under 18,000 homes which is every single home that could be delivered as our customers expected in one of their home for the holidays.
We grew our deliveries 11% year-over-year, while our revenue from home sales grew 24% to almost $8.5 billion. And by remaining laser-focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 300 basis point gross margin improvement to 28%.  Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 6%. We continue to limit our land -- excuse me, we continue to limit our sales pace especially as cycle times expand in favor of a significantly benefited bottom line.
Accordingly, our net new orders grew 2%, and they're expected to contract slightly in first quarter. With our sales discipline, our net margin increased 460 basis points to a company all-time high of over 22% in our fourth quarter.
This drove a 50% after-tax, and before mark-to-market items, bottom line improvement in net earnings to over $1.3 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom line over top line improvement, 24% revenue growth drove 50% bottom line growth.
Additionally, our Financial Services group continued to perform exceptionally, adding $111 million of earnings while supporting the closing of every possible home, and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment.
With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continued to improve as well. Even after the repurchase of 10 million shares of stock, and the reduction of $850 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.7 billion and an 18.3% debt-to-total cap ratio, while our return on equity grew almost 800 basis points year-over-year to 22.6%.  
All in all, our core operating numbers are very strong in the fourth quarter and we expect that strength to continue into 2022 and beyond. From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong across the country. Demand has been consistently strong, while the supply of new and existing homes remains limited.
Since new home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the demand, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come. Even though home prices have moved much higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still very attractive and personal savings for deposits are strong.
Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments and those higher wages are starting to be reflected in government numbers and unfortunately, in inflation as well. The upward spiral of housing purchases is accelerating. Millennials are forming families, apartment dwellers are purchasing first-time homes, first-time homes are selling at higher prices and appreciated equity is enabling first-time move-ups.  
The move-up home is selling at strong pricing with increased equity, enabling customers to purchase an even larger home, all this while supply is limited for everyone and the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace.
Against this backdrop, and although there has been some turbulence through the year, 2021 has been an extraordinary strategic year for our company. We established a strategic plan that included cash flow generation and debt reduction in order to improve returns on capital and equity. We also articulated a drive and desire to have a strong focus on new technology-driven efficiencies and in our core business while we spin ancillary businesses and become a pure-play homebuilding company.
Our 2021 performance reflects focus on these strategies and 2022 will be an extension of the same focus. In 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow to enable a reduction of debt by $1.3 billion and a purchase of 14 million shares of stock for a 4.5% reduction in share count.  
Accordingly, our debt to total cap is below 20%, and we have $2.7 billion of cash on hand. Our total debt is [ $4.7 ] billion and will continue to be reduced. We also reduced our landholdings to 3 years as promised and increased our land controlled versus owned to 59%, exceeding our goal at the beginning of the year.  
We have almost certainly established Lennar as a technology-enabled and engaged company. We invested in numerous new technologies while 8 prior investments were either sold or went public, which resulted in significant extraordinary profit for the company this year. Perhaps more importantly, we have invested in companies that have enabled improvement in our core business while we have benefited both through the investment and through incorporation in our core.
But this is just the beginning. We are working with numerous additional technology companies that are working to solve some of the most difficult problems facing our industry. As a case in point, we're working to solve the issues in supply chain, labor shortages and production using innovative technology in innovative ways.
Many of you have read and commented on our investment in ICON, the 3D printing building company in Austin, Texas. We expect to start our first 3D-printed community in Austin sometime in 2022 and hope to reduce labor, material and time as we help refine this structural production process. Alongside ICON, we have invested in 2 additional innovative production companies called Veev and Cover, and they're engaged in innovative factory-based manufactured solutions to production. Both Veev and Cover are focused on a more comprehensive solution beyond just the structural components and encompass mechanical, electrical and plumbing solutions in the factory as well.
These companies are working on each of the major components of the home and building better and more precise delivery systems that will reduce the need for labor and enhance precision and cycle time. All of these companies are focused on the most frictional and problematic elements of the production process and driving towards solutions for the industry.
Given today's supply chain and workforce constraints, we should all be interested, if not laser focused on the success of these critical solutions, Lennar most certainly is. And finally, 2021 has, in fact, been a year of focus on the strategy of becoming a pure-play homebuilding company. We have been hard at work refining our SpinCo that I've described in the past.
As you can see from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo has become more compelling with each quarter's successes. We have excess capacity and balance sheet to spin our well-established ancillary businesses, and we expect to complete a tax-free spin by the second or third quarter of 2022.
To that end, in November, we took our first significant in-depth to complete the spin by formally filing a request for a private letter ruling from the IRS. We are getting very close to being prepared with defined business lines, a refined business plan and a balance sheet. We expect to file our at-first confidential Form 10 by the end of January or beginning of February, at which time we expect to have a name other than SpinCo and a management team in place.
Someone had asked about the time we have taken to disclose greater detail. The fact is we're building a durable and sustainable public company that has to hit the ground running on day 1. To that end, Matt Zames as senior adviser to the company has been focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. In addition to and supporting that, Jeff McCall, and a sequestered team of senior internal leaders, have modeled various configurations with different asset composition that have focused on getting both the program and the story right for the public markets.
We have concluded that the Spin Company will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. Many of the assets that we targeted for spin originally will be either part of the limited balance sheet of SpinCo or will be monetized in the form of assets under management housed within the private equity verticals in or have been or will be resolved or monetized in other ways.
The monetization has been and will be completed over the next year or so, and the cash proceeds will be deployed in Lennar to fortify our balance sheet or to continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis, and Lennar -- and when our stock is on sale, like today, we'll be purchasing. Three core verticals have been identified and business planned for the spin, and they are multifamily, single-family for rent and land strategies.
Each of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and our active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management and is raising its third fund.
LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.5 billion of equity already raised. And our land strategies platform is still being refined for SpinCo and will provide more detail in the near future. The remaining Lennar Corporation will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and the spin will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share as we project them.
Bottom line, this was a year of hard work at Lennar in the face of many issues, and there were no feet up on the desk during the year. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market.
The market in general remains strong. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar and the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited.
We remain focused on an orderly targeted growth strategy with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, and therefore, driving our net margin. 
As we look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for Lennar. As we noted in our press release, we're projecting 12,500 deliveries at a 26.75% margin in the first quarter and 67,000 deliveries at a 27% to 27.5% margin for the year. At this pace, we will have a strong bottom line with a projected spin-off in the second or third quarter, 2022 will be another record year for Lennar. And with that, let me turn it over to Rick."

As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a fine-tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis.
We have continued to strategically sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize sales prices and to offset potential cost increases. To that end, we have slowed sales to generate higher profits. Our fourth quarter results prove out the success of this strategy as we achieved gross margin increases of 300 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially.
During the fourth quarter, we started 4.5 homes per community, sold 4.3 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 160 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin, and lead to increased deliveries and profits in fiscal 2022.
In the fourth quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were solid in each of our operating regions. We continue to achieve price increases and saw strength in all product cost categories from entry level to move up, and in our active adult communities.
Here's some color on some of the stronger markets across the country. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast, the Midwest and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited.
The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami and Dade and Broward in the Southeast, and Tampa. Orlando has also been sustaining a strong recovery with a significant rebound in tourism. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best brand position.
In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets. Inventory is very limited and the combination of core local demand and in-migration continues to push both sales pace and price. We are also the top builder in each of these markets.
Indianapolis continues to see strong and steady growth, the combination of in-migration from the northern markets in the West Coast as well as affordable housing and quality of living is driving sales pace and pricing. We're the largest builder in this market.
Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country within migration from East and West. The state's pro-business employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from a recovery in the oil and gas sector.
The strongest market in the country continues to be Austin, with recent announcements by Samsung Electronics to invest $17 billion in a new chip manufacturing plant and Tesla's announcement to relocate their corporate headquarters to Austin. In addition to finishing construction this month on a 1.1 billion Gigafactory.
Two companies alone will create thousands of new jobs in Austin. The Colorado market picked up momentum in the fourth quarter. and we saw strength in both sales pace and price with over 1 sale per community matching our start space. Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets both benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in migration from California.
The casinos in Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving because it's incredibly affordable. We entered the Boise market with 2 communities during the quarter and anticipate having 8 active communities by the end of 2022. This market continues to have strength driven by tremendous population growth, and we're excited about our land position and our Lennar Boise team. 
The Pacific Northwest continues to be a strong market as natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries limit production. In spite of being land constrained, we are seeing solid year-over-year growth in these markets as we expand our geographic footprint.
The California markets remained strong, driven by the state's severe housing shortage there is more demand than supply. As reported last quarter, the Inland Empire, Sacramento and East Bay Area have remained at some of the strongest markets with homebuyers looking for square footage and affordability.
During the quarter, we saw a resurgence in the core markets of the Bay Area as more employees are returning to their offices or anticipate returning in the near future. As such, both core and Inland markets are firing on all cylinders. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but there is strength and depth of market across the country. 
Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. During the fourth quarter, our community count increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially as we continue to focus on growth in our existing and new markets. We expect our Q1 community count to be about 5% lower than year-end 2021.
However, our community count will start to increase in the second quarter and we should end 2022 with a low double-digit increase in community count year-over-year. While supply chain issues and inspection delays are impacting the timing of some community openings, we are in an excellent position for strong growth in 2022.
Our land pipeline remains robust with plenty of land in the queue to meet our goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned and controlled.
We are also pleased with the excellent progress we made on our land-light strategy as evidenced by our years owned supply of homesites improving to our previously stated goal of 3 years at the end of the fourth quarter from 3.5 years last year, and our controlled home site percentage increasing to 59% from 39% for the same period.
Equally important, these improvements were achieved while growing our overall owned and controlled land position by 44% year-over-year, with all of that increase in controlled home sites.
Given the progress, we've made, our new goal for 2022 is to end the year with 2.75 years of owned homesites and with a 65% control position. Our extreme focus on a land-lighter model generated significant cash flow during the quarter.
We ended the quarter, as Stuart said, with $2.7 billion of cash, no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolver.

I will now give an update on how we managed through the impact of supply chain disruptions in the fourth quarter and how we have planned for managing through them in 2022. As Stuart noted, we have had to deal with our fair share of disruptions. Similar to the third quarter, these disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They are intermittent, and they continue.
It continues to be a game of whack-a-mole that creates stress and uncertainty for an already strained labor base as materials often do not show up when expected. In the fourth quarter, the supply categories that were most impacted on a national basis or garage doors, windows, paint, HVAC condensers and flex duct and cabinets.
Regionally, there were a variety of disruptions in the delivery of materials and/or the availability of labor. On average, this increased our fourth quarter cycle time by an additional 2 weeks from the third quarter, bringing the year-over-year increase to a range of 4 to 6 weeks.
Despite these disruptions and the associated increase in cycle time, the team at Lennar still managed to deliver approximately 18,000 homes in the quarter as expected. This was in large part due to a record number of starts in our second quarter of 19,500 homes to ensure we had enough inventory to meet our delivery goals. 
Additionally, the extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams at Lennar have never been better coordinated and are managing their scheduling on a day-by-day basis in partnership with each of our trade partners.
We continue to work with our partners to solve issues in real time as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. Examples of the strength of our strategic trade partnerships is when we had to take business away from our primary garage door manufacturer. They constructively work with us to move the business over to another vendor.
When our major cabinet manufacturer fell behind due to labor and material shortages, they opened their factory for us on a weekend to manufacture 350 homes worth of cabinets in order to catch up. These are just 2 out of many examples where we and our valued trade partners found solutions to the challenges of the current environment. 
Our decade-long platform, Everything's Included, continues to be a strategic advantage in lessening the impact of the supply chain shortages. It's a simple program with fewer SKUs to manage, allowing us to plan ahead and order our material needs far in advance.
As discussed in prior quarters, we are in our sixth year of focusing on being the Builder of Choice for our trade partners. This program has successfully created close-knit relationships with our strategic building partners, allowing both parties to be nimble in adjusting to these disruptions. 
We believe our strategic relationships have allowed us, together with our partners, to learn lessons from 2021 so we can be better prepared for 2022. We have been meeting with our key partners, along with additional new partners to allocate projected 2022 volume as opposed to just prioritizing available volume.
This way, we identified potential gaps in availability upfront, allowing for proactive versus reactive solutions. We have completed about half the categories will complete the remaining ones in the next few weeks.
We have added manufacturing and trade partners in key categories to ensure availability along with a continuous process of simplification to ongoing SKU reductions. Lastly, we have secured alternative distribution solutions to provide safety stock of certain commodities and short supply materials. We believe the combination of all these efforts will allow for the stabilization of the supply chain for Lennar in the back half of this year.
Turning to the construction cost impacts on our fourth quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year that are now impact cost as homes close. 
In the fourth quarter, costs were up $6.78 per square foot over the third quarter and lumber accounted for $4.18 of that increase. We will still see increased costs from lumber in our first quarter deliveries. But starting in Q2 and through Q3, we will benefit from lumber cost reductions.
We experienced cost pressures in Q4 in other material categories and on labor that will start to flow through closings in the second half of 2022. On a final note, as Stuart mentioned, Rick and I recently spent 6 weeks on the road, visiting communities and construction sites in each and every one of our markets.
While we knew what to expect in terms of the supply disruptions and labor shortages that we would see, it was important for us to experience this firsthand, so we can most effectively manage through this environment. Importantly, this gave us the opportunity to meet with our teams and trade partners in the field, listen to their ideas, and shake their hands to thank them for their incredible dedication and effort they give in delivering quality homes to our customers.
We can assure you that Lennar culture is alive and well and as strong as ever. We'd like to take this opportunity to again thank all of our Lennar associates and trade partners for the incredible quarter that they delivered. 
Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Diane."
30763,1760394055,2462436,"Lennar Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon has provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet,",1437,"Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon has provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet, and then provide detailed guidance for Q1 2022 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2022.
So starting with Financial Services. In the fourth quarter, our Financial Services team produced $111 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $77 million compared to $125 million in the prior year. 
As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refinance volumes have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. 
This was the primary driver for our fourth quarter, lower secondary margins as compared to the prior year. Title operating earnings were $30 million compared to $28 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to growth in profit per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in volume driven by a reduction in refinance orders.
Quarter after quarter, our Title team has been focused on automation and efficiencies with the goal of driving higher productivity. And then turning to Lennar Other. For the fourth quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $176 million. This loss was primarily the result of noncash mark-to-market losses on our strategic technology investments which totaled $180 million. 
As we have mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. While the technology investments had downside with losses for this quarter, overall for the fiscal year, our investments provided approximately $500 million of unrealized gains.
In addition, and most important, our investments continue to add value to our core homebuilding operations. And then turning to our balance sheet. For the quarter and the year, focused on becoming land lighter. As a result, at quarter end, we owned 182,000 homesites and controlled 257,000 homesites for a total of 439,000 home sites.
Our year supply owned decreased to 3 years from 3.5 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increased to 59% from 39% in the prior year. We were also laser-focused on generating cash flow, reducing debt and increasing returns, as you've heard. Therefore, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility.
We also retired $850 million of senior notes that were due in 2022. Together with $300 million of senior notes paid in the third quarter, we retired a total of $1.15 billion of senior notes in 2021. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which is due in November 2022, and we have no maturities due in fiscal '23.
Also during the quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares totaling $977 million, bringing the total repurchase for the full year to 14 million shares, totaling almost $1.4 billion or 4.5% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $76 million which brings total cash return to shareholders for dividends for the year to $310 million.
The result of all these transactions was a homebuilding debt to total capital of 18.3%, which was down from 24.9% in the prior year. As you can see, our primary focus was cash generation and capital allocation during 2021, but it's the continuation of our multiyear strategy. 
During fiscal 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. However, over the past 3 years, 2019 through 2021, we generated about $8 billion of homebuilding cash flow and allocated approximately $5 billion of debt reduction as our first priority, approximately $2 billion to share buybacks and approximately $600 million was returned to shareholders through dividend payments. 
And this focus will, of course, continue in 2022. And just a final few points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $21 billion. Our book value per share increased to [ $69.52 ]. Our return on inventory was 27%, excluding consolidated inventory not owned. And our return on equity was 22.6%.
So with that brief overview, I'd like to provide some detailed guidance for the first quarter and then high-level guidance for fiscal 2022, starting with the first quarter.
We expect our Q1 new orders to be in the range of 14,800 to 15,100 homes. As you heard us say, as we continue to moderate sales pace to match production cycle changes. This is consistent with the approach we have taken for quite a while.
We expect our Q1 inventory -- I'm sorry, our Q1 ending community count to be about 5% lower than the end of year 2021. However, community count will then increase in the second quarter, and we should end 2022 with low double-digit year-over-year growth. 
We believe our Q1 deliveries will be around 12,500. But similar to last quarter, the assessment has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges continue to bring a great deal of uncertainty.
So the final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes to the supply chain challenges which, of course, we are navigating each and every day. Our Q1 average sales price should be about $460,000, and we expect our gross margin to be around 26.75% which reflects the impact of peak lumber prices from last year and less field expense leverage.
We expect our SG&A to be between 7.8% and 7.9% as we continue to continue to focus on simplification and efficiencies. Now I will note again that gross margin and SG&A estimates will move up or down a bit depending on the number of homes delivered. And for the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of approximately $5 million.
Looking at our other business segments and other additional items. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $85 million to $90 million as market competition for purchased business continues. We expect a loss of about $10 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect to be about breakeven. 
But remember, this guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments, this will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2% of total revenue.
Our charitable foundation will be based on $1,000 per home, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. And the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 297 million shares. 
And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.54 to $2.57 per share for the first quarter. And then turning to the full year 2022. We expect to deliver approximately 67,000 homes with an average sales price of about $460,000. 
This would result in about $31 billion of homebuilding revenue, which should be an increase of approximately 20% from fiscal 2021. We expect our full year gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%. And with our continued focus on technology and efficiencies, we expect our fiscal year SG&A to decrease to the range of 6.8% to 6.9%. 
We believe our financial services earnings will be in the range of $440 million to $450 million as market competition continues. And finally, our tax rate should be approximately 25%. And so as we continue to execute on our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned to have a strong fiscal year 2022.
Before I turn it over to the operator, let me take a moment to thank our finance teams, accounting, planning and all others involved. Our earnings release went out yesterday, 15 days after year-end, and we are hosting our earnings call today, 16 days after year-end.
We've been holding our quarterly calls within this general time frame for over a year. Although the time frames have been consistent, make no mistake, the work is continued. Our goal is to not be satisfied with what has been accomplished, but rather to make incremental progress through automation and efficiencies each and every quarter while we compile and report our actual or forecasted results.
The incremental progress is the result of a lot of hard work. So congratulations teams and a sincere thank you for what you've accomplished this year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator."

Let me -- before answering the question, I just want to second Diane's congratulations to the finance team with David Collins sitting here. A lot of hard work goes into getting the year and quarter close, and they're doing a great job. 
But let me answer that, Susan. The reality that we're seeing in the field, as we have come to our year-end and even as we go into December is the market remains strong traditional seasonality is coming back, but still relative to that seasonality, we're seeing basic strength in the marketplace. 
The constraining factor right now is the production cycle. And we have been decidedly focused on matching our sales pace with that production cycle, recognizing that we're going to maximize execution in bottom line by keeping those 2 pieces in parity. So as we think about the upcoming selling season, it is feeling to us -- as we look at the market, as we look at week-by-week sales, traffic, demand, it is feeling to us that this is going to be a very, very strong selling season. 
It is going to be more of a traditional selling season in that -- as we get to the end of February, March, we expect to see even more of a pickup. But make no mistake, it's strong out there right now. With that said, the production cycle, as I've noted, the cycle times have been extending through the quarters. We're cognizant of that. 
We recognize that it's a bit of, as Jon said, whack-a-mole out there. One day, it's garage doors, another day, it's windows or paint. And that kind of configuration is at least in our world, starting to feel like we're stabilizing it. I noted our purchasing team and the work that they have done around our Builder of Choice programs or Everything's Included programs, working to really stabilize that purchasing side and logistics side of our business. 
And as we go forward, I think you're going to see that parity, that pairing of production cycles stabilizing and high demand in the marketplace start to move things towards what I think is going to be more of an upside in 2022. And we'll just have to wait and see if it plays out that way.
We've clearly conservatized some of our numbers to recognize the landscape that exists today, and we'll see how the market plays out as we go forward."

Your first question relative to the SpinCo, we have been -- look, you have to -- as we configured SpinCo, we've gone back and forth on an asset-heavier, asset-lighter approach.
We think that in terms of defining the company going forward, our best program going forward is an asset-light approach to SpinCo. That means that many of the assets that we targeted at the outset will end up either an AUM or we will liquidate an orderly course on the Lennar book.
It's still the same basic configuration of asset base. We've just been -- it's all been about turning assets into cash and deploying the cash or deploying the assets so that we lighten up our inventory and we end up with a spun ancillary business program that enables that pure-play focus on homebuilding and financial services. 
So it's kind of a zero-sum game. The asset base is still the same. It's just where the asset is going to fall. It's going to fall balance sheet, AUM or liquidation and all of it's going to basically solve to the same equation."

So you see a little bit of a minor down in the first quarter, but our margins are still coming in at a very strong level, and you see that in our look forward to 2022. And I'd just say that, Mike, relative to looking ahead, it's always difficult to look out numerous quarters, particularly in the market where labor and materials and logistics are moving around, I think that we feel pretty optimistic about our margins as we go forward.

So that's pretty consistent with previous years. But given how unusual and crazy the supply chain was in 4Q and your earlier comments that you think that it's going to start to get better, I'm kind of curious why you're not expecting that you could close more homes relative to what you just did in the 4Q than in prior years. And then at a higher level, once your cycle times do stabilize or even contract, I'm curious how you're going to balance orders relative to your production.

Relative to sales, as Stuart has commented, as Rick commented, we see a very strong sales environment.

And despite the fact that there was this massive unforeseen spike in lumber costs and scrambling costs from the supply chain and all that. And so you've addressed the lumber a little bit in the fact that the first quarter is going to have a little bit of a headwind. I assume you meant by that, that the $4.18 increase is going to be bigger -- bigger than in the first quarter. I just want to confirm that. Maybe Diane, you can confirm that?
But then the other big part of it is home price, right? So nationally, home prices look like they're still rising at about 1% a month. You just mentioned that you think a strong selling season is going to drive your ASP higher. But your ASP guide for the full year 2022 is actually below the order price that you booked this quarter.

I think the supply chain disruptions, I can't predict what's going to actually happen in the field. But what we've done, we've put buffers out there and increased starts. Our Builder of Choice program working with our subcontractor base, our building partner base, to activate kind of safeguards and programming to enable a better delivery system and logistics system.
